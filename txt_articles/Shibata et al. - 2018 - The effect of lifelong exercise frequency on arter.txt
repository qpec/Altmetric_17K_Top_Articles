Key points
r This study examined the effect of different ‘doses’ of lifelong (>25 years) exercise on arterial
stiffening (a hallmark of vascular ageing) in older adults.
r There are clear dose-dependent effects of lifelong exercise training on human arterial stiffness
that vary according to the site and size of the arteries.
r Similar to what we have observed previously with ventricular stiffening, 4–5 days week−1 of
committed exercise over a lifetime are necessary to preserve ‘youthful’ vascular compliance,
especially of the large central arteries.
r Casual exercise training of two to three times per week may be sufficient for middle-sized
arteries like the carotid to minimize arterial stiffening with ageing.
r However, there is little effect of exercise training on the small-sized peripheral arteries at any
dose.
Abstract Central arterial stiffness increases with sedentary ageing. While near-daily, vigorous
lifelong (>25 years) endurance exercise training prevents arterial stiffening with ageing, this
rigorous routine of exercise training over a lifetime is impractical for most individuals. The aim
was to examine whether a less frequent ‘dose’ of lifelong exercise training (four to five sessions
per week for > 30 min) that is consistent with current physical activity recommendations elicits
similar benefits on central arterial stiffening with ageing. A cross-sectional examination of 102
seniors(>60yearsold)whohadaconsistentlifelongexercisehistorywasperformed.Subjectswere
stratified into four groups based on exercise frequency as an index of exercise ‘dose’: sedentary:
fewer than two sessions per week; casual exercisers: two to three sessions per week; committed
exercisers: four to five sessions per week; and Masters athletes: six to seven sessions per week plus
Shigeki Shibata had a great interest in the field of exercise physiology and ageing when he graduated from the School of
Medicine, Niigata University (1998). After completing an initial clinical practice of anaesthesiology in Japan, he worked on a
PhD in Anaesthesiology and Environmental Physiology focusing on cardiovascular physiology, exercise training and anaesthesia
in Nihon University (2002–2006). In order to extend his skills and knowledge, he worked in the Institute for Exercise and
Environmental Medicine (2005–2011). Currently, he is working in the School of Medicine, Kyorin University to further explore

regular competitions. Detailed measurements of arterial stiffness and left ventricular afterload
were collected. Biological aortic age and central pulse wave velocity were younger in committed
exercisers and Masters athletes compared to sedentary seniors. Total arterial compliance index
(TACi) was lower, while carotid β-stiffness index and effective arterial elastance were higher in
sedentary seniors compared to the other groups. There appeared to be a dose–response threshold
for carotid β-stiffness index and TACi. Peripheral arterial stiffness was not significantly different
among the groups. These data suggest that four to five weekly exercise sessions over a lifetime
is associated with reduced central arterial stiffness in the elderly. A less frequent dose of lifelong
exercise (two to three sessions per week) is associated with decreased ventricular afterload and
peripheral resistance, while peripheral arterial stiffness is unaffected by any dose of exercise.

Introduction
A notable consequence of sedentary ageing is large-vessel
arterial stiffening. This pathophysiological process is
characterized by the development of fibrosis and collagen
cross-linked products in the arterial wall. Central arterial
stiffening increases the risk of cardiovascular-related
morbidity and mortality in older adults (Vlachopoulos
et al. 2010); thus, the development of strategies to forestall
age-associatedcardiovascular(CV)diseaseshasimportant
clinical implications.
Sustained, regular endurance exercise training is one
such favourable strategy. We and others have pre-
viously shown that Masters athletes who have performed
near-daily (6–7 sessions per week) vigorous endurance
exercise training plus competition for the majority of their
adult lives have more compliant central arteries compared
to their sedentary peers (Vaitkevicius et al. 1993; Gates
et al. 2003; Shibata & Levine, 2011, 2012). While these
findings support others (Arbab-Zadeh et al. 2004; Bhella
etal.2014)fromourlaboratorythatunderscorethecritical
role of sustained, lifelong physical activity in mitigating
ventricular and arterial stiffening with ageing, the rigorous
training and competition routine of Masters athletes is not
feasible or practical for most individuals.
Previously, we showed in these same subjects that a less
frequent ‘dose’ of lifelong exercise training (4–5 sessions
per week for >30 min) that is consistent with current
physical activity recommendations (�150 min week−1)
prevents cardiac atrophy and stiffening associated with
sedentary ageing (Bhella et al. 2014). Moreover, this
volume of exercise training was associated with higher
maximal oxygen uptake ( ˙
VO2max), stroke index and
effective arterial elastance index (Eai) during exercise
(Carrick-Ranson et al. 2014). Since resting Ea increases
with sedentary ageing as a result of ventricular and central
arterial stiffening (Redfield et al. 2005), four to five
sessions per week of dynamic exercise over a lifetime may
also be an effective and practical exercise frequency to
prevent both ventricular and central arterial stiffening
with ageing. However, the effects of different doses of
life-long exercise training on arterial compliance with
ageing is still unclear.
Accordingly, to test the hypothesis that a threshold dose
of four to five weekly exercise sessions over a lifetime
would be associated with a reduction in central arterial
stiffness, we performed a cross-sectional examination
of detailed measurements of central arterial stiffness in
seniors (>60 years) who had performed a consistent
frequency of exercise training for >25 years, focusing
on weekly exercise frequency as an index of exercise
dose.
Methods
Ethical approval
All subjects signed an informed consent approved by the
institutional review boards of the University of Texas
Southwestern and Texas Health Resources Presbyterian
Hospital of Dallas and performed in accordance with the
Declaration of Helsinki.
Subject recruitment
Details of the subject recruitment process and study
design were reported previously (Bhella et al. 2014;
Carrick-Ranson et al. 2014). One hundred and two healthy
seniorswererecruitedandstratifiedintofourgroupsbased
on lifelong frequency of exercise training. Sedentary sub-
jects (n = 27) exercised no more than once per week
during the previous 25 years, ‘casual’ exercisers (n = 25)
engaged in two to three sessions per week, ‘committed’
exercisers (n = 25) performed four to five sessions per
week and competitive Masters athletes (n = 25) trained
six to seven times per week and participated in regular
competitions. Exercise sessions were defined as periods of
aerobic exercise of at least 30 min.

Subjects were recruited primarily from the Cooper
Center Longitudinal Study (CCLS; Wei et al. 1999),
a cohort of more than 80,000 individuals in whom
physical
activity
and
CV
risk
factors
have
been
quantified and followed for >40 years. Using the CCLS
database, investigators identified healthy subjects who had
consistently reported the same level of regular exercise on
clinic questionnaires over multiple visits spanning at least
20 years. Interested subjects underwent a comprehensive
exercise history examination conducted by an experienced
exercise physiologist and assisted by family members
when possible. If exercise histories could be corroborated,
subjects were invited to participate in the next phase
of screening. The sedentary population was enriched
with subjects recruited from local senior groups such
as bingo, gardening, volunteer groups and health fairs
(mostsubjectsinthisgroupcamefromnon-CooperClinic
sources). The Masters athlete population was enriched
by direct recruitment from the top performers (10–15%)
at regional and national endurance events (Arbab-Zadeh
etal.2004)with mostselected fromraceresults.Regardless
of the source of referral, however, all subjects were
equally well vetted and rigorously screened in terms
of medical history, physical examination and detailed
exercise training history.
All
recruited
subjects
underwent
the
following
screening protocol. First, a medical history and physical
exam were recorded by a study physician and/or nurse.
Obesity (BMI > 30 kg m−2), regular tobacco use within
the past 10 years, hypertension (24 h ambulatory blood
pressure > 140/90 mmHg), diabetes, chronic obstructive
pulmonarydisease,atrialfibrillation,obstructivecoronary
artery disease or significant valvular disease were exclusion
criteria. Second, an exercise stress test was performed
on all subjects, with ECG or echocardiography changes
suggestive of ischaemia or abnormal wall motion criteria
for exclusion.
Assessment of arterial stiffness
Biological
aortic
age. Biological
aortic
age
was
determined from the central aortic arterial pressure
waveform using the Modelflow algorithm as previously
described (Shibata & Levine, 2011). First, using input
ages from 20 to 90 years, Modelflow stroke volume (SV)
was generated from a central blood pressure waveform
reconstructed from a finger blood pressure waveform
(Beatscope 1.1a; Finapres Medical Systems, Enschede, the
Netherlands; Wesseling et al. 1993). Biological aortic age
was then determined by an inverse function of the linear
regression between input age and generated Modelflow
SV equation by using SV from the acetylene rebreathing
method (Jarvis et al. 2007) as an input signal. This
index has been previously validated in our laboratory,
demonstrating a high age specificity in sedentary adults,
and high reproducibility in response to changes in
haemodynamic loading conditions (Shibata & Levine,
2012).
Pulse wave velocity. Central, and upper and lower limb
peripheral pulse wave velocity (PWV) was measured
with Doppler ultrasound (iE 33, Phillips, Amsterdam,
the Netherlands) and calculated as the distance between
measurement sites divided by the time delay between the
two waveforms (Laurent et al. 2006). Pulse transit time was
calculated by subtracting the time between the peak of the
R-wave and the foot of the carotid flow profile from the
time between the peak of the R-wave and the foot of the
femoral flow for central PWV, and carotid from radial flow
profiles and femoral from dorsal flow profiles for upper
limb and lower limb peripheral PWV, respectively. The
peak of the R-wave and the foot of the flow profile were
visually determined by the same researcher. The distance
between arterial measurement sites was calculated by sub-
tracting the distance between the carotid site and the
sternal notch from the distance between the sternal notch
and the femoral site, and between the sternal notch and
the radial site for central and upper limb peripheral PWV,
and between femoral and dorsal for lower limb peripheral
PWV, respectively. Central PWV (carotid–femoral) and
upper limb peripheral PWV (carotid–radial) were also
measured with SphygmoCor Mx device (AtCor Medical,
Itasca,IL,USA).Bloodpressurewaveformsweremeasured
just before Doppler flow measurements and these pressure
waveforms were used for analysing augmentation indices
and carotid artery stiffness indices. Intraclass correlation
coefficient (ICC) of central PWV between the Doppler
method and SphygmoCor was relatively high (ICC: 0.742,
95% confidence interval: 0.576–0.843), while that of
upper limb peripheral PWV was low (ICC: 0.168, 95%
confidence interval: −0.350 to 0.488).

with applanation tonometry (SphygmoCor, Mx) was
immediately followed by brachial arm cuff blood pressure
measurement (Korotkoff sounds detected using electro-
sphygmomanometry; SunTech Medical, Morrisville, NC,
USA). Systemic diastolic and mean blood pressures were
estimated from the brachial blood pressure waveform
calibrated with arm-cuff systolic and diastolic blood
pressures. These mean and diastolic blood pressures were
used to calibrate a right common carotid blood pressure
waveform to obtain carotid systolic (Ps) and diastolic

blood pressures (Pd) (Kelly & Fitchett, 1992; Laurent
et al. 2006). The cross-sectional area of the right common
carotid artery was measured from the images acquired
with a high-resolution (Sono-CT) linear-array ultrasound
(Phillips iE33) transducer (� 9 MHz). The measurements
were made 1–2 cm proximal to the carotid bulb, with the
transducer placed at a 90° angle to the vessel so that near
and far wall interfaces were clearly discernible. Acoustic
quantification was applied for the edge detection of the
internal arterial wall (Q-Lab, Phillips), and maximum
and minimum areas were to be considered systolic (As)
and diastolic (Ad) areas.
Ascending and descending aortic β-stiffness indices
were calculated from simultaneous cardiac MRI aortic
cross-sectional area and brachial cuff blood pressure
measurements. Moreover, ascending and descending
aortic strain were also calculated only from the aortic
cross-sectional area since central blood pressures were
not available during the MRI measurement. MRI of the
aortic arch was obtained in the transverse plane at the
level of the right pulmonary artery using a 1.5 T clinical
magnetic resonance scanner (NT model; Philips Corp.,
Amsterdam, the Netherlands) to assess aortic pulsative
dimensions (Redheuil et al. 2011). MRI data were
analysed using commercially available software (Q-flow,
NEXA Group Pty Ltd, New South Wales, Australia) and
maximum and minimum areas were considered systolic
(As) and diastolic (Ad) areas. The β-stiffness index of
the carotid artery and the ascending and descending
aortas, the distensibility coefficient of the carotid
artery and the strain of the ascending and descending
aortas were calculated by the following equations,
respectively: β-stiffness index=ln(Ps/Pd)/{(As-Ad)/Ad},
distensibility
coefficient={(As-Ad)/Ad}/(Ps-Pd),
and
Strain=(As-Ad)/Ad.
Augmentation
index. Carotid
augmentation
blood
pressure was quantified as the difference between the first
and second systolic peaks (Pauca et al. 2001; Laurent
et al. 2006). The carotid blood pressure augmentation
index was calculated as augmentation pressure expressed
as a percentage of the pulse pressure determined with
SphygmoCor Mx (Pauca et al. 2001; Laurent et al.
2006). The central augmentation pressure and index were
calculated with a central pressure waveform reconstructed
from radial blood pressure waveform by the inverse trans-
fer function method with SphygmoCor Mx (Chen et al.
1997; Pauca et al. 2001). To reduce the confounding
effectofheartrate,augmentationindiceswereadditionally
normalized to a heart rate of 75 bpm.
Total arterial compliance, effective arterial elastance and
total peripheral resistance. Total arterial compliance
(TAC) was calculated from stroke volume (SV) using
the acetylene rebreathing method (Jarvis et al. 2007)
divided by central arterial pulse pressure reconstructed
fromtheradialbloodpressurewaveform(SV/centralpulse
pressure). Ea and total peripheral resistance (TPR) were
calculated as central systolic pressure/SV and 80 × cardiac
output/central mean pressure, respectively (Sunagawa
et al. 1983; Kelly et al. 1992; Chemla et al. 2003).
To reduce the confounding effect of body size, stroke
index (SVi) was used for the calculation of TACi, Eai
and TPRi.
Statistics
A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to
determine differences in variables among the four groups.
Post-hoc analysis (Student–Newman–Keuls method) was
performed when a significant main effect was found.
The partial η2 of the one-way ANOVA was used to
estimate effect size for primary outcome variables. A
chi-square test was used to determine gender differences
between groups. Commercially available software was
used to perform all analyses (SigmaStat 3.5, Systat
Software, Inc., San Jose, CA, USA; SPSS 22.0, IBM Corp.,
Armonk, NY, USA). P < 0.05 was considered statistically
significant for ANOVA and post hoc analysis. Data are pre-
sented as the mean ± standard deviation in tables and
figures.

in a dose-dependent manner as reported previously
(Bhella

Blood pressure, stroke volume and related indices
Resting SV and SVi increased with a greater frequency of
lifelong exercise training (Table 2). Arm cuff measures of
systolic blood pressure tended to be higher, and central
systolic and mean blood pressures were significantly
higher in sedentary seniors (P � 0.016 versus casual and
committed exercisers) (Table 2). TACi was lower, while
Eai was higher in sedentary seniors compared to the other
groups (Table 2). Augmentation indices were not different
among the groups (Table 3).

Arterial stiffness
Biological aortic age was younger, while central PWV was
lower in committed and Masters athletes compared to a
lower frequency of lifelong exercise training (P � 0.066
versus casual exercisers and sedentary seniors) (Figs. 1
and 2). In contrast, carotid artery β-stiffness index was
significantly higher in sedentary seniors compared to
the other groups (P � 0.047), but not between the
three exercise-trained groups (Fig. 3). Similarly, the
carotid distensibility coefficient was significantly lower in
sedentary seniors compared to the other groups. Upper
and lower limb peripheral PWVs were not significantly
different among groups (Table 3).
Discussion
The major findings from the present study were as
follows: (1) four to five weekly sessions of exercise over
a lifetime was associated with a reduction in central
arterial stiffness in seniors, similar to what we have pre-
viously observed regarding myocardial stiffness; (2) a life-
long casual exercise frequency (2–3 sessions per week)
was associated with lower carotid artery stiffness, left
ventricular afterload (Eai) and central blood pressures
in the seniors, while this dose of exercise training did
not affect the central arterial stiffness; and (3) peri-
pheral arterial stiffness was unaffected by lifelong exercise
training, irrespective of ‘dose’. These current findings
extend previous observations from our laboratory (Bhella
et al. 2014; Carrick-Ranson et al. 2014) and others
(Vaitkevicius et al. 1993; Gates et al. 2003) underscoring
the favourable effects of aerobic exercise for > 30 min,
four to five times per week throughout a lifetime on the
adverse consequences of ageing on CV stiffening.
Central artery stiffness
In the present study, central arterial stiffness was
comprehensively examined using established approaches
such as central PWV and the aortic β-stiffness index,
as well as a newer index estimating the biological (as
opposed to the chronological) age of the aorta. Pre-
vious work from our laboratory demonstrates that this
latter approach, which conceptually reflects structural
changes of the aortic wall, accurately identifies sedentary
ageing and lifelong exercise training-related changes in
aortic stiffness (Shibata & Levine, 2011). It is especially
compelling that all indices studied in the current work,
which used completely different sensors and analytic
approaches to quantify large vessel stiffening, found
similar patterns in large vessel arterial stiffening in
response to graded lifelong exercise frequency; specifically,
engageing in more than three sessions per week over a
lifetime resulted in more ‘youthful’ measures compared

approximately 10 and 25 years younger in committed
exercisers and competitive Masters athletes, respectively.
These findings are important as large epidemiological
studies have shown that central arterial stiffness assessed
by PWV is a strong independent predictor of CV-related
and all-cause mortality in older adults (Vlachopoulos et al.
2010). Moreover, although the clinical impact of biological
aortic age for predicting future CV events has not been
confirmed by large epidemiological studies, this index
provides strong physiological confirmation that changes

in central arterial stiffness with exercise training measured
in this and other studies (Vaitkevicius et al. 1993; Tanaka
et al. 1998; Tanaka et al. 2000; Gates et al. 2003; Pierce
et al. 2013) are not secondary to central blood pressure
changes.
In contrast, the central aortic β-stiffness index was
not significantly improved with lifelong exercise training,
irrespective of weekly exercise frequency. The apparent
absence of a training effect in our findings may be
related to study methodology including the use of
cuff pressure rather than central blood pressure, due
to the technical difficulties in using the tonometry
instrumentation
in
the
MRI
due
to
the
strong
magnetic field. The simultaneous collection of aortic
dimensions and central blood pressure would provide
the most precise assessment of aortic β-stiffness. Thus,
given that we found divergent effects on cuff and
central blood pressures in relation to lifelong exercise
frequency, some caution should be exercised regarding
the interpretation of the current aortic β-stiffness
findings.
Carotid artery stiffness
We found that the carotid β-stiffness index was higher in
sedentary seniors, but similar among the exercise-trained
groups, suggesting that only small beneficial effects are
obtainedabovealowfrequencyoflifelongexercisetraining
(2–3 sessions per week). Thus, a large beneficial effect
was obtained with relatively low levels of exercise, which
is consistent with what has been previously reported
in several epidemiological studies of exercise and CV
risk. However, Tanaka et al. (2000) found that carotid
C

β-stiffness index was significantly improved only in highly
endurance trained (� 5 sessions per week) but not
in recreationally active (3–4 sessions per week) senior
men compared to their sedentary peers. We speculate
that the discrepancy between study findings is related
to methodological differences in the exercise histories of
the exercise trained subjects, as Tanaka et al. examined
senior men with a consistent exercise history of > 2 years,
while we examined senior men and women with a
consistent exercise training history > 25 years. This
point is important, as the age when exercise training is
begun may determine the effectiveness of exercise training
to improve CV structure and function, particularly in
propertieslikeventricularorlargebloodvesselcompliance
(Fujimoto et al. 2010; Shibata & Levine, 2012). Therefore,
the initiation of exercise training earlier in life coupled
with a longer exercise training history may explain
why we observed significant improvements in carotid
stiffening with a less frequent dose of lifelong exercise
training.
Similar to carotid β-stiffness, systolic blood pressures
were increased in sedentary seniors. Since the carotid
sinus is the site of the carotid baroreflex, it is possible
that improved baroreflex function due to a compliant
carotid artery lowers systolic blood pressure. In addition,
central systolic blood pressure is influenced by alterations
in the interaction between forward traveling and reflected
waves, mostly by reductions in timing and amplitude
of reflected waves. Although augmentation indices did
not show significant differences, changes in these factors
may be another underlying mechanism of lower central
blood pressure. These findings suggest that even a
modest frequency of lifelong exercise training provokes
favourable effects in central blood pressure regulatory
mechanisms.
Peripheral artery stiffness
In contrast to central arterial stiffness, we were unable
to show any clear effect on peripheral blood vessels. Pre-
vious studies have reported conflicting findings regarding
the effect of aerobic exercise training on peripheral
arterial stiffness, with significant improvements reported
in young, healthy middle-aged (Rakobowchuk et al. 2008;
Currie et al. 2009) or pre-hypertensive individuals (Collier
etal.2008),whileeither noeffector avery smallfavourable
effect has been observed in healthy adults of varying ages
and fitness levels (Tanaka et al. 1998; Hayashi et al. 2005;
Cook et al. 2006).
Differences among previous findings appear to be
influenced by study design, as the majority of longitudinal
training studies have shown positive findings (Collier
et al. 2008; Rakobowchuk et al. 2008; Currie et al. 2009),
while cross-sectional examinations including the current
study report no effect (Tanaka et al. 1998; Cook
et al. 2006). A likely explanation for these findings
is that the inter-individual difference in peripheral
arterial compliance is larger than that of intra-individual
difference resulting from exercise training. The smaller
effect size of peripheral PWV (partial η2 = 0.021 for upper
limb and 0.018 for lower limb) compared to central PWV
(partial η2 = 0.191) observed in the present study supports
this contention.
In addition, we visually detect the foot of flow wave-
form to calculate time differences. More sophisticated
approaches such as the intersecting tangents or second
derivative method may have revealed positive findings by
reducing variability.
Potential underlying mechanisms
Arteriosclerosis with sedentary ageing is characterized
by profound structural remodelling of the arterial wall
including the accumulation of connective tissue and
extracellular collagen cross-linked products (advanced
glycation end-products), and the degeneration of elastin
(Lakatta, 2003; Lakatta & Levy, 2003). Previously, we have
reported that biological aortic age is younger, indicative of
more compliant central blood vessels in Masters athletes
compared to age-matched sedentary controls (Shibata
& Levine, 2011). This finding provides evidence that
sustained, vigorous lifelong endurance exercise training
may inhibit the adverse vascular remodelling associated
with human ageing. Conversely, 1 year of exercise training,
encompassing over 200 min per week of moderate and
high-intensity exercise, failed to substantially improve
biological aortic age in previously sedentary seniors
(Shibata & Levine, 2012). This latter finding suggests
that the age-related changes in large elastic blood vessel
structure are not reversible by exercise training alone when
initiated later in life.
Vascular functional adaptations, which are influenced
by smooth muscle tone and endothelial function, also
characterize the improved arterial compliance with
exercise training. For example, endothelial function is
improved with lifelong exercise training and with several
monthsofexercisetraininginpreviouslysedentaryseniors
(Luk et al. 2012; Shibata & Levine, 2012; Cornelissen et al.
2014; Kim et al. 2014). It is likely that the peripheral
vasculature, particularly the arterioles where the majority
of vascular resistance is produced, is strongly influenced
by these training-related effects. In the present study, total
arterial compliance, blood pressures and cardiac afterload,
which are all influenced by smooth muscle tone, were
improved with even a modest (2–3 sessions per week)
amount of lifelong exercise. These current findings are
similar to that reported with 1 year of endurance training
in previously sedentary seniors (Shibata & Levine, 2012)

suggesting that the functional components of arterial
compliance appears to be more readily influenced by
exercise training compared to structural components,
particularly if exercise is initiated later in life.
Perspective
Given the importance of vascular stiffening to health and
clinical outcomes with human ageing, it is important
to develop strategies to forestall age-related CV diseases.
Exercise training is one approach; however, as noted in a
recent review (Seals, 2014), the minimal and/or optimal
dose of exercise training to preserve or improve vascular
structure and function with human ageing has yet to
be clearly established. The present findings constitute
an important step in this process by demonstrating the
minimal frequency of lifelong exercise required to pre-
serve compliant central arteries in older age. Importantly,
this minimum exercise frequency is consistent with and
strengthens current recommendations for weekly physical
activity (� 150 min week−1).
Moreover,severalindicesfromthepresentstudyshowed
significant differences between sedentary and casual
exercisers (carotid β-stiffness index, central SP, central MP
and Eai); however, there appears to be a dose–response
threshold for carotid β-stiffness index and TACi (i.e. no
significant difference among the exercise-trained groups).
This finding emphasizes the clinical importance of a lesser
amount (2–3 times per week) of weekly aerobic exercise
on vascular stiffness and blood pressures.
According to previous large epidemiological studies,
the reference values of PWV, carotid distensibility
coefficient and central blood pressure in a healthy
70 year old were approximately 10.4 m s−1, 13.8
and 114 mmHg, respectively (Herbert et al. 2014;
Cunha et al. 2015; Engelen et al. 2015). Thus, the
sedentary subjects in this current study are comparable
in terms of arterial stiffness and blood pressures to
what has been previously reported in the general
population, supporting the generalizability of the present
findings.
Study limitations
First, this study did not invasively examine the structural
and functional adaptations associated with lifelong
exercise training frequency; only non-invasive techniques
were employed. While invasive assessment of vascular
tissue by biopsy would provide the most compelling
evidence of structural remodelling, this is not practical
in healthy individuals. Second, factors (dietary intake,
non-exercise physical activity levels, social background,
educational levels and economic status) not assessed in the
current study may influence adherence to exercise training
over a lifetime, and consequently arterial compliance.
Moreover, small group differences in BP and BMI may
have influenced the current findings even though these
effects were not statistically significant and these variables
were within normal ranges; therefore, we cannot exclude
the possibility that the improved arterial compliance
demonstrated in our trained subjects is achieved by
more than exercise training alone. Accordingly, we also
performed ANCOVA including BMI and central blood
pressure as covariates and obtained similar results,
indicating that effects of modifying these risk factors per
se are likely to be small. Third, group allocation was
based on lifelong exercise frequency, thus limiting any
conclusions based on other components of an exercise
training programme including intensity, duration or
mode, all of which may have a profound impact on
the vascular adaptations to exercise training. Fourth,
this study was not designed to focus on sex difference
of exercise effects. Thus, future studies are required
to properly address sex differences. Our preliminary
analysis did not show any significant interactions for
sex and exercise frequency, while borderline significance
was observed in the carotid artery β-stiffness index and
distensibility coefficient (P = 0.077 and P = 0.079,
two-way ANOVA). Fifth, our subjects were non-obese and
normotensive, and were carefully screened for CV disease;
therefore, it is unclear whether these current results
are applicable to a broader population of patients with
greater amounts of co-morbidities and CV disease risk
factors. Sixth, we must acknowledge that there were some
small differences in probability observed in quantifying
the changes in central PWV among groups between
the Doppler and SphygmoCor devices. Considering
that both methods show similar directionality and
magnitude, albeit it with different statistical probabilities,
we are reasonably confident that the conclusion is
correct.
Lastly,
the
Student–Newman–Keuls
multiple
comparison test was used for post hoc analysis in
the present study. Since this test does not limit the chance
of a Type I error at 5%, some positive results need to
be carefully interpreted given the subject number in the
present study.
Conclusions
In summary, these current findings suggest that > 4–5
weekly sessions of committed lifelong exercise is associated
with a more ‘youthful’ levels of central artery compliance
in the elderly. A lower frequency of lifelong exercise (2–3
sessions per week) is associated with improved carotid
artery compliance and decreased left ventricular afterload.
Irrespective of frequency, lifelong exercise training does
not significantly influence peripheral arterial stiffness.
