ABSTRACT
Long-term alcohol use affects cognitive and neurophysiological functioning as well as structural brain development.
Combining simultaneous electroencephalogram (EEG) recording with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) en-
ables direct, in vivo exploration of cortical excitability and assessment of effective and functional connectivity. In
the central nervous system, the effects of alcohol are particularly mediated by alterations in gamma-aminobutyric
acid (GABA)ergic neurotransmission, and TMS-evoked potentials (TEPs) N45 and N100 in EEG are known to reflect
GABAergic function. However, no previous studies have examined the effects of long-term alcohol use in adoles-
cence on TEPs. In this study, a total of 27 young adults with heavy alcohol use in adolescence and 25 age-
matched, gender-matched and education-matched controls with little or no alcohol use participated in TMS–EEG
measurements. The motor cortex (M1) was stimulated with an intensity of 90 percent of the resting motor thresh-
old of the abductor pollicis brevis muscle. No significant differences were found in the resting motor threshold, TEP
latencies or neuropsychological functioning between the groups. We observed an increase in the global mean field
power in the time window of 54- to 75-millisecond post-TMS, as well as significant topographical differences in the
P60 and N100 in those with a history of heavy drinking. Furthermore, there was a marked increase in the
GABAergic N45 amplitude in alcohol users. These findings suggest that long-term alcohol use in adolescence, even
when not meeting the diagnostic criteria for a disorder, is associated with changes in connectivity and cortical
excitability.

INTRODUCTION
The adverse effects of alcohol on adult brain functions
have been known since the studies of Wernicke and
Korsakoff in the 1880s (Adams & Victor 1989; Zubaran
et al. 1997). In recent research, more knowledge on
ethanol-induced changes in the young developing brain
has been gained. In adolescence, the brain and cognition
undergo parallel development, and domains such as so-
cial skills, executive functioning and attention develop.
These domains are known to deteriorate in chronic alco-
hol abuse in adults (Arain et al. 2013, reviewed in Bava &
Tapert 2010 and Hermens et al. 2013).
The effects of alcohol on the central nervous sys-
tem are mediated by changes in neurotransmission,
predominantly in gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)
ergic, glutamatergic and dopaminergic systems (revie-
wed in Hillmer et al. 2015). GABA is the major
inhibitory and glutamate is the major excitatory neu-
rotransmitter in the central nervous system (reviewed
in Hillmer et al. 2015). The GABA and glutamate
systems
together
regulate
dopaminergic
projections
from the ventral tegmental area to striatal and limbic
regions and maintain the inhibition–excitation bal-
ance
throughout
the
brain
(reviewed
in
Hillmer
et al. 2015).

 The GABA acts through ionotropic GABAA receptors
(GABAARs)
and
metabotropic
GABAB
receptors
(GABABRs) (reviewed in Lobo & Harris 2008), and gluta-
mate through ionotropic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA),
α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid
and kainate receptors and some metabotropic receptors
(reviewed in Hillmer et al. 2015). Chronic alcohol con-
sumption leads to changes in neurotransmission, induc-
ing increased GABAAR plasticity, a hyperglutamatergic
state and increased dopamine release in the reward
neurocircuitry (reviewed in Liang & Olsen 2014 and
Holmes et al. 2013). In alcohol dependence, extracellu-
lar glutamate levels and NMDA-receptor expression
increase, leading to more effective excitatory signalling
and reduced NMDA-R sensitivity to alcohol (reviewed
in Hillmer et al. 2015 and Holmes et al. 2013). Even
moderate alcohol use stimulates GABAARs, primarily
extrasynaptic receptors, which respond to ethanol. This
induces dynamic changes in the receptors. On the basis
of rodent studies, it appears that GABAARs are involved
in drinking patterns and that there might be some un-
derlying genetic vulnerabilities to alcohol dependence
(reviewed in Liang & Olsen 2014). On the other hand,
GABABRs are involved in alcohol intake and alcohol
motivational properties (reviewed in Colombo et al.
2004) and are hypothesized to play a role in the
development of substance dependences (reviewed in
Heinz 2002 and Koob & Volkow 2010).
Abnormalities in these neurotransmitter systems
determine changes in cortical excitability and can be
assessed
with
transcranial
magnetic
stimulation
(TMS) (reviewed in Nardone et al. 2012). TMS in com-
bination with electromyographic recording of motor-
evoked potentials (MEPs) has revealed alcohol-related
alterations in motor cortex excitability and plasticity
(Ziemann et al. 1995; Conte et al. 2008). Combining
TMS with electroencephalogram (EEG) enables non-
invasive, painless in vivo evaluation of the excitability
and effective connectivity of the human cortex, provid-
ing information different from that obtained using
other functional brain imaging modalities, such as
functional magnetic resonance imaging and positron
emission tomography. A network of neuronal connec-
tions is engaged when TMS-evoked activation extends
from a stimulation site to other parts of the brain
and the summation of synaptic potentials produces
deflections in scalp EEG signals. The characteristics of
these responses are thought to depend on the stimula-
tion intensity and functional state of the stimulated
cortex as well as the functional state of the whole
brain
(Ferreri
et
al.
2011,
2016).
It
has
been
suggested that the very first part of the TMS-evoked
EEG response reflects the reactivity—i.e. the functional
state—of the stimulated cortex. Thereafter, the spatio-
temporal distribution of TMS-evoked potentials (TEPs)
over the scalp reflects the spread of activation to other
cortical
areas
via
intrahemispheric
and
interhemi-
spheric
cortico-cortical
connections
and
subcortical
structures reflecting the effective connectivity of the
stimulated area (Ilmoniemi et al. 1997; Paus et al.
2001; and Chung et al. 2015). TEPs are therefore
considered to reflect the balance between inhibitory
and excitatory circuits and their impact in modulating
corto-subcortical
connectivity
(Ferreri
et
al.
2011,
2012). TEPs thus represent TMS-induced changes in
the excitation–inhibition balance of cortical circuits
and the spread of TMS-evoked activity to anatomically
interconnected cortical areas (Ilmoniemi et al. 1997;
Paus et al. 2001; and Chung et al. 2015).
Of particular interest in the use of TMS–EEG in
alcohol research are the findings of recent pharmaco-
TMS–EEG studies demonstrating that some of the
potentials that are evoked by motor cortex stimulation
are
GABAergic.
The
N45
potential
represents
the
activity of GABAARs containing α1-subunits, and the
N100 represents the activity of GABABRs (Premoli
et al. 2014). The acute effects of alcohol on cortical
activity
measured
using
TMS–EEG
have
previously
been studied. After acute alcohol ingestion, a decrease
in the N45 amplitude (Kähkönen et al. 2001) as well
as a near abolition of the N100 amplitude (Kähkönen
& Wilenius 2007) after motor cortex stimulation and
reduced prefrontal cortex excitability after prefrontal
cortex stimulation (Kähkönen et al. 2003) have been
observed. It was thus concluded that acute alcohol
use
may
change
motor
cortex
excitability
and/or
connectivity. So far, however, only one TMS–EEG study
has examined the effects of long-term alcohol use.
Reduced
cortical
inhibition
after
prefrontal
cortex
stimulation
in
the
post-detoxification
of
alcohol-
dependent
patients
was
reported,
suggesting
that
cortical hyper-excitability is associated with chronic
alcohol use (Naim-Feil et al. 2016).
There are no previous TMS–EEG studies on the effects
of long-term alcohol use on the young, developing brain.
The TEPs after motor cortex stimulation are well
characterized, reproducible and known to be related to
GABAergic
neurotransmission
(N45
and
N100).
Furthermore, the effects of acute alcohol ingestion on
these TEPs have already been published. Thus, we
decided to perform a motor cortex TMS–EEG study on
young adults with heavy long-term alcohol use.
We formed the following hypotheses:
1
ten years of alcohol use from adolescence to young
adulthood are associated with changes in cortical
excitability and connectivity, and
2
the alterations in cortical excitability are particularly
evident in the GABAergic TEPs N45 and N100.

 MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants
This study formed part of the ongoing Adolescents and
Alcohol project, aiming to provide information on the
maturation of the adolescent brain under the influence
of long-term heavy alcohol use among Finnish adoles-
cents. Ethical permission for the study was provided by
the Kuopio University Hospital Research Ethical Commit-
tee, the Finnish National Supervisory Authority for Wel-
fare and Health and the Finnish Ministry of Social
Affairs and Health. The experiments were carried out in
accordance with the latest version of the Helsinki decla-
ration, and all the participants provided written informed
consent. The baseline and follow-up study settings have
previously been described in detail elsewhere (Laukkanen
et al. 2009; Kaarre et al. 2015; Kekkonen et al. 2015).
Figure 1 illustrates the selection of the participants.
Participants of the original cohort (year of birth 1986–
1991) were recruited in 2004–2005 (time point 1). Ad-
olescents attending special needs education were ex-
cluded. All the participants completed a questionnaire
concerning their substance use, mental health and life-
style and undertook the Alcohol Use Disorders Identifica-
tion Test (AUDIT), a structured questionnaire originally
designed by the World Health Organization (Saunders
et al. 1993). A similar follow-up questionnaire was sent
in 2010–2011 (time point 2). The participants for the
present neuroimaging study (time point 3, n = 71) were
selected from those who completed the follow-up ques-
tionnaire. The selection was based on the AUDIT-C
scores; those with highest (subjects) and lowest (controls)
scores were chosen. The exclusion criteria were a history
of a head injury needing medical treatment, neurological
illness, severe mental disorder, metal or implanted devices
in
the
body
contraindicating
magnetic
resonance
imaging or TMS, regular use of other intoxicating
substances and pregnancy.
The enrolled participants were interviewed using a
semi-structured psychiatric interview (SCID: Structured
Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition; American Psychiatric
Association 1994). The participants also completed a
questionnaire concerning their lifetime drug use and
cigarette smoking.
Data on 55 participants were analysed in this part of
the study. Three participants (two subjects and one
control) were excluded from further analyses in the EEG
preprocessing
stage
because
of
prolonged
stimulus
artefacts. Thus, the final sample size was 52, comprising
27 subjects (11 men) with heavy long-term alcohol use
and 25 age-matched, gender-matched and education-
matched controls with little or no alcohol use (12 men).
The subjects had a self-reported history of 10 years of
heavy alcohol use observed at three time points, mea-
sured using a shortened version of the AUDIT. The
AUDIT-C (items 1–3; range 0–12) is composed of only
the first three questions concerning the level of alcohol
consumption during the previous year (for further infor-
mation, see Supporting Information Table S1).
The groups did not differ in neuropsychological func-
tioning, the number of lifetime psychiatric diagnoses or
current use of psychoactive medication (Kaarre et al.
2015, Table 1). During the experiments, the partici-
pants were not under the influence of alcohol and did
not have any withdrawal symptoms on the basis of the
observations of the interviewer. The SCID interviews
were conducted on the day before the TMS–EEG
measurements.
Transcranial magnetic stimulation
Transcranial magnetic stimulation was performed with
an eXimia stimulator (Nexstim Plc., Helsinki, Finland)
and a biphasic figure-of-eight coil combined with an
eXimia
navigation
system
that
enables
continuous
visualization of the stimulation site in relation to the
individual cortical anatomic structure (version 3.2.2).

During TMS, muscle activity was monitored online and
recorded by stimulus-locked electromyography (Nexstim
Plc., Helsinki, Finland).

 abductor pollicis brevis (APB) muscle was mapped around
the anatomical ‘hand knob’ (Yousry et al. 1997; Denslow
et al. 2005), by keeping the stimulating current perpen-
dicular to the central sulcus. The mapping was started
with 50 percent of the maximum stimulator output inten-
sity, but was adjusted according to the induced MEP am-
plitudes. The precentral gyrus and the sulci surrounding
it were stimulated to determine the optimal site from
which stimuli elicited MEPs of maximal amplitude in the
right APB muscle. At this optimal site, the coil was turned
within �90° to find the optimal current direction for stim-
ulations. This point with the optimal current direction
was set as the stimulation target. Next, the resting motor
threshold (rMT) was defined according to international
guidelines as the percentage of the maximum stimulator
output (%MSO) able to elicit reproducible MEPs (at least
50 μV in peak-to-peak amplitude) in five of 10 consecu-
tive stimuli (Rossini et al. 1994) in the APB muscle.
Transcranial magnetic stimulation–
Electroencephalogram recordings
During the TMS–EEG recording, the participants sat in an
adjustable chair with a headrest that ensured a stable
head position and were instructed to keep their eyes open
and to look at a fixation point on a screen in front of them
to minimize eye movements. TMS was focused to the pre-
viously mentioned stimulation target with the stimula-
tion intensity of 90 percent of the rMT. Each participant
underwent 150 TMS trials with 3–5 seconds randomized
interstimulus intervals. The TMS system delivered trigger
pulses that synchronized the TMS and EEG systems.
The TMS–EEG measurements were performed using a
TMS-compatible 64-channel EEG amplifier (BrainVision
Recorder ver 1.20, Brain Products GmbH, Gilching,
Germany), which enabled continuous data recording with-
out saturation of the EEG signals and did not require pin-
ning of the preamplifier output to a constant level during
TMS. In order to minimize overheating of the electrodes
by the stimulating coil, TMS-compatible Ag/AgCl-coated
electrodes were used. Skin/electrode impedance was set be-
low 5 kOhm, and the wires were rearranged before the
measurements so that there were no loops. To mask the
coil-generated clicks and to prevent click-induced auditory
evoked potentials in the EEG, a white noise (obtained from
the waveform of the TMS click), digitized and processed to
produce a continuous audio signal with specific time-
varying frequencies (Massimini et al. 2005), was continu-
ously delivered through earplugs. The masking volume
was adjusted until the subject reported that the TMS click
was no longer audible.
The EEG activity was continuously acquired from 61
scalp sites using electrodes positioned according to the
10–10 International System. Additional electrodes were
used as the ground and reference. The ground and refer-
ence electrodes were positioned on the forehead. Horizon-
tal and vertical eye movements were detected by
recording the electro-oculogram with two electrodes
located to the left and right of the external canthi.

 Natick, MA, USA) and the EEGLAB toolbox (Delorme &
Makeig 2004). EEG activity was visually inspected in each
channel, and trials contaminated by environmental
artefacts, muscle activity or eye movement were rejected.
In the preprocessing, TMS–EEG signals were bandpass
filtered at 1–80 Hz and downsampled from 5000 to
800 Hz. When needed, 50-Hz notch filtering was also
applied. The data were segmented into epochs of 100-
millisecond prestimulus to 600-millisecond poststimulus.
The first 15 milliseconds of the post-TMS–EEG signal was
zero padded in order to avoid the stimulus artefact.
Furthermore, the data were baseline corrected.
The TMS-evoked EEG activity was analysed in the
time domain. First, the global mean field power (GMFP),
which is a measure of global brain activation calculated
as the root mean-squared value of the EEG signal ampli-
tude across all electrodes, was calculated to identify dif-
ferences in TMS-evoked activity between the groups.
Then, in each subject and each electrode, semi-automatic
amplitude and latency measurement for each of the TEPs
of interested was carried out. Baseline to peak measure-
ments was used for amplitude measurements. The laten-
cies for TEPs were measured from the TMS pulse to the
time point of the TEP peak. When defining TEPs, the
P30 was analysed as the greatest positivity between 20
and 40 milliseconds, the N45 as the greatest negative
amplitude between 35 and 60 milliseconds, the P60 as
the greatest positivity between 50 and 90 milliseconds,
the N100 as the greatest negativity between 75 and
150 milliseconds and the P180 as the largest positivity
between 160 and 200 milliseconds.
Statistical analysis
Chi-squared tests were run to compare groups on the
basis
of
demographic
variables
including
gender,
educational background, the prevalence of lifetime and
current psychiatric diagnoses and the prevalence of
smoking, marijuana and other drug use. The group
difference in mean AUDIT-C scores was analysed with
the Mann–Whitney U-test.
In
statistical
analysis,
the
differences
in
GMFP
between the subjects and controls were tested by
performing an independent t-test at each time point. In
the TMS–EEG analysis, a linear mixed model was used.
When exploring the topography of TEP peaks, data from
nine frontal channels, nine central channels and nine
parieto-occipital channels (27 channels altogether) were
analysed. The channels were divided into nine regions
(see Fig. 2 for further details). For the analysis, we created
variables to define the region of the EEG signal: three in
an anteroposterior (AP) direction (1–3) and three
mediolaterally (ML; 1–3). Before the mixed model analy-
sis was performed, the data were restructured so that the
information from all the channels of interest was brought
under one variable, named as the amplitude of peak of
interest. Then, the amplitude was entered into the mixed
linear model as a dependent variable. The study number
of the participant was determined as a random factor and
the group, AP and ML, as fixed factors; all two-way and
all three-way interactions of the three latter were also
examined.
Post hoc analysis was performed to determine the
statistically significant interaction factors, i.e. regions in
which the differences between or within groups existed.
Before the post hoc analysis, two variables, the group
(subject/control) and the AP direction (1, 2 or 3), were
combined into one variable, GROUP_AP
. This variable
was then used as a factor in the mixed linear model, in
which the laterality (ML) and the study number of the
participants were other factors and the peak of interest
the dependent variable.
The TEP latencies were measured in the areas in
which the respective TEP amplitudes were observed at
their largest: the P30 central ipsilateral, the N45
frontocentral, the N100 central ipsilateral, the P60 in
the centroparietal region and the P180 central bilateral.
The previous literature supports our regional latency
analysis (Ferreri et al. 2011). In statistical analysis, the
same principles as in the TEP amplitude analysis were
used: the data were restructured and, in the linear mixed
model, the latency was set as a dependent variable, the
participantˈs study number was a random factor and
the group was the factor for fixed effects analysis.

 Finally, Pearson correlation analysis between signifi-
cant TEP findings and AUDIT-C scores was conducted.
All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 22.0
(IBM, Somers, NY, USA). The level of significance was
set at P < 0.05 (two-tailed). The data were considered
normally distributed when the skewness and kurtosis
were between �1 and +1. All reported P values are
Bonferroni corrected for multiple comparisons.
RESULTS
The AUDIT-C scores of the subjects were above 6 and the
controlˈs scores below 2 at every time point. No current
alcohol use disorders were diagnosed in any of the
subjects. The AUDIT-C scores are presented in Table 1.
In practice, one scores 6 in the AUDIT-C by, e.g. drinking
five bottles of beer (330 ml/bottle) more than four times
per week, and two by drinking one–two drinks two–four
times per month. No significant differences were found
in the rMT between the groups (41 � 6%MSO in the
subjects and 42 � 7%MSO in the controls). Smoking was
significantly more common among subjects, but there were
no significant differences in the prevalence of current
depression or lifetime cannabis or other drug use (Table 1).
The TMS-evoked EEG activity lasted at least up to
300 milliseconds in both groups. Total EEG activity,
assessed using GMFP
, was significantly elevated in the
group of alcohol users compared with the controls in the
time window 54 to 75 milliseconds (P < 0.05) (Fig. 3).
In both groups, TMS elicited typical TEP components
(P30, N45, P60, N100 and P180) as previously described
(Fig. 4a & b). No epileptiform activity was detected.
The transcranial magnetic stimulation-evoked potential
amplitudes
The TEP amplitudes, amplitude distribution and statisti-
cal significance are presented in Table 2 and Fig. 5. The
N45 amplitude was significantly larger (P = 0.045) in
subjects compared with controls. Furthermore, a signifi-
cant group*AP interaction was found (P < 0.001). The
between-group
difference
was
maximal
frontally
(P < 0.001). In subjects, the N45 amplitude was largest
frontally, whereas in controls, the maximum N45 ampli-
tude was located centrally. In controls, the N45 ampli-
tude was significantly smaller parieto-occipitally when
compared with the frontal or central areas (P < 0.001).
The mean P60 amplitude did not differ between the
groups. However, the group*AP interaction was signifi-
cant (P < 0.001). The group difference was seen
parieto-occipitally as a trend (P = 0.054) after correction
for multiple comparisons. In subjects, the P60 amplitude
in the parieto-occipital area was significantly larger than
frontal and central amplitudes (P < 0.001). In controls,
the largest amplitude was observed frontally and was sig-
nificantly larger than central and parieto-occipital ampli-
tudes (P < 0.001).
In the N100 amplitude, group*AP interaction was
also observed (P = 0.025). Although no significant
between-group differences were found regionally in the
post hoc analysis, the topographical distribution of the
component differed between the groups (Table 2). In
both groups, the N100 amplitude was at its largest cen-
trally. However, in subjects, the amplitude was larger
frontally than parieto-occipitally, whereas in controls,
the mean frontal amplitude was smaller than the
parieto-occipital mean amplitude. There were no statis-
tically significant differences in the P30 or P180 ampli-
tude between the groups.
Correlation between frontal N45 amplitude and Alcohol
Use Disorders Identification Test–Consumption scores
The AUDIT-C scores correlated significantly with the
frontal N45 amplitude analysed as the mean of the nine
frontal channels (r = �0.317, P = 0.022; Fig. 6).
The transcranial magnetic stimulation-evoked potential
latencies
There were no significant differences between the groups
in the P30, N45, P60, N100 or P180 latencies (Table 2).
DISCUSSION
Summary of the main findings
To our best knowledge, this is the first TMS–EEG study
exploring the effects of alcohol use in adolescence.
Heavy drinking in adolescence was found to associate
with altered cortical functioning in young adulthood and

The topography of the P60 and N100 components
differed between the groups.
These results are in line with previous EEG studies in
which alcohol-associated differences have been found in
adolescent and young adult binge drinkers (reviewed in
Jacobus & Tapert 2013, Ehlers et al. 2007, Koskinen
et al. 2011) and provide new information on the associa-
tions between GABA metabolism and alcohol use in
adolescence.
Heavy drinking in adolescence is associated with altered
cortical excitability
Earlier, altered cortical excitability has been observed
among those with chronic alcoholism. Our results are
in line with these findings, although our subjects had
only a short history of heavy drinking and none of them
met the criteria for alcohol dependence. GMFP
, an indica-
tor of global cortical excitability, was significantly larger
in subjects in the time window 54–75 milliseconds after
the TMS pulse. Previous animal studies have demon-
strated that chronic alcohol use enhances excitatory
NMDA signalling and depresses GABA signalling, induc-
ing downregulation of GABAARs and adaptation of
GABAAR-mediated inhibition. This, in turn, increases
the excitability of the nervous system (reviewed in Liang
& Olsen 2014). Similarly, in a rodent study, chronic expo-
sure to ethanol led to increased intrinsic excitability and
glutamatergic synaptic signalling of lateral orbitofrontal
cortex neurons (Nimitvilai et al. 2016).
In previous EEG studies, increased power in the beta
frequency band has been found in alcoholics, manifesting
hyper-excitability or central nervous system disinhibition.
This appears to have a genetic link and an association
with GABRA2, a receptor gene for GABAA (Edenberg
et al. 2004, reviewed in Kamarajan & Porjesz 2015).
GABAA has been suggested to act as a pacemaker in beta
rhythm, which is attributed to a balance between net-
works of excitatory pyramidal cells and inhibitory inter-
neurons (reviewed in Kamarajan & Porjesz 2015).
Interestingly, in a TMS study, it was suggested that even
those with high risk for alcohol dependence have
impairments in corticortical and transcallosal inhibitory
mechanisms, resulting in central nervous system hyper-
excitability (Muralidharan et al. 2008).
Naim-Feil et al. (2016) also found disrupted cortical
excitability and reduced cortical inhibition in their pre-
frontal cortex stimulation TMS–EEG study. Our results
are in line with these findings, although the aforemen-
tioned measurements were conducted on adults with
an over 10-year history of alcohol dependence during
the post-detoxification and a different study paradigm
was used.
Heavy drinking in adolescence is associated with changes
in GABAAergic functioning
The TMS focused on the motor cortex elicits a well-
characterized sequence of positive and negative deflec-
tions in the EEG usually labelled after their latency and
polarity, e.g. P30, N45, P60, N100 and P180. These TEPs
have been demonstrated to be highly reproducible
(Lioumis et al. 2009; Ferreri et al. 2011). Thus, alterations
in the TEPs provide information on cortical functioning.
The origin of the N45 after left M1 stimulation has been
suggested to be in the left central sulcus, and in topo-
graphical surface maps, the N45 is maximal in contralat-
eral frontal regions after motor cortex stimulation
(Premoli et al. 2014). One of our findings was an increase
in the TMS-evoked N45 amplitude in heavy drinkers.
The generation of this TEP is connected to GABA re-
ceptor activity. In the 1980s, Connors et al. found in their
animal studies that electrical cortical stimulation evoked
a brief excitation period lasting up to 50 milliseconds and
two inhibitory periods. The first phase is linked to the ac-
tivation of GABAARs and the two latter phases to the ac-
tivation of GABABRs (Connors et al. 1988; Premoli et al.
2014). The firing of cortical neurons enveloped in the
EEG signal is associated with the activation of fast and
slow excitatory postsynaptic potentials and fast and slow
inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (Rosenthal et al. 1967).
The excitatory postsynaptic potentials are mediated by
postsynaptic GABAARs and are possibly involved in the
generation and/or modulation of early TEPs, including
N45 (Ferreri et al. 2011). Slow inhibitory postsynaptic
potentials are related to presynaptic and postsynaptic
GABABRs and presumably involved in the later TEPS in-
cluding P60, N100 and P180 (Ferreri et al. 2011).
Premoli et al. (2014) discovered an increase in the
N45 amplitude associated with the ingestion of positive
GABAAR modulators (alprazolam, zolpidem and diaze-
pam). Because all the aforementioned drugs target the
alpha-subunit of the GABAARs, the study findings sug-
gest that activation of the alpha-subunit-containing
GABAARs participates in the generation of the N45
(Premoli
et
al.
2014).
Considering
the
known
GABAergicy of the N45, our results suggest altered corti-
cal activity and GABAAergic neurotransmission associ-
ated with long-term alcohol use in adolescence. The
differences between groups were most prominent fron-
tally, which are in line with the hypothesis that the pre-
frontal cortex, developing later than other regions, may
be especially vulnerable to the harmful effects of alcohol
(Arain et al. 2013, reviewed in Bava & Tapert 2010 and
Hermens et al. 2013).
Compared with earlier TMS–EEG studies, these find-
ings suggest that the chronic effects of alcohol on cortical
functioning are reciprocal to the acute effects. Acute

 effects of alcohol have manifested as a decrease in TEP
amplitudes in TMS–EEG studies, in both the N45
(Kähkönen et al. 2001) and N100 (Kähkönen & Wilenius
2007). These findings are suggested to represent an
alcohol-induced increase in neural inhibition (Kähkönen
et al. 2001; Kähkönen & Wilenius 2007).
Heavy drinking in adolescence and changes in
intracortical connectivity
Effective GABAB transmission has been associated with
addiction, because the activation of GABABR has been
identified
as
an
anti-addictive
therapeutic
strategy
(reviewed in Roberts 2005, Vlachou & Markou 2010
and Filip et al. 2015). GABABR agonists and positive allo-
steric modulators block the reinforcing effects of addictive
substances (reviewed in Vlachou & Markou 2010). Both
the P60 and N100 amplitudes have been related to
GABABR activation (Ferreri et al. 2011; Premoli et al.
2014). We found no alterations in the P60 and N100
amplitudes in heavy drinkers. However, topographical dif-
ferences were discovered in both waves, suggesting
changes in cortical connectivity.
Little is known about the source structure of the P60
peak. By studying the cortical correlate of short afferent
inhibition in healthy subjects, it has been posited that this
wave could be a hallmark of sensorimotor interaction
(Ferreri et al. 2012).
The N100, a dominant peak in TMS-evoked EEG ac-
tivity (Nikulin et al. 2003; Bender et al. 2005), has been
related to GABABergic inhibition (Ferreri et al. 2011,
Premoli et al. 2014, Farzan et al. 2013, Bonnard et al.
2009, Nikulin et al. 2003, Bender et al. 2005, Kičić
et al. 2008) and to the activity of the cortico–striato–
thalamo–cortical
loops
and/or
long-range
cortico-
cortical connections, such as the callosal fibres (Ferrarelli
et al. 2010; Premoli et al. 2014). Premoli et al. (2014) dis-
covered that the benzodiazepines alprazolam and diaze-
pam reduced the N100 amplitude, suggesting that
GABABR activation is involved in the manifestation of
this peak (Premoli et al. 2014).
Strong evidence from experimental and theoretical
studies suggests that GABA levels are strictly correlated
with the strength of functional short-range connectivity
within several major cortical networks, such as the mo-
tor one (reviewed in Ferreri & Rossini 2013), as well as
long-range connectivity between segregated and distant
networks
(Stagg
et
al.
2014).
Therefore,
altered
GABAAergic neurotransmission in local inhibitory net-
works could determine the altered cortical excitability
and/or disrupted propagation of later TEPs from the stim-
ulated area. In this respect, we found both increased cor-
tical excitability, as evaluated by the GMFP
, and a clear
modulation of the topography of later EEG components,
i.e. P60 and N100. This difference in the topography of
specific TEPs just subsequent to the N45 suggests
alcohol-related
differences
in
cortico-cortical/cortico-
subcortical connectivity/activation patterns, possibly sec-
ondary to the modulated GABAAergic activity.
Alcohol-associated impairments in functional connec-
tivity were found in a recent resting-state EEG study on
women with alcohol use disorder (Herrera-Diaz et al.
2016). In another EEG study, acute alcohol use increased
large-scale connectivity in the resting-state network,
which was suggested to be linked to increased GABA
transmission (Lithari et al. 2012). In a recent functional
magnetic resonance imaging functional connectivity
density mapping study, reduced connectivity in thala-
mus, visual cortex, prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate
and precuneus was found in heavy alcohol-using adults
when compared with controls, whereas the heavy
drinkers had higher connectivity in cerebellum (Shokri-
Kojori et al. 2016). Substance use in adolescence is asso-
ciated with poorer white matter integrity in association,
projection and interhemispheric white matter tracts
(Bava et al. 2013; Jacobus et al. 2013a; Jacobus et al.
2013b), which may contribute to changes in connectiv-
ity. However, it remains unclear whether the alterations
in connectivity in our subjects were based on structural
or functional changes.
The question of causality; underlying, predisposing
vulnerabilities
In Event-Related Potential studies, it has been suggested
that a reduction in the P3 amplitude is not only associ-
ated with adolescent alcohol use but also heritable and
may independently indicate a genetic predisposition for
alcoholism (Perlman et al. 2009). An increase in EEG
beta power has been found not only in alcohol-dependent
subjects but also in the offspring of male alcoholics
(Rangaswamy et al. 2004). Variations in GABAA receptor
genes influence neural excitability and may predispose to
the development of alcohol dependence (reviewed in
Kamarajan & Porjesz 2015). It has been hypothesized
that the GABAARs containing the alpha-2 subunit con-
tribute to the genetic risk for alcohol dependence
(reviewed in Liang & Olsen 2014).
Other underlying, premorbid differences in brain
structure and function have also been noted in adoles-
cents with a family history of alcoholism. These predis-
posing
factors
for
alcohol
use
disorders
include
differences in the volume of the amygdala, hippocampus,
basal ganglia and cerebellum and in white matter integ-
rity. Changes in executive functioning have also been dis-
covered, such as altered inhibitory control and the
working-memory-related brain response in functional
magnetic resonance studies (Cservenka 2016).

 Strengths and limitations
The strength of this study is the large sample size in the
context of previous TMS studies. Furthermore, there were
no differences in demographic characteristics, psychiatric
morbidity, use of psychoactive medication or cognitive
functioning between the groups (Kaarre et al. 2015).
The study subjects had high AUDIT-C scores at all three
time points, indicating long-term alcohol use. Our partic-
ipants were not under the influence of alcohol during the
measurements and did not have any withdrawal symp-
toms. They had not used any other substances than alco-
hol. This would justify us to conclude that our TMS–EEG
findings are based on neither the acute effects nor the
withdrawal symptoms of alcohol, and the altered cortical
activity could be a permanent state, associated with long-
term alcohol use and possibly related to an alcohol-
induced delay or alterations in brain development.
The main limitation of this study is the absence of
baseline data prior to the onset of alcohol use. Thus, it re-
mains unclear whether the altered cortical activity is a
consequence of long-term alcohol use or a predisposing
factor adding to the risk of heavy alcohol use. There
might also be underlying genetic vulnerabilities and fac-
tors influencing the effects of alcohol on electrophysiolog-
ical responses (Koskinen et al. 2011).
Other potential limitations are stimulus artefacts and
the challenges in TMS–EEG signal processing. We report
novel findings within the first 50 milliseconds, which is a
time window that is sometimes disregarded because of
the possibility of stimulus artefact affecting the results.
There are no standardized methods for TMS–EEG process-
ing. In our study, ICA or comparable artefact removal ap-
proaches were not applied. Instead, as presented in the
methods section, we have done other, equally acceptable
approaches during the measurements and the EEG prepro-
cessing to ensure the reliability of the data. These proce-
dures are in accordance with the recent recommendations
(e.g. Siebner et al. 2009; Sekiguchi et al. 2011).
Future implications
The question of causality, determining whether the differ-
ences in cortical functioning are a cause or a consequence
of alcohol use in adolescence, challenges future research.
More research is needed into the possible predisposing dif-
ferences in neurophysiological functioning, potentially
adding vulnerability to alcohol-induced changes.
The associations of GABA metabolism with cortical ac-
tivity should also be further explored. The acute effects of
alcohol on TMS–EEG findings in chronic alcohol users are
still unknown. Even though our participants performed
equally well in the neuropsychological tests, and no alco-
hol use disorders were diagnosed, changes in cortical
functioning were found. This means that even alcohol
use that does not meet the present diagnostic criteria is as-
sociated with alterations in neurophysiological function-
ing. It can be speculated whether the diagnostic criteria
for alcohol use disorders are too strict among adolescents
and young adults. On the other hand, if the difference in
cortical functioning is a predisposing factor, it suggests
that more effort should be put into the prevention and
early detection of adolescent alcohol use, because predis-
posing factors leave adolescents and young adults at
greater risk of dependence and health problems.
