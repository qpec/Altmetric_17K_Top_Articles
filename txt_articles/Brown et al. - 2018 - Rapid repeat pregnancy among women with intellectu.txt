apid repeat pregnancy within 12 months of a live birth is 
associated with adverse perinatal outcomes, with previ-
ous meta-analyses showing increased risks for stillbirth 
(adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.35, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.07–
1.71), fetal growth restriction (adjusted OR 1.26, 95% CI 1.18–
1.33), preterm birth (adjusted OR 1.40, 95% CI 1.24–2.58) and 
early neonatal mortality (adjusted OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.02–1.64).1,2 
There is debate about whether these risks are due to inadequate 
recovery from the prior pregnancy, including depleted maternal 
nutrient stores, or confounding by other factors such as socio-
economic status.2 Nevertheless, high rates of rapid repeat preg-
nancy in North America, as well as research showing that as many 
as 55% of such pregnancies are unintended,3 make prevention of 
rapid repeat pregnancy a public health priority. Adolescents and 
women with low education or income have been shown to be at 
high risk for rapid repeat pregnancy4–6 and have been the focus of 
public health efforts.3 Women with intellectual and develop-
mental disabilities, who exhibit some of the same risk factors for 
rapid repeat pregnancy, such as suboptimal access to contracep-
tion and other family planning services,7 have yet to be studied.
Intellectual and developmental disabilities affect 1 in every 
100 adults8 and are characterized by cognitive limitations and diffi-
culties with conceptual, social and practical skills.9 Examples of 
such disabilities include autism, fetal alcohol spectrum disorder 
and trisomy 21, but most are nonspecific diagnoses associated with 
mild intellectual impairment.9 Sterilization and long-term admis-
sion to an institution have historically limited child-bearing in this 
population.10 However, these practices are now uncommon,11 such 
that young women with and without intellectual and developmen-
tal disabilities have similar fertility rates.12,13 Given stigma and other 
barriers to education and employment, as well as the financial bur-
den associated with disability, women with intellectual and 
de 
velopmental disabilities are more likely than their peers to live in 
poverty. Poverty, combined with inadequate access to health care 
and poor social support, has further downstream effects in this 
population, including elevated rates of medical and psychiatric

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND: Rapid repeat pregnancy 
within 12 months of a live birth is associ-
ated with adverse perinatal outcomes. 
We evaluated the risk for rapid repeat 
pregnancy among women with intellec-
tual and developmental disabilities, with 
whom sharing of information about 
pregnancy planning and contraception 
may be inadequate.
METHODS: We accessed population-
based health administrative data for all 
women with an index live birth in Ontario, 
Canada, for the period 2002–2013. We 
used modified Poisson regression to com-
pare relative risks (RRs) for a rapid repeat 
pregnancy within 12 months of the index 
live birth in women with and without 
intellectual and developmental disabil-
ities, first adjusting for demographic fac-
tors and then additionally adjusting for 
social, health and health care disparities.
RESULTS: We compared 2855 women 
with intellectual and developmental dis-
abilities and 923 367 women without 
such disabilities. At the index live birth, 
women with intellectual and develop-
mental disabilities were more likely to be 
younger than 25 years of age (46.8% v. 
18.2%) and to be disadvantaged on each 
meas 
ure of social, health and health care 
disparities. These women had a higher 
rate of rapid repeat pregnancy than 
those without such disabilities (7.6% v. 
3.9%; adjusted RR 1.34, 95% confidence 
interval [CI] 1.18–1.54, after controlling 
for demographic factors). This risk was 
attenuated upon further adjustment for 
social, health and health care disparities 
(adjusted RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.87–1.14).
INTERPRETATION: Rapid repeat preg-
nancy, which was more common among 
women with intellectual and develop-
mental disabilities, may be explained by 
social, health and health care dispar-
ities. To optimize reproductive health, 
multifactorial approaches to address 
the marginalization experienced by this 
population are likely needed.

comorbidities.14–17 According to these markers of disadvantage, it is 
plausible that women with intellectual and developmental disabil-
ities may be at increased risk for rapid repeat pregnancy. We com-
pared the risk of rapid repeat pregnancy among women with and 
without intellectual and developmental disabilities.
Methods
Study design and setting
We undertook a population-based cohort study in Ontario, Can-
ada, where health care is provided at no direct cost to residents. 
The cohort comprised women who had a live birth between 
Apr. 1, 2002, and Mar. 31, 2013, who were followed for 12 months 
to ascertain the primary outcome. 
Data sources 
We accessed and analyzed multiple databases at the Institute for 
Clinical Evaluative Sciences. Using a unique encoded identifier, 
person-level sociodemographic and health data were linked 
deterministically; social services data were linked probabilis-
tically with these data, on the basis of name, birth date, sex and 
postal code.18 We extracted data from the Registered Persons 
Database (birth date, postal code, date of death), the Ontario 
Health Insurance Plan database (physician billing data), the 
National Ambulatory Care Reporting System (data on emergency 
department visits), the Canadian Institute for Health Information 
Discharge Abstract Database (medical and psychiatric hospital 
admission data), the Ontario Mental Health Reporting System 
(psychiatric hospital admission data), the Ontario Drug Benefits 
database (publicly funded drug benefit data) and the Ontario 
Ministry of Community and Social Services, now the Ministry of 
Children, Community and Social Services (Ontario Disability Sup-
port Program data).18 These databases are valid for sociodemo-
graphic data, primary diagnoses and physician billing claims.19
Exposure
We derived our sample from a cohort of Ontarian adults with and 
without intellectual and developmental disabilities who were 18 to 
64 years of age as of Apr. 1, 2009.20 We classified individuals as hav-
ing intellectual and developmental disabilities if they had a rele-
vant diagnosis recorded for at least 1 hospital admission or emer-
gency department visit or at least 2 outpatient physician visits, 
recorded since database inception or listed as the reason for 
receipt of Ontario Disability Support Program payments. This def-
inition was based on Ontario legislation21 and clinical practice8 and 
includes intellectual disability, genetic conditions resulting in intel-
lectual disability (e.g., trisomy 21) and developmental disabilities 
(e.g., autism).18 The resulting prevalence of intellectual and 
develop 
mental disabilities in Ontarian adults (0.8%)20 is consistent 
with international meta-analyses.8 From this cohort, we identified 
women with and without intellectual and developmental disabil-
ities aged 18 to 49 years who had a live birth at gestational age of at 
least 20 weeks between Apr. 1, 2002, and Mar. 31, 2013. The first live 
birth in the study period was identified using MOMBABY, a linked 
maternal–newborn data set, derived from the Discharge Abstract 
Database, which identifies more than 98.0% of Ontario births.22
Outcome
Rapid repeat pregnancy is variously defined in the literature as a 
“birth to conception” or “birth to birth” interval of less than 12, 18 or 
24 months.1–6 In our study, gestational age and therefore conception 
date, calculated by subtracting gestational age from the delivery 
date, was not available for pregnancy losses (miscarriages at < 20 wk 
and stillbirths at ≥ 20 wk gestation) or induced abortions. As such, we 
could not identify pregnancies conceived but not ending in the 
follow-up period. We therefore defined rapid repeat pregnancy as a 
live birth, pregnancy loss or induced abortion occurring within 
12 months of the index live birth, as recorded in MOMBABY 
(Appendix 1, available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/
cmaj.170932/-/DC1). Ascertainment of live births, stillbirths and 
induced abortions is complete and accurate,22,23 but some early mis-
carriages may have been missed. To avoid misclassification of com-
plications from the index live birth as a rapid repeat pregnancy, such 
as misclassifying dilatation and curettage for retained products of 
conception as a subsequent induced abortion, we started counting 
rapid repeat pregnancies at 3 months after the index live birth. In 
additional analyses, we tested less specific definitions of rapid repeat 
pregnancy within 18 and 24 months of the index live birth.
Covariables
We measured the following covariables as of the date of the index 
live birth: age, parity, rural residence, neighbourhood income quin-
tile, social assistance, chronic medical conditions, mental illness and 
continuity of primary care. We measured rural residence and neigh-
bourhood income quintile by linking maternal residential postal 
code with census information; rural communities were those with 
fewer than 10 000 residents.24 We measured social assistance using 
Ontario Drug Benefit eligibility as a proxy, because most individuals 
younger than 65 years of age with these benefits also receive social 
assistance.25 We measured chronic medical conditions using col-
lapsed ambulatory diagnostic groups from the Johns Hopkins Clin-
ical Groups System.26 Mental illness comprised psychotic27 and non-
psychotic mental illness and substance use disorders. We measured 
continuity of primary care using the Usual Provider Continuity Index, 
which is calculated as the proportion of visits made to the usual pri-
mary care provider, for example, the family physician, divided by the 
total number of visits to all primary care providers in the 2 years 
before the index live birth.28
Statistical analysis
We described baseline characteristics using frequencies and per-
centages, and we used standardized differences to compare women 
with and without intellectual and developmental disabilities.29 We 
used modified Poisson regression to directly estimate the relative 
risk (RR) and 95% CI of rapid repeat pregnancy by 12 months.30 We 
produced 2 adjusted models: model 1 was adjusted for the demo-
graphic characteristics of age, parity and rurality. Model 2 also had 
adjustment for the following social, health and health care dispar-
ities that might explain the impact of disability status on rapid 
repeat pregnancy risk: neighbourhood income quintile, social assis-
tance, chronic medical conditions, mental illness and continuity of 
primary care.14–17 We described the rate of rapid repeat pregnancy in 
each month of follow-up using cumulative incidence. Finally, we

E951
described frequencies and percentages of rapid repeat pregnancies 
ending in live birth, pregnancy loss or induced abortion.
We conducted several additional analyses. First, to model 2, we 
added interaction terms between disability status and factors 
expected to directly affect rapid repeat pregnancy risk:4–6 age 
(< 25 yr v. ≥ 25 yr), neighbourhood income (quintiles 1–2 v. 3–5), 
social assistance (receiving v. not receiving), mental illness (any 
mental illness or substance use disorder v. none) and continuity of 
primary care (infrequent use or low continuity v. moderate or high 
continuity). We then stratified model 2 on these variables. Second, 
because the risk of unintended pregnancy in high-risk groups 
increases with the number of prior pregnancies,1 we re-ran analyses 
in primiparas. Finally, we re-ran analyses defining rapid repeat preg-
nancy as occurring within 18 and 24 months of the index live birth.

and developmental disabilities were more likely than those without 
to be younger than 25 years of age (46.8% v. 18.2%); to live in rural 
areas (14.0% v. 9.5%) or neighbourhoods in the 2 lowest income 
quintiles (60.6% v. 41.1%); to receive social assistance (39.4% v. 
3.7%); to have stable (36.4% v. 27.3%) and unstable (21.1% v. 
13.2%) chronic medical conditions, psychotic (3.8% v. 0.2%) and 
nonpsychotic (50.0% v. 27.4%) mental illness, and substance use 
disorders (8.5% v. 2.1%); and to have low continuity of primary care 
(27.8% v. 21.1%) (Table 1). 
Rapid repeat pregnancy within 12 months of the index live birth 
occurred in 216 (7.6%) of the 2855 women with intellectual and 
developmental disabilities and 35 948 (3.9%) of the 923 367 women 
without such disabilities. This risk remained elevated after adjust-
ment for demographic factors (adjusted RR 1.34, 95% CI 1.18–1.54) 
but was attenuated after further adjustment for social, health and 
health care disparities (adjusted RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.87–1.14). Cumu-
lative incidence curves showed that rapid repeat pregnancies 
tended to occur slightly closer to the index live birth for women 
with intellectual and developmental disabilities than for women 
without such disabilities (Figure 1). Among women with intellectual 
and developmental disabilities, rapid repeat pregnancy most often 
ended in induced abortion (106 [49.1%]), followed by live birth 
(72 [33.3%]) and pregnancy loss (38 [17.6%]), whereas among 
women without such disabilities, pregnancies most often ended in 
induced abortion (21 245 [59.1%]), followed by pregnancy loss 
(7765 [21.6%]) and live birth (6938 [19.3%]) (p < 0.001). 
Interaction terms between disability status and neighbour-
hood income (p = 0.01) and receipt of social assistance (p = 0.004) 
were statistically significant. Stratified analyses suggested that 
the impact of disability status was weakest for women living in 
lower-income neighbourhoods and those receiving social assis-
tance. All other interaction terms were nonsignificant (Figure 2).
Primiparas with intellectual and developmental disabilities, 
relative to those without such disabilities, were at increased risk 
for rapid repeat pregnancy after adjustment for demographic 
characteristics (adjusted RR 1.28, 95% CI 1.09–1.50), but not after 
additional adjustment for social, health and health care dispar-
ities (adjusted RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.84–1.16) (Appendix 2, available 
at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.170932/-/DC1).
When the outcome window was extended to 18 or 24 months, 
women with intellectual and developmental disabilities, relative 
to those without such disabilities, were at increased risk for rapid 
repeat pregnancy after adjustment for demographic characteris-
tics (18 mo, adjusted RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.22–1.45; 24 mo, adjusted 
RR 1.16, 95% CI 1.08–1.24) (Appendices 3 and 4, available at www.
cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.170932/-/DC1). After fur-
ther adjustment for social, health and health care disparities, the 
risk at 18 months remained statistically significant (adjusted RR 
1.10, 95% CI 1.01–1.20), whereas the risk at 24 months did not 
(adjusted RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.99–1.14).
Other variables independently associated with rapid repeat 
pregnancy were age younger than 25 years (adjusted RR 2.75, 95% 
CI 2.69–2.82), multiparity (adjusted RR 1.22, 95% CI 1.19–1.26), 
urban residence (adjusted RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.30–1.40), low neigh-
bourhood income (adjusted RR 1.46, 95% CI 1.43–1.49), receipt of 
social assistance (adjusted RR 1.71, 95% CI 1.65–1.77), mental illness 
or substance use disorder (adjusted RR 1.13, 95% CI 1.11–1.16), and 
infrequent use or low continuity of primary care (adjusted RR 1.16, 
95% CI 1.14–1.19) (Table 2). Appendix 5 (available at www.cmaj.ca/
lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.170932/-/DC1) shows the individual 
impacts of covariables on the unadjusted association between dis-
ability status and rapid repeat pregnancy. In all models, receipt of 
social assistance had the greatest impact, followed by age younger 
than 25 years and low neighbourhood income.

Interpretation
Women with intellectual and developmental disabilities, relative 
to those without such disabilities, were at increased risk for rapid 
repeat pregnancy within 12 months of a live birth before we 
accounted for the reasons for this increased risk. However, this 
risk was clearly attenuated after adjustment for social, health 
and health care disparities. Attenuation of the impact of disabil-
ity on rapid repeat pregnancy risk was also greatest in high-risk 
groups defined by lower income and receipt of social assistance. 
The results were similar among primiparas and when broader 
definitions of rapid repeat pregnancy were used. 
We hypothesized that women with intellectual and develop-
mental disabilities would have higher rates of rapid repeat preg-
nancy than those without such disabilities because of, in part, 
their social, health and health care disparities.14–17 Compared

with women with better resources, those who have low income, 
for example, tend to be less well equipped to advocate with their 
respective partners for consistent use of contraception and 
appropriate interpregnancy intervals; they may also have poorer 
access to effective family planning services.4–6 Given that women 
with intellectual and developmental disabilities are more likely 
than their peers to experience marginalization in the form of pov-
erty, isolation, and medical or mental illness,14–17 it is not surpris-
ing that their risk for rapid repeat pregnancy was elevated in the 
unadjusted analyses. Notably, the importance of low income and 
social assistance in the adjusted and stratified analyses supports 
the idea that social vulnerability — whether at an individual or 
system level — explains the impact of disability status on risk of 
rapid repeat pregnancy.

Our findings build on the only related study, a nested case–
control study using the US National Longitudinal Survey of 
Youth,31 which found that low cognitive ability was related to 
rapid repeat pregnancy within 24 months among 18-year-old 
women. However, that study focused on adolescents and meas-
ured cognitive ability in terms of limitations in language and 
arithmetic skills, which may not reflect intellectual and develop-
mental disabilities per se. Furthermore, the authors controlled 
only for age at first sexual encounter, sexual health education, 
education level and poverty, which left open the possibility that 
the impact of cognitive ability could be explained by other mark-
ers of marginalization. The results of our current study add to the 
literature by suggesting that the rate of rapid repeat pregnancy is 
higher among women with intellectual and developmental dis-
abilities specifically and that a combination of social, health and 
health care disparities could explain this risk.
Rapid repeat pregnancy frequently reflects vulnerability in a 
woman’s ability to make informed reproductive decisions32 and 
lack of access to family planning services.2,33 Our data signal the 
need to address systemic vulnerabilities in marginalized groups 
to improve reproductive outcomes. Given that women are more 
connected to the health care system around the time of delivery, 
the perinatal period may be an ideal time to intervene.34,35
Limitations
Some women with intellectual and developmental disabilities 
may have been misclassified if they did not have a health care 
encounter in which their disability was recorded and were not 
recipients of assistance through the Ontario Disability Support 
Program. The disability definition included conditions with vari-
ability in functioning.9 Although there could be heterogeneity in 
risk associated with these characteristics, we retained a defin-
ition with policy21 and clinical9 relevance. Furthermore, because 
our cohort was restricted to women with a prior live birth, cap-
tured disabilities were likely fairly homogeneous, with mild to 
moderate severity.36
Our outcome also had limitations. Because we had no data on 
conception date for pregnancy losses or induced abortions, we 
were unable to measure rapid repeat pregnancy as such.1 Instead, 
we measured pregnancies that ended within 12 months of the 
index live birth, with additional analyses exploring broader defin-
itions. We also could not capture deliveries outside of health care 
facilities,22 including home births and early pregnancy losses, or 
induced abortions performed outside Ontario.23 We could not 
determine pregnancy intendedness; however, most rapid repeat 
pregnancies are unintended.3 Finally, we had no data on living situ-
ation, marital status, sexual abuse,37 reproductive knowledge,38,39 
breastfeeding and other factors that could affect fertility, or appre-
hension of the first infant by child protective services.40 The roles of 
these factors should be examined in future research.
Conclusion
High unadjusted rates of rapid repeat pregnancy among women 
with intellectual and developmental disabilities suggest that 
such women frequently experience reproductive vulnerability. 
The ability of social, health and health care disparities to explain 
the increased risk suggests that marginalization should be 
addressed in multipronged approaches directed at these dispar-
ities, if improvements in reproductive health are to be achieved.
