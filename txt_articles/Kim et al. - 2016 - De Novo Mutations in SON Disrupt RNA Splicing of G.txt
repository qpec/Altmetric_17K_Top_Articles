The overall understanding of the molecular etiologies of intellectual disability (ID) and developmental delay (DD) is increasing as next-
generation sequencing technologies identify genetic variants in individuals with such disorders. However, detailed analyses conclusively
confirming these variants, as well as the underlying molecular mechanisms explaining the diseases, are often lacking. Here, we report on
an ID syndrome caused by de novo heterozygous loss-of-function (LoF) mutations in SON. The syndrome is characterized by ID and/or
DD, malformations of the cerebral cortex, epilepsy, vision problems, musculoskeletal abnormalities, and congenital malformations.
Knockdown of son in zebrafish resulted in severe malformation of the spine, brain, and eyes. Importantly, analyses of RNA from affected
individuals revealed that genes critical for neuronal migration and cortex organization (TUBG1, FLNA, PNKP, WDR62, PSMD3,
and HDAC6) and metabolism (PCK2, PFKL, IDH2, ACY1, and ADA) are significantly downregulated because of the accumulation of
mis-spliced transcripts resulting from erroneous SON-mediated RNA splicing. Our data highlight SON as a master regulator governing
neurodevelopment and demonstrate the importance of SON-mediated RNA splicing in human development.
Recent advances in whole-exome and whole-genome
sequencing have accelerated the identification of the
genetic etiologies of intellectual disability (ID) and devel-
opmental delay (DD), facilitating appropriate care and
therapy for affected individuals and their families. So far,
mutations in more than 1,500 genes have been implicated
in ID and DD disorders,1–9 and de novo single-nucleotide
variants and copy-number variations (CNVs) have been
identified as a major cause of severe ID and/or DD.5,7
Recently, two independent studies reported on a single in-
dividual with ID and/or DD and a de novo mutation in
SON (SON DNA binding protein [MIM: 182465]), which
encodes a protein required for proper RNA splicing. How-
ever, the level of evidence required for securely implicating
mutations in this gene as disease causing was lacking.5,10,11
Including these two individuals, we recruited a total of 20
unrelated individuals with mild to severe ID and/or DD
(Figure 1A and Table S1) and report on the delineation of
an ID syndrome caused by de novo LoF mutations in
SON. This study was approved by the local institutes under
the realm of diagnostic testing.
We compared in detail the phenotypic characteristics of
all 20 individuals with SON LoF mutations. Clinical exami-
nation showed that all affected individuals had mild to
moderate facial dysmorphisms, including facial asymmetry,
midface retraction, low-set ears, downslanting palpebral
fissures, deep-set eyes, horizontal eyebrows, a broad and/
or depressed nasal bridge, and a short philtrum (Figures
1B and Figure S1). Interestingly, brain MRI, available for
19 affected individuals, revealed that 17 of them had
significant abnormalities, including abnormal gyration
patterns (polymicrogyria, simplified gyria, and periven-
tricular nodular heterotopia), ventriculomegaly, Arnold-
Chiari malformations, arachnoid cysts, hypoplasia of the

 corpus callosum, hypoplasia of the cerebellar hemispheres,
and loss of periventricular white matter (Figures 1C–1E). 11
of 20 individuals developed seizures and/or epilepsy with
an age of onset ranging from 1 to 6 years. 17 of 20
individuals presented with musculoskeletal abnormalities,
comprising hemivertebrae, scoliosis or kyphosis, contrac-
tures, hypotonia, and hypermobility of the joints. Vision
problems, including cerebral visual impairment, hyperme-
tropia, optic atrophy, and strabismus, were present in 15
of 20 individuals. In addition, the vast majority of individ-
uals
showed
congenital
malformations
consisting
of
urogenital malformations (6/20), heart defects (5/20), gut
malformations (3/20), and a high and/or cleft palate
(2/20). Short stature was present in ten individuals, and cra-
niosynostosis involving both the metopic (n ¼ 1) and the
sagittal sutures (n ¼ 2) was noted in 3 of 20 individuals.
Metabolic screening was performed in 9 of 20 individuals,
confirming mitochondrial dysfunction in individuals 2
and 11 and an O-glycosylation defect in individual 20 (a
clinical summary is provided in Table 1, and details are
listed in Table S2). Apart from individuals 13 (II-1 in family
13; Figure 1A), 15 (II-3 in family 15), and 20 (II-1 in family
20), none of the individuals had additional coding-
sequence mutations that explained (part of) the phenotype
(Table S2). Individual 13 was clinically diagnosed with dys-
keratosis congenita, for which a maternally inherited path-
ogenic TERT (MIM: 187270) mutation was identified (Table
S2). Individual 13 was, however, more severely affected
than could be explained by a TERT mutation alone. Simi-
larly, none of the other coding variants identified in indi-
vidual 15 or the additional genes deleted by the 384 kb dele-
tion CNV in individual 20 were likely to explain the
phenotype of these individuals (Table S2).
SON (GenBank: NM_138927.2) is composed of 12
exons (Figure 2A) and encodes a protein (GenBank:
NP_620305.2) containing an arginine/serine (RS)-rich
domain and two RNA-binding motifs (a G-patch and a
double-stranded RNA binding motif) (Figure 2A).12–14 17
of 20 mutations are frameshift mutations, including a
recurrent 4-bp deletion (c.5753_5756del) in four inde-
pendent individuals (Table S1 and Figures 2A and 2B).
The remaining mutations include a nonsense mutation,
an in-frame deletion of eight amino acids, and a complete
gene deletion (Table S1). Importantly, parental DNA was
available for testing in 19 of 20 individuals and indicated
that all mutations had occurred de novo (Figure S2 and
Table S1). Interestingly, de novo truncating mutations in
SON have not been observed in over 2,000 control in-
dividuals,4,15–18 and SON, with a Residual Variation Intol-
erance Score of �1.88, belongs to the 2% most intolerant
human protein-coding genes.19 Furthermore, interroga-
tion of large databases (such as the Exome Aggregation
Consortium
[ExAC]
Browser)
has
shown
that,
after
sequence context and mutability are considered, SON is
significantly depleted of LoF variants according to multiple
LoF metrics (pLI ¼ 1.00, and the false-discovery rate of the
LoF depletion score is p ¼ 1.68 3 10�6).20,21 Although
these population genetic signatures of intolerance cannot

 be considered sufficient evidence of causality on their own,
they support the hypothesis that SON LoF mutations are
under strong purifying selection in the human population
and that their occurrence most likely contributes to severe
clinical phenotypes.
Transcripts bearing a premature stop codon are likely to
be degraded by nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. To
confirm that LoF mutations result in reduced dosage of
SON, we used three different PCR primer sets (Table S3)
to perform qRT-PCR to determine the amounts of the
SON transcript in peripheral-blood mononuclear cells
(PBMCs) isolated from trio 1 (I-1, I-2, and II-2 in family 1),
trio 3 (I-1, I-2, and II-1 in family 3), individual 5 (II-1 in
family 5; Figure 1A), and an unrelated healthy donor
(Figure 2C). All three primer sets showed that compared
to mRNA from the parental samples and the unrelated
healthy donor, SON mRNA in the affected individuals
was significantly downregulated (Figure 2C). Subsequent
western blotting using PBMC lysates from trio 1 and
two different SON antibodies consistently showed the
reduction of SON in individual 1 (Figures 2D and 2E), indi-
cating that de novo SON LoF mutations result in SON
haploinsufficiency.
To examine the effect of SON haploinsufficiency on em-
bryonic development, we utilized Danio rerio (zebrafish),
which has a well-conserved homolog of human SON (NCBI
Gene:LOC565999;FiguresS3andS4).Weassessedthedevel-
opmental effects of SON haploinsufficiency in vivo with
morpholino (MO)-mediated knockdown of son in zebrafish
embryos. Interestingly, embryos injected with a son MO
had a host of developmental defects that ranged from bent
tails (63.6%) to eye malformations and microcephaly
(17.1%) and shortened or gnarled tails, deformed body
axes, and massive body curvatures (2.1%) 24 hr post-injec-
tion (hpi) (Figure 3A and Figure S5). Embryos that survived
72 hpi progressed to more severe phenotypes including
extremespinalmalformations(22.2%), head and eyemalfor-
mations with brain edema (37.2%), and profound develop-
mentalabnormalities(10.1%;Figure3B),mimickingfeatures
observed in the affected individuals.
SON is a nuclear speckle protein able to bind to
both DNA and RNA, and its cellular functions include
regulation of RNA splicing and gene transcription, as
well
as
proper

and

underlying

discrete heterotopic nodules (orange arrowheads). A thin corpus callosum, a small fourth ventricle, enlarged frontal horns of the lateral
ventricles, and cavum septum pellucidum are present.

 stem cells.25 Surprisingly, from these previous datasets, we
noticed that a group of genes playing pivotal roles in
neuronal cell migration, embryonic survival, metabolism,
and mitochondrial function, including TUBG1 (MIM:
191135), FLNA (MIM: 300017), PNKP (MIM: 605610),
WDR62 (MIM: 613583), PSMD3, HDAC6 (MIM: 300272),
PCK2 (MIM: 614095), PFKL (MIM: 171860), IDH2 (MIM:
147650), ACY1 (MIM: 104620), and ADA (MIM: 608958),
showed significantly decreased expression upon SON
knockdown (Tables S4 and S5).13,22,25 To investigate
whether genes involved in regulating brain development
and in metabolism are also downregulated in individuals
with SON LoF mutations, we measured the levels of RNA
expression of these genes in PBMCs from trio 1, trio 3,
and individual 5, as well as from an unrelated healthy
donor (primers are listed in Table S3). Using qPCR analysis,
we confirmed that all 11 genes were indeed significantly
downregulated in individuals with SON haploinsufficiency
(Figures 4A and 4B).

correct and efficient RNA splicing of weak splice sites and

(C) Real-time qPCR with three different primer pairs showed that SON mRNA from the affected individuals was overall downregulated in
comparison to mRNA from the parents and unrelated normal individual. Error bars represent mean 5 SD. *p < 0.001.
(D and E) Western blotting demonstrated reduced expression of SON. SON-N antibody (1:1,000) was generated against amino acids
74–88 of the human SON (amino acid sequence DTELRYKPDLKEGSR). The cocktail of WU SON antibodies was a mixture of three
different SON antibodies (WU09 [1:100], WU14 [1:2,000], and WU21 [1:200]). The epitopes of WU SON antibodies were as follows:
MDSQMLATSS for WU09, CEESESKTKSH for WU14, and SMMSAYERS for WU21. SON-N antibody (D) and the cocktail of SON WU
antibodies (E) showed similar results. The bands indicated by the black arrow represent full-length SON. Other bands, which could re-
present potential isoforms, were also detected. Besides the bands present in samples from both normal and affected individuals, no other
specific bands were detected in the affected individuals.

 and human embryonic stem cells have included intron
retention and exon skipping, which have been shown at
the gene level for TUBG1, HDAC6, and ADA.13,22,25 We
next sought to determine whether RNA splicing of these
11 genes is also impaired in our individuals with SON
haploinsufficiency. To this end, we analyzed the pre-mRNA
sequences of the remaining eight genes to predict weak
splice sites that could be potential targets of SON-mediated
RNA splicing (Table S6). We performed RT-PCR by using
DNase-treated RNA samples isolated from trio 1, trio 3, indi-
vidual 5, and an unrelated healthy donor and using primers
designed to detect intron retention and exon skipping
(Tables S6 and S7). We not only confirmed that these sites
were indeed mis-spliced in HeLa cells upon SON knockdown
(Figure S6) but also found that all three affected individuals
showed significant intron retention (TUBG1, FLNA, PNKP,
WDR62, PSMD3, PCK2, PFKL, IDH2, and ACY1) and exon
skipping (HDAC6 and ADA) at the predicted sites of the
target pre-mRNAs and that this resulted in the accumulation
ofmis-splicedproducts(Figures4Cand4D).Incontrast,mis-
spliced RNA products were absent in the parents and
unrelated donor (Figures 4C and 4D). Together, these results
indicate that SON-mediated RNA splicing is severely
compromised in individuals with SON haploinsufficiency.
Our data have revealed that the complex neurodevelop-
mental disorder observed in these affected individuals is
due to compromised SON function, which causes insuffi-
cient production of downstream targets as a result of erro-
neous SON-mediated RNA splicing. Moreover, the roles of
several downregulated genes are well-known causes of ID
and/or DD in humans (Tables S4 and S5).4,6,26–35 For
instance, FLNA haploinsufficiency is the most common
cause
of
periventricular
nodular
heterotopia
(MIM:
300049),35 a rare brain malformation that we also found
among our cohort with SON LoF mutations. Similarly, de
novo LoF mutations in TUBG1 are known to result in cortical
malformations (MIM:615412),32alsofrequentlyobserved in
our cohort of affected individuals. Because we have shown
that a substantial number of essential developmental genes
are significantly downregulated upon SON haploinsuffi-
ciency, SON thus represents a master regulator of genes
essential for human neurodevelopmental processes.
In summary, we have identified de novo LoF mutations
in SON as a cause of a complex neurodevelopmental disor-
der associated with ID and/or DD and severe brain malfor-
mations. In addition, we have revealed the underlying
molecular mechanism by showing that SON haploinsuffi-
ciency leads to defective RNA splicing of multiple genes
critical for brain development, neuronal migration, and
metabolism. Our findings thus greatly contribute to our
understanding of how defective RNA splicing leads to
human neurodevelopmental disorders.
