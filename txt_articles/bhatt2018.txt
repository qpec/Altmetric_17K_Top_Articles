IMPORTANCE It is not clear whether adherence to preprocedural fasting guidelines prevent
pulmonary aspiration and associated adverse outcomes during emergency department (ED)
sedation of children.
OBJECTIVE To examine the association between preprocedural fasting duration and the
incidence of sedation-related adverse outcomes in a large sample of children.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We conducted a planned secondary analysis of a
multicenter prospective cohort study of children aged 0 to 18 years who received procedural
sedation for a painful procedure in 6 Canadian pediatric EDs from July 2010 to February 2015.
The primary risk factor was preprocedural fasting duration. Secondary risk factors were age,
sex, American Society of Anesthesiologists classification, preprocedural and sedation
medications, and procedure type.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Four outcomes were examined: (1) pulmonary aspiration,
(2) the occurrence of any adverse event, (3) serious adverse events, and (4) vomiting.
RESULTS A total of 6183 children with a median age of 8.0 years (interquartile range, 4.0-12.0
years), of whom 6166 (99.7%) had healthy or mild systemic disease (American Society of
Anesthesiologists levels I or II), were included in the analysis. Of these, 2974 (48.1%) and 310
(5.0%) children did not meet American Society of Anesthesiologists fasting guidelines for
solids and liquids, respectively. There were no cases of pulmonary aspiration. There were 717
adverse events (11.6%; 95% CI, 10.8%-12.4%), of which 68 (1.1%; 95% CI, 0.9%-1.3%) were
serious adverse events and 315 (5.1%; 95% CI, 4.6%-5.7%) were vomiting. The odds ratio
(OR) of occurrence of any adverse event, serious adverse events, and vomiting did not
change significantly with each additional hour of fasting duration for both solids (any adverse
event: OR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.98 to 1.02; serious adverse events, OR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.95-1.07;
vomiting: OR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.97-1.03) and liquids (any adverse event: OR, 1.00; 95% CI,
0.98-1.02; serious adverse events: 1.01, 95% CI, 0.95-1.07; vomiting: OR, 1.00; 95% CI,
0.96-1.03).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this study, there was no association between fasting
duration and any type of adverse event. These findings do not support delaying sedation to
meet established fasting guidelines.

pproximately1ofevery100childrenwhovisitanemer-
gency department (ED) for care receives sedation for
common medical procedures, such as fracture reduc-
tion and complex laceration repair.1 Conservatively, this trans-
lates to 25 000 ED sedations in Canada, 60 000 in the United
Kingdom, and 250 000 in the United States each year.2-4 Al-
though procedural sedation is regarded as safe, approxi-
mately 1% of children experience a serious adverse event.1 Ar-
guably the most feared, potentially life-threatening adverse
event is pulmonary aspiration, which is defined as the inha-
lation of oropharyngeal or gastric contents into the larynx and
lower respiratory tract.5,6
With the goal of reducing the occurrence of pulmonary as-
piration in sedated patients, preprocedural fasting guidelines
weredevelopedusingconsensusopinionbyorganizationssuch
as the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) and Ameri-
can Academy of Pediatrics.7-9 These guidelines specify a mini-
mum fasting period of 2 hours for clear liquids, 4 hours for
breast milk, 6 hours for infant formula and light meals, and
8 hours for solids containing meat or fatty foods.7
However, some clinical experts contend that preproce-
duralfastingguidelines,whichwereoriginallyintendedforpa-
tients undergoing elective procedures, are not directly appli-
cable to ED procedural sedation, because the risk of clinically
important pulmonary aspiration is thought to be signifi-
cantly less as a result of differences in baseline patient risk, se-
dation medications used, and procedures performed in this
setting.10-13 Consistent with this view, several relatively small,
single-center cohort studies of children undergoing proce-
dural sedation have not shown an association between fast-
ing duration and adverse events such as oxygen desatura-
tion, vomiting, and apnea.13-16 Furthermore, prolonged fasting
has been associated with less-favorable outcomes in some pa-
tients, and it consumes finite human and physical ED re-
sources during periods of extended waiting.10,17,18 As a result,
adherence to preprocedural fasting guidelines is highly vari-
able in emergency medicine.14,16,19
Given these limitations, the American Academy of Pedi-
atrics has concluded that the true association of preproce-
dural fasting duration with serious adverse events such as pul-
monary aspiration remains unknown for children undergoing
sedation for emergency procedures, and they advocate fur-
ther research “in many thousands of patients”20(pe6) to better
define relationships, be they any adverse event, fasting inter-
vals, and sedation complications. To address this gap, we per-
formed a planned secondary analysis of what we believe is the
largest, prospective cohort study of children to date who have
received emergency procedural sedation.1 Our broad objec-
tive was to examine any association between the incidence of
sedation-related adverse outcomes and preprocedural fast-
ing duration.
Methods
We performed an a priori planned secondary analysis of a mul-
ticenter prospective cohort study conducted in 6 Canadian pe-
diatric EDs from July 10, 2010, to February 28, 2015.1 All sites
are members of Pediatric Emergency Research Canada, a na-
tional collaborative research network. Study methods have
been previously described in detail.21

ten consent, according to site-specific ethics regulations, was
obtained from parents or guardians, and assent was obtained
from children 7 years and older.
Study Setting and Population
Children aged 0 to 18 years who were undergoing parenteral
proceduralsedationforpainfulprocedureswereeligibleforen-
rollment in the study. Children were excluded if they re-
ceived a drug purely for anxiolysis or analgesia without the in-
tent of sedation or if there was a language barrier present, as
determined by the health care professional obtaining in-
formed consent. Sedations with missing clinical data about the
timing of last oral intake for solids or liquids were excluded
from this substudy.
Definitions
Standardized definitions from the Quebec Guidelines, a con-
sensus-based document developed by North American ex-
perts in pediatric procedural sedation, were used to deter-
mine time intervals and adverse events.6 Adverse event
definitions require both the specific clinical event to have oc-
curred (eg, oxygen desaturation) and 1 or more appropriate in-
terventions to be performed with the intention of treating or
managing it (eg, airway repositioning, oxygen administration
or increase in oxygen delivery, or positive pressure ventila-
tion). Specific definitions from the Quebec Guidelines for ad-
verse events reported in this study are documented in eTable
1 in the Supplement.
Outcome Measures
Four outcomes were examined for our primary objective:
(1) clinically apparent pulmonary aspiration, (2) the occur-
rence of any adverse event, (3) serious adverse events, and
Key Points
Question Does the duration of preprocedural fasting alter the risk
pulmonary aspiration and associated adverse outcomes in children
undergoing emergency department procedural sedation?
Findings In this study of 6183 healthy patients undergoing
sedation in 1 of 6 geographically separate and nationally
representative Canadian emergency departments, 2974 (48.1%)
did not meet fasting guidelines prior to sedation. Data analysis
failed to identify an association between preprocedural fasting of
any duration and any type of adverse event, and there were no
cases of clinically apparent pulmonary aspiration.
Meaning Delaying sedation to meet established fasting guidelines
appears not to improve sedation outcomes for children in the
emergency department.

 (4) vomiting. Clinically apparent pulmonary aspiration was de-
fined as the suspicion or confirmation of oropharyngeal or gas-
tric contents in the trachea during the sedation or physiologic
recovery phase and the appearance of respiratory signs and
symptoms that were not present before the sedation. Any ad-
verse event, an aggregate measure, was defined as the occur-
rence of any 1 of the 15 adverse events under surveillance in
our study (eTable 1 in the Supplement). Serious adverse events
were defined as the occurrence of apnea, laryngospasm, hy-
potension, bradycardia, complete airway obstruction, clini-
cally apparent pulmonary aspiration, permanent neurologic
injury, or death. Vomiting was defined as the expulsion of gas-
tric contents through the nose or mouth during sedation in-
duction or maintenance or ED recovery. Study outcomes were
chosen to encompass events that are direct precursors to pul-
monary aspiration (vomiting) and those that have a higher
probability of requiring positive pressure ventilation, thus in-
creasing the risk of aspiration (serious adverse events).
Risk Factors
The primary risk factor of interest was fasting duration for sol-
ids and liquids. Fasting duration was analyzed both as a con-
tinuous variable (in number of hours prior to sedation) and as
a dichotomous variable with the cut point determined by the
ASA preprocedural fasting guidelines as 6 or more hours for
solids and 2 hours or more for liquids. Other risk factors and
potentialconfoundersforadversesedationoutcomeswerecho-
senapriori,basedonclinicalknowledgeandliteraturereview.6
These included age, sex, sedation medication, American So-
ciety of Anesthesiology (ASA) physical status classification,22
useofpreproceduralopioids(anyopioidadministeredwiththe
intent of treating pain prior to the administration of the first
sedation medication), and procedure type. For the outcome
of vomiting, preprocedural antiemetic administration was also
examined. Risk factors were measured using patient or paren-
tal report, review of the medical record, and physical exami-
nation findings.
Statistical Analysis
Demographic characteristics and risk factors were summa-
rized using descriptive statistics (median and interquartile
range for continuous variables; frequency and percent for cat-
egorical variables) and compared between guideline compli-
ant and noncompliant groups. Differences between groups
weretestedforstatisticalsignificanceusingPearsonχ2orttests
as appropriate. Observed fasting durations for solids and flu-
ids were described using frequency distributions after catego-
rization at clinically meaningful cut points (2, 4, and 6 hours).
The incidence of sedation-related adverse events was de-
scribed across fasting durations using frequency and percent-
age with 95% CIs adjusted for clustering by site. Variances were
estimated using the Taylor series linearization method. Using
box plots, we compared observed fasting durations for solids
and liquids of patients who experienced any adverse event, a
serious adverse event, or vomiting with patients who did not
experience these outcomes. To examine the statistical asso-
ciation between fasting duration and outcomes, we included
fasting duration as a continuous variable in a multivariable lo-
gistic regression analysis and modeled its association with the
outcomes using restricted cubic splines. To identify the opti-
mal number of knots, we fit separate models with 5 knots
(located at the fifth, 27.5th, 50th, 72.5th, and 95th percen-
tiles), 4 knots (located at the fifth, 35th, 65th, and 95th per-
centiles), or 3 knots (located at the 10th, 50th, and 90th
percentiles). We used visual inspection of the resulting spline
plots for each number of knots, as well as Akaike information
criterion and Wald tests for nonlinearity to determine the func-
tional form of the association that provides the best fit to the
data. To adjust for potential confounders and risk factors, the
identified covariates were included in the models. To reduce
theriskofbiasasaresultofsmallnumbersofeventsandsparse
distributions of covariates, the logistic regression models
were estimated using penalized likelihood with the Firth
adjustment.23,24 Results from the model were expressed as
odds ratios, 95% profile-likelihood CIs, and P values, with sta-
tistical significance assessed at the 5% level. The goodness
of fit of each model was evaluated using the Hosmer-
Lemeshow test. The regression models were used to obtain
plots of predicted probabilities of each outcome as a function
of fasting duration for solids and liquids respectively, with cat-
egoricalandcontinuousconfoundersheldconstantatthemode
and median respectively. Statistical analyses for this article
wereperformedfromJanuary2016toJune2017usingSAS,ver-
sion 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc) and R, version 3.0.2 (R Founda-
tion for Statistical Computing).
Results
Patient Characteristics
Of the estimated 9650 eligible sedations, 6295 (65.2%) were
included in the final analysis of the parent study.1 We ex-
cluded 112 sedations that were missing information regard-
ing the time of last solid or liquid intake prior to sedation, leav-
ing 6183 sedations (98.2% of the original cohort) in the current
analysis. Of the 6183 patients, 6166 (99.7%) were classified as
ASA physical status classification I or II, 4124 (66.7%) were
male, and the median age was 8.0 years (interquartile range,
4.0-12.0 years). Ketamine alone was the most commonly used
sedation medication (n = 3847; 62.2%) and orthopedic reduc-
tion was the most common procedure (n = 4076; 65.9%)
(Table 1).
A total of 2974 children (48.1%) and 310 children (5.0%)
did not meet ASA fasting guidelines for solids and liquids, re-
spectively. Comparison of baseline characteristics of patients
who did and did not fulfill fasting guidelines are shown in
Table 1. For solids and liquids, there were a number of statis-
tically significant differences between compliant and non-
compliant groups; however, the only clinically significant dif-
ferences between groups were age (solids) and sedation
medication (solids and fluids).
Incidence of Sedation-Related Adverse Events
Overall, there were 717 adverse events (11.6%; 95% CI,
10.8%-12.4%). There were no cases of clinically apparent
pulmonary aspiration. Oxygen desaturation (n = 340; 5.5%;

 95% CI, 5.0%-6.1%) and vomiting (n = 315; 5.1%; 95% CI,
4.6%-5.7%) were the most common events. Of the 315 vom-
iting events, 6 events (1.8%) occurred during sedation, while
the remainder occurred during recovery. Details of these 6
patients are shown in Table 2; all met fasting guidelines for
fluids, while only half met fasting guidelines for solids. All
patients who met fasting guidelines had a fasting duration of
at least 10 hours. Serious adverse events occurred in 68
patients (1.1%; 95% CI, 0.9%-1.3%).
Association of Fasting Duration With Adverse Events
Table 3 presents the observed incidence of any adverse event,
serious adverse events, and vomiting across fasting intervals
for solids and liquids that are classified by duration: short (≤2
hours), intermediate (2 to 4 hours and 4 to 6 hours) and long
(>6 hours). Box plots comparing fasting times for patients with
and without events are presented in Figure 1. The results show
no visible differences in distributions of fasting times be-
tween those with and without any adverse event, serious ad-
verse events, or vomiting.
The restricted cubic spline plots, Akaike information cri-
terion statistics, and tests for nonlinearity for the 5-knot,
4-knot, and 3-knot splines are presented in eFigures 1, 2, and

tion criterion statistic reached a minimum when fasting du-

ration. The modeled associations, together with 95% CIs, are
depicted graphically in Figure 2.
Discussion
The overall incidence of adverse events in our population was
11.6% (95% CI, 10.8%-12.4%). Serious adverse events oc-
curred in 68 patients (1.1%; 95% CI, 0.9%-1.3%), and vomiting
occurred in 315 patients (5.1%; 95% CI, 4.6%-5.7%). There were
no cases of clinically apparent pulmonary aspiration. When
fasting duration was modeled as a continuous variable using
the best-fitting function form (a simple linear term), we did
not observe a relationship between the duration of pre-
procedural fasting and any type of sedation-related adverse
event.
Our study findings provide support to the idea that strict
adherence to ASA fasting guidelines does not improve pa-
tient outcomes for children undergoing procedural sedation
in the ED. Delaying sedation to meet fasting guidelines does
not appear to decrease adverse event rates but has the poten-
tial to lengthen ED length of stay and impede patient flow.
These findings support the recommendation from the Ameri-
can College of Emergency Physicians not to delay ED proce-
dural sedation based solely on fasting time.25
Previous studies of ED procedural sedation have shown no
associationbetweenfastingdurationandadverseevents.How-
ever, because of the small sample sizes (range, 218-1555
patients)13-16 and limited statistical power of these studies, the
ASA has stated, “The literature does not provide sufficient evi-
dence to test the hypothesis that preprocedure fasting results
in a decreased incidence of adverse outcomes in patients un-
dergoing either moderate or deep sedation.”9(p1007) Further-
more, previous studies did not model fasting duration opti-
mally but rather categorizes fasting duration at arbitrary cut
points, which assumes the relationship between fasting du-
ration and adverse events is flat within intervals and results
in a loss of power and precision.13-16 From the previous litera-
ture,thebestriskestimateforaspirationwas15casesin10 000
sedations.16 Although we also did not observe any cases of pul-
monary aspiration, this large sample allows us to conclude that
the risk is no more than 3.1 in 10 000 sedations.1 It is impor-
tant to note that, to our knowledge, there have never been any
reported cases of pulmonary aspiration in children undergo-
ing parenteral sedation in the ED setting, despite widespread
nonadherence with fasting guidelines.14,16,19,26
It is generally thought the risk of aspiration in ED proce-
dural sedation is less than the risk in elective sedation and gen-
eral anesthesia. Beach and colleagues24 from the Pediatric Se-
dation Research Consortium recently published evidence of
the association of fasting duration with the incidence of ma-

Point estimate probabilities of adverse events were obtained from the fitted
logistic regression models for the association of fasting duration for solids and
liquids and any adverse event (A and B), serious adverse events (C and D), and
vomiting (E and F), after adjusting for age (1-year intervals), sex, preprocedure
opioid administration, sedation medication, procedure type, and preprocedure
ondansetron administration (vomiting model only) by setting categorical
covariates to their modal category and continuous covariates to their median.

 jor complications in 139 142 children undergoing procedural
sedation outside of the operating room. In this population of
sicker children (of whom 17% had an ASA classification of III
or greater), who were undergoing longer elective sedations
(53% for magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomogra-
phy) and were primarily sedated with propofol (76%), there
were 10 cases of aspiration, all of which occurred in children
who fasted from solids for longer than 6 hours. The authors
also found no association between fasting duration and aspi-
ration or other major complications. Furthermore, they con-
cluded the risk of aspiration was 0.7 cases per 10 000 seda-
tions, which was approximately one-half to one-third the risk
associated with general anesthesia. In this context, the esti-
mated risk of aspiration of no more than 3.1 cases per 10 000
sedations in our population of healthy children undergoing
short, painful procedures is conservative and likely an over-
estimate.
Limitations
Our study has several important limitations. First, given the
observational nature of our study design, direct causal infer-
ences cannot be made. Second, though approximately half of
the patients did not fulfill fasting guidelines for solids, only 112
of 6183 patients (1.8%) consumed solids within 2 hours of their
sedation.Thismakesitdifficulttodrawfirmconclusionsabout
theassociationofshorterfastingdurationswithadverseevents.
Third, despite a large sample size, we did not observe any cases
of clinically apparent pulmonary aspiration. However, this is
not surprising, given that the literature contains no reported
cases of aspiration in ED parenteral sedation. Fourth, all study
sites were tertiary care academic children’
s hospitals, which
may limit the generalizability of our results to practice in gen-
eralhospitals.Finally,alargeproportionofourpatients(62.2%)
received ketamine alone, which is consistent with the litera-
ture indicating it is the most commonly used medication in ED
sedation for children.1,14,16,27,28 Unlike other sedatives, ket-
amine has been shown to maintain airway protective reflex
properties and may result in a decreased risk of aspiration. In
our cohort, ketamine alone was used more frequently in the
group of patients who did not meet fasting guideline recom-
mendations for elective sedation (2017 patients [67.8%]) com-
pared with those who did (1830 patients [57.0%]). It is pos-
sible our results could be confounded by indication. We did
adjust for all known risk factors, including sedation medica-
tion, in our multivariable analysis; however, it is possible that
there were unmeasured factors for which we were unable to
account.
To address these limitations, future research should fo-
cus on compilation of much larger data sets using rigorous
methodology and standardized outcome measurements,6,29
which would allow for accurate determination of the actual as-
piration rate associated with ED procedural sedation. Co-
horts including larger numbers of patients who have short pre-
procedural fasting durations would add to our understanding
of aspiration risk in the ED population.
Conclusions
To our knowledge, our study is the largest prospective ED pro-
cedural sedation cohort, with the most complete documen-
tation of fasting status and outcome ascertainment and most
robust statistical analyses conducted to date. In this study
population, we failed to identify an association between fast-
ing duration and any type of adverse event. These results in-
dicatethatdelayingsedationtomeetestablishedfastingguide-
lines does not improve sedation outcomes for children in the
ED and is not warranted.
