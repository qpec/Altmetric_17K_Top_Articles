Summary
The common assumption that population sleep duration has declined in the past few decades has 
not been supported by recent reviews, which have been limited to self-reported data. The aim of 
this review was to assess whether there has been a reduction in objectively recorded sleep duration 
over the last 50+ years.
The literature was searched for studies published from 1960–2013, which assessed objective sleep 
duration (TST) in healthy normal-sleeping adults. The search found 168 studies that met inclusion 
criteria, with 257 data points representing 6,052 individuals ages 18–88 years. Data were assessed 
by comparing the regression lines of age vs. TST in studies conducted between 1960–1989 vs. 
1990–2013. Weighted regression analyses assessed the association of year of study with age-
adjusted TST across all data points. Regression analyses also assessed the association of year of 
study with TST separately for 10-year age categories (e.g., ages 18–27 years), and separately for 
polysomnographic and actigraphic data, and for studies involving a fixed sleep schedule and 
participants’ customary sleep schedules.
Analyses revealed no significant association of sleep duration with study year. The results are 
consistent with recent reviews of subjective data, which have challenged the notion of a modern 
epidemic of insufficient sleep.

Introduction
It has been widely stated that modern industrialized societies have become sleep-deprived. 
Some studies have suggested that average sleep duration has declined over the last few 
decades [1–4]. Such findings, combined with extensive epidemiologic evidence associating 
short sleep with health risks [5–7] and experimental evidence of adverse effects of sleep 
deprivation [8–10], have provoked widespread concern that chronic insufficient sleep has 
become a public health crisis.
However, recent reviews of self-reported data have cast doubt on whether nighttime sleep or 
24-h sleep has decreased in recent decades, and whether there has been an increased 
prevalence of short sleep (<6 h), for which risks have been most clearly established. For 
example, a review of eight studies by Knutson et al. found no significant 31-year trend 
(1975–2006) towards a higher prevalence of self-reported nighttime sleep of ≤ 6 h [11]. Bin 
et al. reviewed 12 studies from 15 countries assessed from the 1960s–2000s, and found that 
sleep duration had increased in 7 countries, decreased in 6 countries, and had not clearly 
changed in 2 countries [12]. In a subsequent meta-analysis of 38 studies conducted in 10 
countries in the 1970s–2000s, Bin et al. [13] found that average 24-h sleep duration had 
increased in most countries (including the US), and that the prevalence of sleeping ≤ 6 h had 
decreased in most countries (including the US). Rowshan Ravan et al. studied 36-year trends 
(1968–2004) in sleep duration among Swedish women, and found no change in 50-year old 
women, and a decline of only 15 minutes in 38-year old women [14]. Moreover, Bonke 
reviewed five representative time-use studies spanning 1964–2009, and concluded that “the 
same number of hours is slept today as in the mid-1960s, with nearly the same prevalence of 
short and long sleepers” [15].
Discrepancies between studies of population temporal trends in sleep duration can be 
attributed to multiple factors, including characteristics and representativeness of the 
respondents, wording of the questions, and instructions given to respondents [16, 17]. 
Perhaps the biggest limitation of this literature is that it has been limited to self-reports of 
sleep duration (some of which were retrospective), which can be inaccurate [18, 19] due in 
part to response biases. The aim of this review was to examine whether there has been a 
decline over the past 5 decades in sleep duration, as indexed by objective data.
Methods
The search of the literature was modeled after a previous meta-analysis by Ohayon et al., 
which assessed objective sleep patterns across age [20]. PubMed, PsychLit, selected 
journals, and reference lists of located manuscripts were searched for studies published 
between 1960–2013 which met the following criteria: 1) inclusion of presumably healthy 
adults (as described by the authors), participant ages ≥18 y without sleep problems; 2) report 
of all-night average total sleep time (TST) measured by polysomnography (PSG) or

 actigraphy; 3) assessment of sleep under minimally-disturbed conditions, including baseline 
or placebo conditions, and not involving particularly invasive procedures (e.g., 
catheterization). Many of the studies included a control group of presumably normal 
sleepers who had been compared with participants with sleep disorders. Studies involving 
individuals with extremely high levels of physical fitness were excluded under the 
assumption that sleep of such individuals might not be representative of the population. Key 
search words were sleep with normal, normative, healthy, controls, and adults.
The literature searches were performed by two of the authors: either EEG or NK. Questions 
regarding whether a study met inclusion criteria were resolved in discussions between EEG 
and SDY or AMR and SDY. Data from the studies were extracted by EEG and AMR.
The search identified >3,500 studies, of which 168 met the inclusion criteria, generating 257 
data points across 6,052 individuals. Studies were separated into PSG (Table 1) and 
actigraphic studies (Table 2). Citations for all included studies are listed in the reference list 
(#55–222). Coding for each study included the mean sample age (or mid-point of the age 
range if the mean age was not available), number of men and women subjects, mean sample 
total sleep time (min), and estimated year of study. Studies with multiple age groups 
generated multiple data points for the analyses. When available, separate data points for men 
and women were used. Since most of the studies recorded sleep in the laboratory, only the 
laboratory data were used for studies that included both home and laboratory data, except for 
separate analysis of the actigraphy data.
Since the year of publication of a study often differed from the year in which a study was 
conducted, the following rules were used to estimate the year that a study had been 
conducted. 1) Year of study was estimated by subtracting 10 months from the posted date of 
journal receipt of the manuscript for studies with <50 subjects, 14 months for studies with 
50–99 subjects, 18 months for studies with 100–149 subjects, and 22 months for studies 
with ≥150 subjects. 2) If information was available regarding the date a paper was accepted, 
but not the date that it was received, the median across-the-literature duration in months 
between date received and date accepted (4 months) was subtracted from the date of 
publication, and Rule 1 was followed. 3) If neither date accepted nor date received 
information was available, the median number of months between date received and date 
published (11 months) was subtracted from the date of publication, and Rule 1 was 
followed.
The TST data were first assessed by comparing the intercepts of the regression lines of age 
vs. TST for studies conducted between 1960–1989 vs. 1990–2013. We chose this split to 
obtain a more balanced number of data points across the years split. Another reason for 
the1989/1990 split was that it has been posited that the obesity epidemic, which started 
shortly after this time, can be partly attributed to declines in sleep. Examining the intercepts 
allowed an assessment of temporal differences in TST across all data points (without 
adjustment for age). A temporal decline in TST would be revealed by a smaller intercept for 
the 1990–2013 studies compared with the 1960–1989 studies. Another rationale for 
the1989/1990 split was that it has been posited that the obesity epidemic, which started 
shortly after this time, can be partly attributed to declines in sleep [21].

 To further assess a temporal trend of TST across all data points, a linear regression analysis 
of year of study (weighted for sample size) and participants’ age vs. TST was calculated. To 
plot these data, age-adjusted TST was determined based on the slope of the linear regression 
between TST and age across all data points. An a priori decision was made to remove 
outlying samples, for which mean age-adjusted TST was ≥ 2 standard deviations from the 
mean value across the literature. Two data points were removed based on this criterion. 
Weighted linear regression analyses were also conducted for year of study vs. TST across 
10-year age categories (e.g, ages 18–27 years, 28–37 years, etc.).
Separate weighted linear regression analyses were conducted for data from studies in which 
participants followed their usual sleep schedules and for studies involving a fixed sleep 
period; for polysomnographic and actigraphic data; and for data involving men only and 
women only. Plots of year of study vs. age-adjusted TST were performed for each of these 
analyses.
Results
The intercepts and slopes of the regression lines of age vs. TST did not differ for studies 
conducted between 1960–1989 and 1990–2013 (Figure 1). In the regression analysis across 
all data points (n=257), there was no significant association of year of study with TST (b=.
03, p=0.56) (Figure 2), nor was there a significant association of study year with TST for 
any of the 10-year age categories (Figure 3) (p=0.40–0.92). Likewise, there was no 
significant association of year of study in analyses restricted to PSG (n=225) (b=0.03, 
p=0.63) or to actigraphic data (n=32) (b=−0.17, p=0.38) (Figure 4); or in analyses involving 
only men (n=71) or only women (n=17) (Figure 5). Finally, there was no significant 
association in analyses derived from studies in which subjects followed their usual sleep 
periods (n=154) (b=0.13, p=0.10) or a fixed sleep period (n=68) (b=−0.14, p=0.24) (Figure 
6).
Discussion
The results indicate relative stability of objectively-recorded sleep durations in healthy 
sleepers assessed over the last half-century. Similar results were found across all age groups; 
in both men and women; for both PSG and actigraphic data; and under conditions of fixed 
sleep periods and participants’ usual sleep schedules. These data are consistent with recent 
comprehensive reviews that found no consistent or compelling evidence of significant 
decrements in self-reported sleep duration and/or prevalence of short sleep over a similar 
range of years [11–15]. Together, these data cast doubt on the notion of a modern epidemic 
of insufficient sleep.
There were several limitations of the literature, which might have confounded demonstration 
of temporal changes in sleep duration. First, although virtually all of the studies failed to 
describe the racial/ethnic composition of the samples, it is a reasonable assumption that 
participants in most of these studies were not representative of the population. Recent 
research has suggested that the prevalence of short sleep is relatively high among Blacks, 
and that this prevalence might be increasing more among Blacks than among Whites [22].

 Furthermore, most of the studies either excluded women or failed to report separate data for 
women and men. Thus, there was an insufficient number of data points (n=17) to adequately 
assess whether there was a temporal decline in women’s sleep duration, which might have 
occurred as more women have entered the workforce over the past 50 years [11, 15]. Study 
samples have also likely been unrepresentative of the population in other factors which have 
been associated with sleep duration, including employment status, education, occupation, 
and socioeconomic status.
A second limitation is that most of the studies assessed sleep with PSG in the laboratory, a 
process that can result in curtailed sleep duration. The confound was reduced in most of the 
PSG studies by disregarding data obtained during the first night of laboratory recording 
(eliminating “first night effects”) [23]. Interestingly, in a post-hoc assessment of studies that 
measured sleep objectively both at home and in the laboratory, the median difference 
between home and laboratory TST was only 3.2 min (Table 3). However, the use of PSG 
recording could have inhibited sleep, and sleep might have been more disrupted in earlier 
PSG studies due to greater novelty associated with PSG, as well as less technologically 
advanced methods, such as the use of collodion for securing electrodes.
Constraints of PSG recording might not capture a decline in nighttime sleep that has 
occurred at home when people are more able to follow their customary habits, which might 
involve staying up later. Roenneberg et al.’s surveys of thousands of adults assessed from 
2002–2010 have found a decline of approximately 30 min in reported sleep duration on 
weekdays [24]. However, the present review did not find a similar change in home 
actigraphic sleep duration over the past 10–20 years. Likewise, a recent study by Gubelmann 
et al. found no decline in reported time in bed from 2005–2011 among a large Swiss sample 
(n=3,853) [25].
A third limitation is that studies with fixed sleep periods (usually 8 h) could have resulted in 
sleep restriction for some individuals, particularly if the timing of the sleep periods was not 
consistent with the participants’ usual sleep schedule. This restriction could have been 
generally greater in earlier studies if sleep duration truly had declined. However, a similar 
age-adjusted mean TST was observed for studies involving fixed (443.3±31.7 min) and 
habitual sleep schedules (435.1±37.4 min), and there was a similar absence of a significant 
secular trend in TST for fixed and habitual sleep schedules (Figure 6). Figure 6A might 
reflect a societally-imposed or custom-imposed 8-hr ceiling in how long people usually 
spend sleeping. It is also possible that PSG technicians have been reluctant to extend the 
night shift beyond 8 h.
A fourth limitation is that compared with more recent studies, it is possible that earlier 
studies did not screen as well for absence of sleep apnea and other sleep disorders; this 
difference in screening methods might have resulted in lower estimates of sleep duration. 
However among adults above middle age, a small amount of sleep apnea or periodic limb 
movements is so common that it might be considered normal. Relatively more drug studies 
in recent years could have contributed to more extensive participant screening of normal 
sleepers, resulting in samples that sleep longer than population norms. However, a similar 
absence of a decline in sleep duration was found in the 18–27 year old adults, for whom the

 prevalence of sleep apnea and other health problems is relatively low. Also contrary to the 
hypothesis that more recent studies have had more homogenous samples of good sleepers, a 
post-hoc analysis showed no significant correlation between year of study and sample 
standard deviation of TST (r=−0.01).
A fifth limitation is that mean nighttime sleep duration data for a sample might not reflect 
temporal changes in the prevalence of short or long sleep, nor changes in 24-hr sleep 
duration which might have occurred. Interestingly, Figures 1–3 suggest a higher prevalence 
of sleep of ≤6 h over the last 20 years, particularly among 18–27 year old participants.
In recent decades, the siesta tradition has waned considerably in some countries [26]. 
Without corresponding increases in nighttime sleep, this could have resulted in a temporal 
decline in 24-h sleep in these countries. Partial support for this hypothesis was provided by 
Bin et al., who found in a meta-analysis that 24-h sleep duration decreased by 22 min from 
1989–2002 in Italy [13], whereas there was not a decline in 24-h sleep in 8 of the other 9 
countries assessed, none of which has had a notable siesta tradition (Australia, Canada, 
Finland, Germany, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, United Kingdom, United States).
However, there has been limited empirical investigation of temporal trends in napping. Wolf-
Meyer traces a historical decline in napping to the industrial revolution, increased structure 
of the work day, and the origins of sleep medicine which has promoted a theoretical need for 
8 hours of sleep at night [27, 28]. Thus, through much of the 20th century, napping in many 
industrialized countries was regarded as a sign of laziness [28]. However, attitudes and 
practices of napping have apparently changed over the past 10–20 years, as evidenced by 
formal sanctioning of work-day napping and commercial napping services in some cities.
Napping is relatively more common among older adults who have less nighttime sleep and 
less consolidation of the sleep-wake cycle than young adults. Compared with previous older 
cohorts, some factors could have resulted in less napping in contemporary seniors, such as 
later retirement age, more physically and socially active lifestyles, and greater rates of 
residence in senior living facilities.
Nonetheless, the present review is the first to explore historical patterns of objective sleep 
duration, which has long been regarded as the gold standard for defining sleep duration [18]. 
Further, the findings have several implications. Although historically 8 h of sleep was 
thought to be optimal for health and well-being, an extensive epidemiologic literature has 
indicated that 7 h of self-reported sleep is associated with the lowest health risks [29], with 
progressively higher risks associated with shorter as well as longer reported sleep. However, 
since objectively-recorded sleep duration is generally 30–60 min less than self-reported 
sleep, optimal objective sleep duration for longevity and health might be only 6–6.5 h. For 
example, Kripke et al. recently found 5–6.5 h of actigraphic sleep was associated with lower 
mortality than <5 h and > 6.5 h [30]. The present review adds to recent reviews of self-
reported data, which have also indicated no decline in sleep duration over the last 50 years. 
If the optimal duration of objective sleep is indeed between 6–6.5 hours, the review also 
suggests that more participants in these studies might be at risk due to long sleep than to 
short sleep.

 Had sleep duration truly declined by 1–2 hours over the last 50 years, as many sleep 
researchers have claimed, the signal to detect this would be at least as great as that 
associated with age, which shows only a decline of about 1 h from young adulthood to the 
elderly (Figure 1). The results also contradict the hypothesis that such a decline in sleep is a 
probable culprit in modern epidemics of obesity and diabetes [21].
Notwithstanding these findings, assumptions about a steady decline in sleep duration over 
the past few decades persist, and could be explained by many factors. First, increased public 
awareness about sleep and the dangers of inadequate sleep, coinciding with an exponential 
increase in sleep disorders diagnoses with the emergence of sleep medicine [31], could have 
partly shaped these perceptions. Greater knowledge about sleep, perhaps especially a greater 
ability to distinguish between sleep and time spent in bed, could lead to perceptions of less 
sleep.
Second, sleep is commonly considered in the context of leisure time and being a respite 
from daily stressors [32]. In what seems to many to be an increasingly fast-paced and 
stressful world, there is a perception of having less free time for “rest.” Third, evidence 
indicates that the prevalence of depression has increased over time [33], and depression is 
associated with reports of poor or inadequate sleep [34].
Fourth, self-reported behavior is influenced by perceived social norms [26, 35], and the 
perception that we have become a sleep-deprived society has likely been shaped partly by 
promotion of this message in the popular media and by sleep scientists. However, much of 
the narrative regarding an epidemic of declining sleep has been based on arguments which 
have not been well-supported by empirical data. We address some of these arguments in the 
following section, although much of this discussion is also not well-supported by empirical 
observations.
Decline of Sleep in Children?
A particularly poignant argument for an epidemic of insufficient sleep is that sleep among 
children and adolescents has declined, due to many factors, including greater use of 
electronic media at night and reduced parental enforcement of bedtimes. The fear that 
children are sleeping less has apparently existed for over a century [36], and in recent years 
this fear may have contributed to the increased rates of hypnotic prescriptions for children 
[37].
A recent empirical review by Matricciani et al. found that reported sleep duration of children 
and adolescents has declined by an average of 70 min per night since 1895 [38]. However, 
these data should be considered within the context of the tremendous difference in physical 
activity levels of modern children compared with children of over a century ago who were 
required to work on family farms, and for 60 h per week in mines, sweatshops, factories, etc. 
[39]. The Matricciani et al. review found that reported sleep duration of children and 
adolescents has declined by only about 15 min per night since 1970 [38], and this difference 
could also be partly explained by dramatic declines in children’s physical activity levels 
during this period of time, as walking/cycling to school and playing outdoors have been 
largely replaced by car rides and sedentary indoor activities [40]. Changes in reported sleep

 duration of children should be verified with a review of objective sleep data analogous to the 
present review.
Twenty-four hour society?
The cliché of an ever-expanding 24/7 society [41] is not well-supported by empirical 
evidence, at least not over the past 50 years. For example, evidence suggests that the 
prevalence of shift-work has remained stable at about 15–20% over this interval of years [42, 
43]. Such data might seem counterintuitive in light of the increased number of 24-h services 
and businesses. However, while many of these businesses (e.g, restaurants and convenience 
stores) can operate all-night with just a few employees, over the past half-century there has 
been a dramatic disappearance of factories which once employed thousands of shift-workers. 
Moreover, over the past 10–20 years, protective regulations and practices which limit shift-
work and sleep deprivation and/or better accommodate individual’s preferences (e.g,. flex 
time and telecommuting), have been implemented for various occupations, including 
medical residents, truck drivers, and transportation workers [44, 45].
A Decline in Sleep Over the Centuries?
It is a widely repeated hyperbole that never before in human history have we faced such 
challenges to our sleep [46]. It has been hypothesized that industrialization, urbanization, 
and technological advances have caused us to ignore or override our natural tendency to 
sleep more, and we do so at great costs to our health and quality of life. Wolf-Meyer has 
noted that this “fall from grace” sentiment can be traced back at least as far as the pioneering 
work of Nathaniel Kleitman [27, 28]. However, historical accounts belie the myth that 
people slept longer or better centuries ago, when sleep was compromised by pestilence, fear 
of night marauders, poorer ability to control ambient temperature or treat illnesses, etc. [28, 
47]. By Ekirch’s estimation, sleep centuries ago typically occurred in two nighttime in-bed 
periods, with each period lasting approximately 3–4 h, suggesting that average sleep 
duration probably did not exceed 7 h (personal communication) [48].
The light bulb has been blamed for sleep loss [49]. However, recent anthropologic studies of 
people in societies with little or no electricity have failed to indicate that these people sleep 
more than people in industrialized societies [50, 51].
In summary, it is beyond dispute that disrupted and inadequate sleep are highly prevalent 
and associated with significant risks, and that experimental sleep deprivation has myriad 
negative effects [52, 53]. Thus, the notion of a recent epidemic of insufficient sleep, and 
speculation that this is a primary contributor to modern epidemics of obesity, diabetes, 
metabolic syndrome, etc., rests largely on the question of whether sleep duration has 
declined in the last few decades. Consistent with recent reviews of subjective data [11–15, 
54], this review does not support this notion, at least not in healthy sleepers

 Practice Points
1.
Systematic reviews of the literature have generally not shown that average 
self-reported sleep duration has declined, nor that the prevalence of short 
sleep duration (< 6 h) has increased over the past few decades [11–15].
2.
Limitations of the objective-recording literature include unrepresentative 
samples; assessment of sleep mostly with PSG under laboratory conditions; 
and almost no studies of 24-hr sleep patterns.
3.
The data indicate no significant change in objective TST over the last 50+ 
years.
4.
Reasons for persistent assumptions about a temporal decline in societal 
sleep duration could include greater knowledge about sleep and the risks of 
inadequate sleep; increased prevalence of depression; misperceptions about 
population norms; and persistent claims in the popular and scientific 
literature regarding a so-called modern epidemic of insufficient sleep.

 Research Agenda
1.
A similar analysis of temporal trends in objective sleep duration in children 
and adolescents should be undertaken. A recent review indicated a decline 
in reported sleep duration of about 70 min per night among children and 
adolescents over the last century [38], which should be confirmed with 
objective data.
2.
A similar analysis of temporal changes in other measures of objective sleep, 
such as sleep latency and sleep efficiency, should be conducted to address 
whether the quality of sleep has changed over time.
3.
Further historical studies focused specifically on sleep duration and other 
sleep variables might uncover more information about sleep changes over 
time.
4.
Future large-scale prospective, representative, multi-national studies of 
objective sleep (using actigraphy) could address whether there are future 
population changes in sleep.
