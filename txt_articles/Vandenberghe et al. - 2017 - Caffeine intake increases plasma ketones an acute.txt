ABSTRACT  
 
Brain glucose uptake declines during aging and is significantly impaired in Alzheimer’s disease. Ketones 
are the main alternative brain fuel to glucose so they represent a potential approach to compensate for the 
brain glucose reduction. Caffeine is of interest as a potential ketogenic agent owing to its actions on 
lipolysis/ lipid oxidation but whether it is ketogenic in humans is unknown. This study aimed to evaluate 
the acute ketogenic effect of two doses of caffeine in healthy adults (2.5; 5.0 mg/kg) during a 4-hour 
metabolic study period. Caffeine given at breakfast significantly stimulated ketone production in a dose-
dependent manner (+88%; +116%) and also raised plasma free fatty acids. Whether caffeine has long-
term ketogenic effects or could enhance the ketogenic effect of medium chain triglycerides remains to be 
determined. 
 
Key words: Ketones; Ketonemia; Caffeine; Free fatty acids; Medium chain triglycerides; Lipolysis;

RÉSUMÉ 
La consommation cérébrale de glucose diminue avec l’âge et, tout particulièrement, avec la maladie 
d’Alzheimer. L’élaboration de différentes stratégies nutritionnelles pour optimiser la production de cétones, 
le principal carburant alternatif cérébral, est nécessaire afin de soutenir les besoins énergétiques du 
cerveau vieillissant. La caféine est une molécule d’intérêt en raison de son action sur le métabolisme 
lipidique. L’effet aigu de différentes doses de caféine (2.5; 5.0 mg/kg) sur la production de cétones était 
évalué chez dix sujets. Nos résultats ont montré que la caféine ajoutée à un repas stimule 
significativement la cétonémie à des concentrations comparables à un jeûne de 12h et cette réponse est 
dose-dépendante (+88 à +116%). Ainsi, la prise de caféine combinée avec une source alimentaire 
cétogène comme les triglycérides à chaine moyenne dans le but de maximiser la cétonémie constitue une 
piste prometteuse d’intervention en concomitance avec d’autres traitements thérapeutiques dans un 
contexte de maladies neurodégénératives.

INTRODUCTION 
1 
 
2 
Caffeine upregulates metabolic rate (Miller et al. 1974), and stimulates energy expenditure. It is an 
3 
adenosine receptor antagonist that increases sympathetic activity (Bellet et al. 1969) and inhibits cyclic 
4 
nucleotide phosphodiesterase, which is responsible for catalyzing the conversion of cyclic adenosine 
5 
monophosphate (cAMP) to AMP (Butcher et al. 1968; Quan et al. 2013). As a result, higher tissue 
6 
concentrations of cAMP activate hormone-sensitive lipase and promote lipolysis (Acheson et al. 2004; 
7 
Butcher et al. 1968). Free fatty acids (FFA) are the product of lipolysis and can be used as an immediate 
8 
source of energy by many organs. They can also be converted by the liver into ketones (acetoacetate 
9 
[AcAc], β-hydroxybutyrate [β-HB] and acetone). Most organs use glucose and FFA as energy substrates. 
10 
However, the brain is unable to use FFA for energy, and requires ketones as the principal alternative fuel 
11 
to glucose (Cunnane et al. 2016). Plasma ketones are highly positively correlated to their utilization by the 
12 
brain (Cunnane et al. 2016; Mitchell et al. 1995) and can provide up to 70% of brain’s total energy during 
13 
period of hypoglycaemia as, for example, during fasting (Owen et al. 1967).  
14 
 
15 
Brain glucose uptake is 10-15% lower during normal aging (Nugent et al. 2014), and can be up to 35% 
16 
lower in certain brain regions in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) 
17 
(Castellano et al. 2015). Several studies suggest that brain glucose hypometabolism potentially 
18 
contributes to the onset and/or progression of AD (Cunnane et al. 2016; Mosconi et al. 2005; Nugent et al. 
19 
2014; Reiman et al. 2004; Schöll et al. 2011). A ketogenic supplement could therefore potentially help 
20 
support the brain’s energy needs during aging. Hence, the primary aim of this study was to evaluate 
21 
whether the lipolytic effect of caffeine acutely increases plasma ketones in healthy adults during a four-
22 
hour metabolic study period. The secondary aim was to confirm whether caffeine increases FFA as 
23 
previously reported (Acheson et al. 1980; Acheson et al. 2004).

Ethical approval for this study was obtained from the Research Ethics Committee of the Integrated 
29 
University Health and Social Services of the Eastern Townships – Sherbrooke University Hospital Center, 
30 
which oversees all human research done at the Research Center on Aging (Sherbrooke, QC, Canada). All 
31 
participants provided written informed consent prior to beginning the study. They underwent a screening 
32 
visit, including the analysis of a blood sample collected after a 12 h overnight fast. Exclusion criteria 
33 
included regular high consumption of caffeine (>300 mg/day), smoking, diabetes or glucose intolerance 
34 
(fasting glucose >6.1 mmol/L and glycosylated hemoglobin >6.0%), untreated hypertension, dyslipidemia, 
35 
abnormal renal, liver, heart or thyroid function. This project is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT 
36 
02694601).  
37 
 
38 
Experimental design 
39 
The protocol involved three randomized four-hour metabolic study days: a baseline metabolic day (CTL) 
40 
and two days each with a different dose of caffeine (2.5 mg/kg [C-2.5] and 5.0 mg/kg [C-5.0]). On each 
41 
metabolic study day, the participants arrived at 8:00 a.m. after 12 h of fasting and 24 h without caffeine 
42 
intake. At the time of signing the consent form, participants were aware of the 12 h fast and to abstain 
43 
from consuming caffeine. They also received a reminder call 24 h before the metabolic study day. A 
44 
forearm venous catheter was installed and blood samples were taken every 30 min during 4 hours. After 
45 
installing the catheter and the first blood sample, participants received a standard breakfast comprised of 
46 
two pieces of toast with raspberry jam, a piece of cheese, applesauce and 100 ml of juice. The breakfast 
47 
contained 85 grams of carbohydrate, 9.5 g of fat and 14 g of protein.  Commercially available caffeine 
48 
tablets (200 mg extra-strength Life Brand™, ON, Canada) were hand crushed to powder and two doses 
49 
were provided (2.5 mg/kg and 5.0 mg/kg) on separate test days. The low dose corresponding to 1½ cup of 
50 
coffee and the high dose to 3 cups of regular coffee, the highest quantity recommended by Heath 
51 
Canada. The caffeine dose to be given was mixed in 104 ml of applesauce and consumed during 
52 
breakfast. No caffeine was added to the breakfast for CTL. Water was available ad libitum throughout the 
53 
study day. Blood samples were centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 10 min at 4°C and plasma was stored at -80°C 
54 
until further analysis.

Plasma analyses 
57 
 
58 
Caffeine  
59 
Plasma caffeine was measured using a complete ELISA Kits from Neogen (WI, USA), according to the 
60 
manufacturers’ protocol with the following modifications. Caffeine (Sigma-Aldrich®, St-Louis, Mo, USA) 
61 
was diluted with the Neogen kit buffer (EIA) at multiple dilutions ending with the standard curve dilutions 
62 
from 0 to 25 ng/ml. Plasma samples were then diluted with EIA buffer at a 1:50 000 dilution. Both 
63 
standards and samples were run in duplicate. The absorbance was then measured with a plate reader 
64 
(VICTOR, Perkin Elmer Inc, MA, USA) at 690 nm. 
65 
 
66 
Metabolites 
67 
Plasma glucose, lactate, triglycerides, total cholesterol (Siemens Medical Solutions USA, Inc., Deerfield, 
68 
IL, USA) and free fatty acids (Randox Laboratories Ldt, West Virginia, USA) were measured using 
69 
commercial kits on a clinical biochemistry analyzer (Dimension Xpand Plus, Siemens Healthcare 
70 
Diagnosis Inc., Deerfield, IL, USA) as previously described (Courchesne-Loyer et al. 2013). Plasma β-HB 
71 
and AcAc were evaluated by an automated colorimetric assay as previously described (Courchesne-Loyer 
72 
et al. 2013).  
73 
 
74 
Statistical analysis 
75 
All results are given as mean ± SEM. Ten participants were sufficient to meet the statistical power 
76 
(β=0.80) needed to observe a significant difference in plasma FFA with the caffeine supplementation 
77 
(Acheson et al. 1980). For lactate, metabolic study day values were normalized to baseline in order to 
78 
account for variability at the beginning of the study day. For post-caffeine ketone and FFA analysis, the 
79 
area under the curve (AUC) was calculated from 2 to 4-hour post-dose because that was when maximal 
80 
plasma caffeine was achieved. All statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS 23.0 software (SPSS 
81 
Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Comparison of the three test conditions was done using the Friedman test, and 
82 
the effect of caffeine supplementation was determined in each group using a Wilcoxon’s signed rank test.

Differences were considered statistically significant at p≤0.05. Data were graphed using Prism version 6.0 
84 
(GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA).

86 
RESULTS 
87 
Two men and eight women completed all three test conditions (Table 1). Participants were 33 ± 19 years 
88 
of age and had a body mass index of 24 ± 8 (n=10). The participant’s baseline biochemical parameters 
89 
corresponded to normal references values from the Sherbrooke University Hospital Center (Sherbrooke, 
90 
Qc). No significant side effects were reported following caffeine intake. Baseline plasma caffeine values 
91 
did not significantly differ from zero on any of the three study days (Fig.1). There was no difference in 
92 
plasma glucose, triglycerides, or cholesterol response across the three metabolic days (data not shown). 
93 
Plasma lactate differed across the three metabolic days (p=0.045), but after normalizing the data to 
94 
baseline, these differences disappeared (p=0.607). 
95 
 
96 
A dose-response was observed for plasma caffeine across the three metabolic days (p<0.05; Fig. 1). 
97 
Plasma caffeine significantly increased during the first hour post-dose (p<0.05). C-2.5 increased plasma 
98 
caffeine to a maximum of 7.5 ± 1.5 mg/L at 2 h and C-5.0 increased plasma caffeine to a maximum of 
99 
10.0 ± 2.3 mg/L at 3 h (p<0.05). No difference in plasma AcAc levels was observed across the three test 
100 
days (p=0.497; Fig 2A, 2C). However, after normalizing the data to baseline, there was a significant group 
101 
difference between baseline and the two doses of caffeine at 3.5 h, at which time AcAc was significantly 
102 
increased (p<0.05; data not shown). A group difference was observed for the β-HB response from 2 to 4 h 
103 
post-dose (p<0.05; Fig. 2B and 2D). Caffeine increased plasma β-HB by 88% and 116% in a dose-
104 
dependent manner (p<0.05). No significant difference in plasma FFA was observed during 0-2 h post-
105 
dose (Fig. 3A). Globally, FFA decreased from 711 ± 398 µM to 91 ± 42 µM during this period (Fig. 3A). 
106 
Between 2 – 4 h after the breakfast, a dose-related increase of FFA was observed with the two doses of 
107 
caffeine (p<0.005; Fig. 3B). C-2.5 raised plasma FFA concentrations to 548 ± 276 µM after 4 h whereas 
108 
C-5.0 raised plasma FFA to 695 ± 433 µM.

DISCUSSION 
111 
 
 
112 
This short-term study showed that caffeine intake can stimulate ketogenesis by increasing β-HB 
113 
concentrations by 88-116% with a maximum within four hours post-dose. A dose-response was observed 
114 
for plasma β-HB (Fig. 2D) but not for AcAc (Fig. 2C), which could be explained by the larger inter-group 
115 
variation in AcAc. The increase in plasma ketones obtained with these doses of caffeine could at least 
116 
transiently contribute to 5-6% of brain energy needs (Cunnane et al. 2016). 
117 
The increased plasma FFA after caffeine seen in the present study confirms prior results (Acheson et al. 
118 
1980; Acheson et al. 2004; Bellet et al. 1968; Bellet et al. 1969). Caffeine competes for the adenosine 
119 
receptor, inhibits phosphodiesterase activity and increases plasma FFA. FFA entering the liver are beta-
120 
oxidized and converted to ketones due to condensation of pairs of acetyl-CoA units as their availability 
121 
exceeds their utilization by the tricarboxylic acid cycle (Wang et al. 2014).  
122 
 
123 
The increase in blood ketones shown here was equivalent to that observed after an overnight fast. 
124 
Another way of increasing blood ketones is to provide a source of medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) 
125 
(Courchesne-Loyer et al. 2013). Caffeine combined with an MCT supplement could potentially prolong 
126 
mild ketonemia. Such products are already available on the market although no reports are available on 
127 
the ketogenic effect of the combination of these products.  
128 
One limitation of this study design is that the metabolic study period was only 4 hours. However, this was 
129 
sufficient to observe an effect on plasma ketones and FFA within the period during which peak plasma 
130 
caffeine was observed. The half-life of caffeine is 4.5 hours, which suggests that its peak metabolic effect 
131 
would take place over 2-3 hours. Furthermore, the effect of each caffeine dose was only assessed once, 
132 
so a longer term study would be useful.  
133 
 
134 
In conclusion, by enhancing lipolysis and increasing blood FFA levels, which in turn provide substrates for 
135 
ketogenesis, caffeine at doses of 2.5 and 5.0 mg/kg stimulated safe and mild ketonemia in healthy adults 
136 
to a ketone level twice that seen after an overnight fast. Several studies suggest that regular caffeine 
137

8 
consumption may be linked to the decreased risk of developing late-life cognitive decline (Panza et al. 
138 
2015). Further studies are needed to evaluate caffeine’s long term effect on ketonemia and its impact on 
139 
brain function during aging.
