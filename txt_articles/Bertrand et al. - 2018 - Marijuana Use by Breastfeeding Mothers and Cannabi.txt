BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Marijuana is the most commonly used recreational drug among 
breastfeeding women. With legalization of marijuana in several US states and a 1990 study 
in which authors documented psychomotor deficits in infants breastfed by mothers using 
marijuana, there is a need for information on potential exposure to the breastfed infant. 
Our objective with this study was to quantify cannabinoids in human milk after maternal 
marijuana use.
METHODS: Between 2014 and 2017, 50 breastfeeding women who reported marijuana use 
provided 54 breast milk samples to a research repository, Mommy’s Milk. Concentrations 
of Δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (∆9-THC), 11-hydroxy-Δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, cannabidiol, 
and cannabinol were measured by using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry 
electrospray ionization.
RESULTS: ∆9-THC was detectable in 34 (63%) of the 54 samples up to ∼6 days after last 
reported use; the median concentration of ∆9-THC was 9.47 ng/mL (range: 1.01–323.00). 
Five samples had detectable levels of 11-hydroxy-Δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (range: 
1.33–12.80 ng/mL) or cannabidiol (range: 1.32–8.56 ng/mL). The sample with the highest 
concentration of cannabidiol (8.56 ng/mL) did not have measurable ∆9-THC. Cannabinol 
was not detected in any samples. The number of hours since last use was a significant 
predictor of log ∆9-THC concentrations (−0.03; 95% confidence interval [CI] −0.04 to 
−0.01; P = .005). Adjusted for time since last use, the number of daily uses and time from 
sample collection to analysis were also significant predictors of log ∆9-THC concentrations 
(0.51; 95% CI 0.03 to 0.99; P = .039; 0.08; 95% CI 0.00 to 0.15; P = .038, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: ∆9-THC was measurable in a majority of breast milk samples up to ∼6 days after 
maternal marijuana use.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Previous data used 
to quantify the transfer of Δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol and 
other cannabinoids into human breast milk after maternal 
marijuana use are limited to several case reports.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: In 50 women reporting 
marijuana use while breastfeeding, Δ-9-
tetrahydrocannabinol was measurable in 63% of milk 
samples, up to 6 days after last use; 11-hydroxy-Δ-9-
tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol were measurable 
in 9% of milk samples, and cannabinol was undetectable 
in all samples.

 Marijuana is the most commonly 
used recreational drug among 
breastfeeding women (Supplemental 
Fig 2).1, 
 
2 However, potential infant 
exposure to marijuana through 
breastfeeding is poorly understood. 
This question is of critical importance 
because human milk is the normative 
standard for infant feeding and 
nutrition.3 The World Health 
Organization recommends exclusive 
breastfeeding up to 6 months of 
age.4 Being breastfed early in life has 
been associated with a reduction in 
subsequent obesity and improved 
performance on intelligence tests. 
In mothers, breastfeeding has been 
associated with lower risks for 
subsequent breast and uterine cancer 
and type 2 diabetes.5, 
 
6
However, there is a paucity of data 
on the effects of maternal marijuana 
use among infants potentially 
exposed through breast milk. Authors 
of case reports have documented 
the presence of the primary 
psychoactive ingredient in marijuana, 
∆-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (∆9-THC), 
in human milk.7 In 1 report, the level 
of ∆9-THC measured in a milk sample 
provided by a mother who smoked 
marijuana once daily was 105 ng/mL. 
 
The concentration in a sample 
from a second mother who smoked 
marijuana 7 times per day was 340 
ng/mL. In an additional set of paired 
milk and maternal plasma samples 
obtained from one of these mothers, 
the ∆9-THC concentration measured 
in the milk sample (60.3 ng/mL) was 
8 times higher than the maternal 
plasma concentration of 7.2 ng/mL, 
suggesting that ∆9-THC accumulated 
in breast milk.8 Furthermore, 
fecal samples from that mother’s 
infant had higher concentrations 
of other metabolites (11-hydroxy-
Δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol 
[11-OH-THC] and Δ-9-carboxy-
tetrahydrocannabinol) than the 
mother’s breast milk, suggesting the 
infant absorbed and metabolized the 
∆9-THC after breast milk ingestion. 
In another case report, a single 
human milk sample obtained from a 
woman with a history of drug abuse 
was found to have detectable levels 
of both ∆9-THC (86 ng/mL) and 
11-OH-THC (5 ng/mL).9 Authors of a 
third published study analyzed 109 
randomly collected milk samples 
with no accompanying information 
on maternal marijuana use; ∆9-THC 
was detected in 2 samples and 
cannabidiol in 1.10
There are limited data on the 
potential neurobehavioral effects of 
infant exposure to cannabis through 
breast milk. Astley and Little11 
reported psychomotor deficits 
in fifty five 12-month-old infants 
breastfed by mothers using cannabis 
compared with 81 unexposed infants. 
In contrast, Tennes et al12 reported 
no differences in motor and mental 
development in twenty seven 
12-month-old infants whose mothers 
used marijuana while breastfeeding 
compared with 35 unexposed infants.
Lacking definitive data on the risk  
or safety of infant exposure to 
cannabis through breast milk, the 
American Academy of Pediatrics 
and the American Congress of 
Obstetricians and Gynecologists  
advise that marijuana use should be 
discouraged while breastfeeding.13, 
 
14  
However, with current legalization 
of marijuana for recreational use in 
9 US states, there is an urgent need 
for characterization of cannabinoid 
distribution in human milk and  
the corresponding potential  
exposure of breastfeeding infants 
and toddlers. The purpose of this 
study was to measure cannabinoid 
concentrations in breast milk in 
relation to dose and time since last 
maternal marijuana use.
METHODS
Study Design
In 2014, the University of California, 
San Diego established Mommy’s Milk, 
the human milk biorepository (HMB) 
for research. Volunteers residing in 
the United States and Canada have 
been recruited into HMB through a 
variety of sources including social 
media. After providing written 
informed consent for future research 
uses of milk samples and associated 
data, breastfeeding mothers 
completed an interview providing 
demographics, maternal and child 
health history, and details regarding 
exposures to medications, alcohol, 
tobacco, and other recreational 
substances. Participants recalled 
their exposures for the 14 days 
before milk sample collection and 
provided additional information on 
exposure to herbal supplements, 
prescription medications, or 
recreational substances since giving 
birth. Women were instructed to 
pump and collect 50 mL of milk up 
to a full expression as close to the 
time of the scheduled interview as 
possible and up to 24 hours before. 
Any quantity of milk ≥1 mL was 
accepted. The HMB protocol was 
approved by the Institutional Review 
Board at the University of California, 
San Diego, and a National Institutes 
of Health Certificate of Confidentiality 
was obtained.
Assessment of Exposure
For HMB participants who 
reported marijuana use at any time 
since giving birth, the maternal 
questionnaire data included route 
of administration (inhaled, ingested, 
topical), frequency of use, dose, and 
time since last use before sample 
collection. If mothers indicated a 
dose unit of joints, puffs, or grams, 
the route of administration was 
classified as “inhalation only”; 
those who indicated a dose unit 
of drops, milligrams, or servings 
were classified as “other only.” 
Those who reported ˃1 route of 
administration were classified as 
“both.” The frequency of marijuana 
use was determined by calculating 
the average number of uses per day 
during the most recent exposure 
window within the 14-day recall.

 Hours since last use were calculated 
by using the end of the exposure 
interval for the most recent exposure 
up to the time of milk sample 
collection.
Collection and Preparation of Human 
Milk Samples
Before sample collection,  
participants were instructed to  
clean the nipple and areola of the  
breast with an alcohol wipe. Milk  
sampling occurred by using 1 of the  
following 2 methods: (1) if at the  
HMB research center, participants  
pumped milk with a hospital grade  
industrial breast pump (either the 
Medela Symphony or the Hygeia 
Enjoye) using a sterile collection  
kit provided by study staff; or (2)  
if a home collection, participants 
pumped milk into a personal milk 
collection container specific to their 
own hand or electric breast pump. 
For home collections, expressed milk 
was refrigerated at 0 to 4°C until 
either transported on ice to  
the HMB research center or picked 
up by courier within 24 hours of 
collection and shipped overnight on 
ice to the HMB facility. After receipt, 
samples were aliquoted into 1 to  
15 mL cryovials or centrifuge tubes 
and stored at −80°C.
Analytical Procedure
Reference standards (∆9-THC, 
11-OH-THC, cannabidiol, and 
cannabinol) and isotopically 
labeled internal standards (THC-
d3, 11-OH-THC-d3, cannabidiol-d3, 
cannabinol-d3) were purchased from 
Cerilliant (Round Rock, TX). BondElut 
Certify C-18 cartridges (Varian;  
Lake Forest, CA) were used for solid-
phase extraction. High-performance 
liquid chromatography grade water, 
0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile, 
and methanol were purchased from 
Fisher Scientific. Reagent grade 
ammonium formate and pure sodium 
hydroxide pellets were purchased 
from Sigma-Aldrich.
We followed the saponification–
solid-phase extraction method of 
Wei et al15 for sample cleanup and 
extraction with minor modifications.
Chromatographic separation was 
achieved on reverse-phase C-18 
column (MAC-MOD Ace 5 C-18 15 
cm × 2.1 mm). The mobile phase 
consisted of 5 mM ammonium 
formate in 0.05% formic acid (solvent 
A) and acetonitrile in 0.1% formic 
acid (solvent B). A gradient elution 
was performed over 15 minutes 
at a flow rate of 200 µL/minute. 
Retention times for 11-OH-THC, 
cannabidiol, and THC were 9.35, 
10.62, and 11.70 minutes in positive 
ion mode, respectively. Quantitation 
of THC, 11-OH-THC, and cannabidiol 
and isotopically labeled internal 
standards were achieved on a triple 
quadrupole mass spectrometer (API-
4000; AB Sciex, Framingham, MA) 
in positive ion mode. Cannabinol 
and cannabinol-d3 were detected in 
negative ion mode.
Statistical Analysis
Demographic and clinical variables 
for mothers and infants were 
summarized by using frequencies 
and percentages. For each cannabis 
metabolite, concentrations were 
categorized as either above or 
below the quantification limit, which 
was defined as 1 ng/mL. Summary 
statistics for those samples with 
concentrations above the limits of 
quantification for each metabolite 
were computed. Concentrations of 
∆9-THC were log transformed. Linear 
regression models were used to 
estimate associations between the 
log concentrations of ∆9-THC and the 
time since last cannabis exposure, 
frequency of use, dose, and route of 
administration. Other covariates that 
were considered included maternal 
BMI, age and sex of the infant, time 
from sample collection to analysis 
(sample age), time of day of sample 
collection, time since last feed or 
pump, and feeding frequency. Effect 
estimates and 95% confidence 
intervals (CIs) as well as P values 
were reported.
To estimate potential infant exposure 
and infant plasma concentrations, 
we used the ∆9-THC concentrations 
from the linear regression models to 
compute the mean cumulative dose 
of ∆9-THC hypothetically ingested 
over a 24-hour period by a nursing 
3-month-old infant that weighs  
6.1 kg, assuming 3.1875 oz of milk 
was consumed at each feeding over 
8 equally spaced feedings with 6% 
oral bioavailability.16 All statistical 
analyses were performed by using  
R version 3.4.1 with a 2-sided  
P value ˂.05 judged as significant.
RESULTS
Between 2014 and 2017, 50 mothers 
who participated in the HMB 
research repository reported recent 
marijuana use and provided a breast 
milk sample. Four mothers provided 
2 samples at different time points. 
Characteristics of the participants are 
shown in Table 1. Two-thirds of the 
women were breastfeeding a child <1 
year of age. The most common route 
of administration was by inhalation 
only (64%), and most women in the 
sample (88%) reported at least daily 
marijuana use.
As shown in Table 2, ∆9-THC 
was detectable in 34 (63%) of 54 
samples; among these, the median 
concentration of ∆9-THC was 
9.47 ng/mL (range: 1.01–323.00). 
Only 5 (9%) of the 54 samples 
had measurable concentrations of 
11-OH-THC. Similarly, 5 (9%) of 
the 54 samples had measurable 
concentrations of cannabidiol. Only 1 
sample had measurable levels of all 3 
cannabinoids (∆9-THC, 11-OH-THC, 
and cannabidiol); in this sample, 
the concentration of ∆9-THC was 
the highest measured in the series 
(323 ng/mL). Similarly, only 1 other 
sample had measurable levels of 
2 of the cannabinoids (11-OH-THC 
and cannabidiol but not ∆9-THC); 
in that sample, the concentration

Downloaded from 
 of cannabidiol was the highest 
measured in the series (8.56 ng/mL).  
There were no samples with 
detectable levels of cannabinol.
As shown in Table 3 and in Fig 1, 
there was a significant association 
between log ∆9-THC concentrations 
and hours since last marijuana use 
in the fitted regression model. On 
average, for each additional hour 
between last exposure to marijuana 
and the milk sample collection, there 
was a reduction of 0.03 in the log 
concentration of ∆9-THC (95%  
CI −0.04 to −0.01; P = .005). On the 
unlogged scale, this corresponds to a 
reduction in ∆9-THC concentration 
of 3% per hour after last exposure, 
which can be used to estimate a 
half-life of ∼27 hours for ∆9-THC in 
human milk. The longest duration 
between last use of marijuana and 
measurable ∆9-THC was ∼140 hours 
or 6 days (Fig 1).
As shown in Table 3, in each of the 
separate regression models (except 
the model for heavy use), hours 
since last use was a significant 
negative predictor of log ∆9-THC 
concentration. The number of 
uses per day was also significantly 
associated with increasing 
concentrations of log ∆9-THC (0.51; 
95% CI 0.03 to 0.99; P = .039), as was 
sample age in months (0.08; 95% 
CI 0.00 to 0.15; P = .038). No other 
covariates among those considered 
were significant predictors of 
log ∆9-THC concentration (after 
adjusting for hours since last use).
Based on our assumptions regarding 
breastfeeding frequency, quantity 
of milk ingested, and 6% oral 
bioavailability, the estimated 
plasma concentration of ∆9-THC in 
a hypothetical 3-month-old infant 
weighing 6.1 kg was 0.040 ng/mL.  
Compared with the plasma 
concentration of an adult who 
consumed 10 mg of ∆9-THC,  
the estimated infant dose  
ingested via breast milk would  
be ∼1000 times lower.17
∆9-THC was not detectable in 
20 (37%) of 54 samples. Fewer 
women with undetectable levels 
of ∆9-THC reported more than 
daily use compared with women 
with measurable quantities (41.2% 
vs 21.1%). In addition, the mean 
number of hours since last use was  
higher among those women with 
levels below limits of detection 
compared with those above, with 
wide variability across samples 
(53.06 hours [SD 76.54] vs 24.48 
hours [SD 32.87]). However, the 
only statistically significant factor 
differentiating the 2 groups was 
route of administration. The majority

Downloaded from 
 of women with quantifiable levels of 
∆9-THC used marijuana exclusively 
via inhalation (76.5%) compared  
with only 36.8% in the group with 
levels of ∆9-THC below limits of 
detection (P = .010) (data not shown).
DISCUSSION
This is the first study used to quantify 
levels of specific cannabinoids 
detectable in human milk in a 
relatively large sample of mothers 
with detailed and varied histories 
of recent marijuana use of currently 
available products. ∆9-THC, 
11-OH-THC, and cannabidiol were all 
detectable at 1 ng/mL or above in at 
least 1 human milk sample. ∆9-THC 
was detected in 34 (63%) of the 54 
samples analyzed. This finding is 
consistent with the few previously 
published case reports in which 
∆9-THC was measurable in  
human milk.
Cannabinoids are highly lipophilic 
compounds.16, 
 
18 Therefore, it is 
not surprising that metabolites 
would be detected in human milk, 
which is composed of 3% to 5% 
fat.19 However, the fat content of 
human milk is the most variable 
of its macronutrient components; 
hindmilk may contain 2 to 3 times 
the concentration of milk fat found 
in foremilk.20, 
21 As a result, we 
might have expected that women 
in this study who did not provide 
a full expression of the breast 
would have lower concentrations 
of cannabinoids; however, 80% 
of the samples were collected 
from a full expression (Table 1), 
and sample collection type as a 
covariate was not significant in any 
of our models (Table 3). In addition, 
11-OH-THC is less lipophilic than 
∆9-THC, which might explain why 
only 5 of the milk samples had 
measurable concentrations for this 
cannabinoid.16, 
 
18
The number of times a woman 
used marijuana per day was a 
positive predictor of log ∆9-THC 
concentrations in milk. This finding 
was expected and consistent with the 
few previous case reports in which 
higher concentrations were found in 
1 mother who smoked marijuana 7 
times per day compared with another 
who smoked once per day.8
In our study, the sample age was also 
a significant predictor of log ∆9-THC 
concentrations in milk, which was 
unexpected. Cannabinoids are stable 
with minimal degradation long-term 
when frozen, and there is no evidence 
that more metabolites are formed

Separate multivariable linear regression models were used for each covariate with log-transformed ∆9-THC as the 
outcome. All models include hours since last use as a predictor.
a Hours were defined as the number of h between the most recent exposure end date and the date of sample collection.
b Uses per d were defined as the average number of uses of marijuana during the most recent exposure period.
c Route was defined as categorical variable with the following 3 levels: inhalation, other, and both, with inhalation as the 
reference category. Inhalation only was defined as a dose unit of joints, puffs, or grams. Other only was defined as a dose 
unit of drops, milligrams, or servings. Both was defined as a dose unit from both the inhalation only and the other only 
groups.
d For the covariate puffs, the data set was restricted to samples in which the dose unit was indicated as “puffs” (n = 27). 
The covariate puffs were reported as the number of puffs taken per use of marijuana.
e For the covariate heavy use, the data set was restricted to samples in which the dose unit was indicated as puffs 
(n = 27). The covariate puffs were reported as the number of puffs taken per use of marijuana. Heavy use was defined 
as women who reported uses per d and puffs greater than the median values in the sample (1 use per d and 3 puffs per 
use, respectively).
f Sample age was defined as the length of time between the date of milk collection and the date the sample was analyzed, 
measured in mo.
g Time of collection was defined as the time of d at which the sample was expressed, measured in number of h after 
midnight and dichotomized into before noon (AM) and after noon (PM).
h Time since last feed or pump was defined as the difference between the time of the sample collection and the time of the 
most recent feed or pump, measured in h.
i Feeding frequency was defined as the number of feedings per 24 h.

 during storage.15 However, sample 
age was also positively correlated 
with the number of times a woman 
used marijuana per day (ie, dose) 
(Supplemental Fig 3). Thus, the 
association between sample age and 
log ∆9-THC may be explained by this 
artifact in the data.
In this study, we did not measure 
infant plasma concentrations. 
However, on the basis of our 
assumptions, we estimated the  
mean infant plasma concentration  
of ∆9-THC obtained from 
breastfeeding to be ∼1000 times 
lower than the concentration in  
an adult after a single dose of  
10 mg of ∆9-THC.22 A previous  
case report revealed that a nursing 
infant exposed to marijuana via 
breast milk had high concentrations 
of ∆9-THC, 11-OH-THC, and Δ-9-
carboxy-tetrahydrocannabinol 
in feces indicating that the child 
absorbed, metabolized, and excreted 
marijuana metabolites despite the 
lower ∆9-THC levels present in the 
mother’s milk.8 If a child is exposed 
to low levels of ∆9-THC in milk daily, 
there is a concern for accumulation 
of the various cannabinoids in the 
nursing infant because of slow 
elimination from body fat stores and 
continuous daily exposure.16
Because the brain rapidly develops 
during the time period when, ideally, 
a child’s main source of nutrition 
is human milk, brain development 
may be altered by ∆9-THC exposure. 
Authors of previous studies have 
suggested that prenatal exposure 
to cannabis may interfere with 
brain development resulting in 
deficits in cognitive and behavioral 
function.23 
– 
25 It is reasonable to 
speculate that ∆9-THC, 11-OH-THC, 
or cannabidiol exposure during 
breastfeeding, depending on the dose 
and timing, could influence normal 
brain development of a child.
This study had several limitations 
as well as strengths. Samples were 
collected under different conditions, 
not all breast milk collections were 
directly observed, and we relied 
on maternal report of marijuana 
exposure. However, all participants 
completed a 14-day recall guided by 
trained study staff who prompted 
for specific daily use with the aid 
of a calendar. We had detailed 
information on timing and dose 
as well as information on a wide 
variety of other relevant covariates. 
Furthermore, the samples were 
collected from mothers who were 
using currently available cannabis 
products. In contrast, previously 
published data were collected at a 
time when ∆9-THC concentrations 
in marijuana were far less than is 
typical today.17
We did not have infant plasma 
samples; instead, we estimated 
potential infant ∆9-THC exposure 
on the basis of several assumptions. 
Our infant exposure estimates may 
be an under- or overestimation 
depending on infant age and other 
factors. Authors of future studies 
are required to better characterize 
the distribution of cannabinoids in 
human milk through more intensive 
and paired (milk and plasma) 
sampling, with more detailed data 
about the cannabinoid content 
of the product and exact route 
used by the mothers. In addition, 
longitudinal sampling of plasma of 
breastfeeding infants with either 
single-dose exposure (mothers who 
are occasional users) or steady-
state exposure (mothers who are 
frequent users) is needed to determine 
the extent to which cannabinoids 
accumulate in the breastfeeding infant.
With our findings, we also highlight 
a critical need for further research 
on neurodevelopmental outcomes in 
infants breastfed by mothers using 
marijuana. The 1 previous study in 
which authors found psychomotor 
deficits in 12-month-old infants 
breastfed by mothers using cannabis 
was conducted in an era when 
∆9-THC concentrations in marijuana 
were estimated to be one-third of 
what they are today.11,

 CONCLUSIONS
∆9-THC was measurable in highly 
variable concentrations in the breast 
milk of approximately two-thirds of 
samples from women who reported 
marijuana use during breastfeeding 
and up to ∼6 days since last reported 
dose. Although the estimated median 
daily dose of ∆9-THC ingested by 
the infant is low compared with 
adult doses, the high variability in 
breast milk concentrations means 
that some infants may be exposed 
to daily amounts of cannabinoids 
closer to (but still lower than) 
typical adult amounts. Furthermore, 
the extent of oral absorption in 
breastfeeding infants, metabolism 
and accumulation patterns, and 
pharmacologic effects of even 
low levels of cannabinoids on 
neurodevelopment in infants are 
unknown and require further 
study. Because marijuana is the 
most commonly used recreational 
drug among breastfeeding women, 
information regarding risks to 
breastfeeding infants is urgently 
needed.
