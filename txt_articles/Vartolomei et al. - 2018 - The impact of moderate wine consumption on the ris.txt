Objective: To investigate the impact of moderate wine consumption on the risk of prostate 
cancer (PCa). We focused on the differential effect of moderate consumption of red versus 
white wine.
Design: This study was a meta-analysis that includes data from case–control and cohort studies.
Materials and methods: A systematic search of Web of Science, Medline/PubMed, and 
Cochrane library was performed on December 1, 2017. Studies were deemed eligible if they 
assessed the risk of PCa due to red, white, or any wine using multivariable logistic regression 
analysis. We performed a formal meta-analysis for the risk of PCa according to moderate wine 
and wine type consumption (white or red). Heterogeneity between studies was assessed using 
Cochrane’s Q test and I2 statistics. Publication bias was assessed using Egger’s regression test.
Results: A total of 930 abstracts and titles were initially identified. After removal of duplicates, 
reviews, and conference abstracts, 83 full-text original articles were screened. Seventeen studies 
(611,169 subjects) were included for final evaluation and fulfilled the inclusion criteria. In the 
case of moderate wine consumption: the pooled risk ratio (RR) for the risk of PCa was 0.98 
(95% CI 0.92–1.05, p=0.57) in the multivariable analysis. Moderate white wine consumption 
increased the risk of PCa with a pooled RR of 1.26 (95% CI 1.10–1.43, p=0.001) in the multi-
variable analysis. Meanwhile, moderate red wine consumption had a protective role reducing 
the risk by 12% (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.78–0.999, p=0.047) in the multivariable analysis that 
comprised 222,447 subjects.
Conclusions: In this meta-analysis, moderate wine consumption did not impact the risk of 
PCa. Interestingly, regarding the type of wine, moderate consumption of white wine increased 
the risk of PCa, whereas moderate consumption of red wine had a protective effect. Further 
analyses are needed to assess the differential molecular effect of white and red wine conferring 
their impact on PCa risk.

Introduction
Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among men in the 
USA with an estimated 161,360 new cases in 2017.1 Worldwide, it is the second most 
common cancer and the sixth cause of cancer death among men,2 with an estimated 
1.1 million cases and 307,000 deaths in 2012.3 There are well-established risk fac-
tors for PCa, such as family history,4,5 hereditary genes,6 racial/ethnic background 
(eg, African ethnicity),7 and age. Also, a wide variety of exogenous/environmental/
lifestyle factors have been shown to impact the risk of PCa development and progres-
sion.8 For example, alcohol intake has been recently suggested as a risk factor for PCa

development in a meta-analysis that included 27 studies 
showing a significant dose–response relationship between 
the level of alcohol intake and the risk of PCa.9 On the other 
hand, a large prospective European cohort study failed to 
observe an association between alcohol consumption and 
PCa risk.10 Both studies did not assess the type of alcohol 
consumption. Despite association between alcohol intake and 
PCa risk, the effect of wine consumption on PCa risk is not 
yet fully understood. Furthermore, association between wine 
consumption and risk of PCa demands further investigation 
as several studies have suggested that polyphenols from red 
wine have a chemoprotective role in PCa cell lines.11,12
Therefore, we hypothesized that wine, specifically red 
wine, has a protective effect on PCa development. To test 
this hypothesis, we performed a meta-analysis assessing the 
effect of moderate wine consumption on PCa in a first step 
and then that of red and white wine differentially. 
Materials and methods
A systematic search of Web of Science, Medline/PubMed, 
and Cochrane library was performed using the terms “wine” 
and “prostate cancer” on December 1, 2017. All original 
articles that fulfilled the inclusion criteria were included. 
We performed additional cross-checking of reference lists, 
including those of previous meta-analyses and “hand-
searched” for additional references in the selected articles, 
reviews, and meta-analyses reporting on the topic.
Informed consent was not required for this type of study.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
The PICOS (Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome 
and Study design approach was utilized to define study 
eligibility according to the Preferred Reporting Items for 
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) criteria 
(www.prisma-statement.org).13 Studies were considered 
eligible if they assessed the risk of PCa due to red and white 
wine and wine in general using multivariable logistic regres-
sion analysis in the general population or compared with a 
control group of individuals without PCa. For each selected 
study, the following items were recorded: first author’s name, 
year of publication, country, number of patients, age, and 
variables used in the multivariable analysis, risk ratios (RRs) 
of PCa in multivariable analysis, dose of wine and follow-
up in case of cohort studies. Two independent investigators 
(MDV and SK) assessed study quality using the Newcastle-
Ottawa Scale (NOS)14 for cohort studies. A total score of 5 or 
less was considered low; 6–7 was considered intermediate, 
and 8–9 was considered high quality. Most included studies 
had intermediate and high quality score according to NOS 
(Figure S1). 
Statistical analysis
We performed a formal meta-analysis for the risk of PCa 
according to moderate wine consumption and moderate 
consumption of type of wine (white or red). RRs with their 
95% CIs from each study were used to calculate pooled RRs. 
Pooled estimates were calculated with the fixed effect model, 
if no significant heterogeneity was identified; alternatively, 
the random effect model was used when significant hetero-
geneity was detected. Statistical heterogeneity was defined 
based on Cochrane’s Q p-value or I2 statistics. We performed 
“leave-one-out” sensitivity analysis. To evaluate publication 
bias, Egger linear regression and funnel plots were examined. 
In case of reporting only RRs for low- and high-risk PCa, 
we included in the meta-analysis the RRs for high-risk PCa. 
Statistical analyses were performed using Stata 11.0 statisti-
cal software (Stata Corp., College Station, TX, USA).
Results
A total of 930 abstracts and titles were initially identi-
fied. After removal of duplicates, reviews, and conference 
abstracts, 83 full-text original articles were screened. Finally, 
17 studies (a total of 611,169 subjects) were included for 
final evaluation fulfilling the inclusion criteria.15–31 The 
PRISMA flow chart summarizing the process of study 
selection is shown in Figure 1. Potential publication bias 
was examined by both a funnel plot and an Egger’s test and 
we did not find any publication bias (Figure 2). Assessment 
of the main studies biases are shown in the risk bias table 
(Figure S2).
Effect of moderate consumption of wine 
on PCa risk 
Overall, 14 studies (455,413 subjects) fulfilled the inclusion 
criteria regarding moderate wine consumption and risk of 
PCa (6 cohort and 8 case–control studies).15–22,24,26,27,29–31 The 
main characteristics of the studies, as well as dose of wine 
consumption, are shown in Table 1. In the first meta-analysis, 
we included all the studies regardless of design. The pooled 
RR for the risk of PCa was 0.98 (95% CI 0.92–1.05, p=0.57) 
in the multivariable analysis (Figure 3). The Cochrane’s Q 
test (χ2=17.6; p=0.19) and I2 test (I2=23.8%) did not show 
a significant heterogeneity. The funnel plots identified 
one study over the pseudo 95% CI (Figure 2A). Further-
more, we performed a second meta-analysis in which we 
included only cohort studies (438,302 subjects from which

19,238 developed PCa during observation/follow-up). The 
results were confirmed with a pooled RR of 1.06 (95% CI 
0.96–1.15, p=0.22) in the multivariable analysis (Figure 4). 
The Cochrane’s Q test (χ2=1.9; p=0.86) and I2 test (I2=0%) 
did not show a significant heterogeneity. The funnel plots 
identified all studies in the pseudo 95% CI (Figure 2B). The 
results did not differ when we performed a sensitivity analysis 
“leave-one-out.”
Effect of the type of wine consumed on 
PCa risk 
Five studies investigated the risk of PCa according to con-
sumption of white or red wine. We used RRs reported for 
moderate consumption (the same dose for white and red 
wine was considered). Four were cohort studies (222,447 
subjects, from which 6,184 developed PCa during observa-
tion/follow-up)16,23,25,28 and one was a case–control study.22

Impact of moderate wine consumption on the risk of PCa
The main characteristics of the included studies, as well as 
dose of wine consumption, are shown in Table 2 for white 
wine and in Table 3 for red wine. Moderate white wine con-
sumption increased significantly the risk of PCa with a pooled 
RR of 1.26 (95% CI 1.10–1.43, p=0.001) in the multivariable 
analysis (Figure 5). The Cochrane's Q test (χ2=4.6; p=0.2) and 
I2 test (I2=34.4%) did not show a significant heterogeneity. 
The funnel plots identified all studies in the pseudo 95% CI 
(Figure 2C). When we excluded from the analysis the results 
reported by Sutcliffe et al,25 moderate white wine consump-
tion was not associated with an increased risk of PCa: pooled 
RR 1.05 (95% CI 0.87–1.28, p=0.56). In all the other cases 
of exclusion, one study from the analysis showed that white 
wine was associated with an increased risk of Pca.
Moderate red wine consumption was associated with a 
decreased risk of PCa with a pooled RR of 0.88 (95% CI 
0.78–0.999, p=0.047) in the multivariable analysis ( 
Figure 6). 
The Cochrane's Q test (χ2=2.16; p=0.53) and I2 test (I2=0%) 
did not show a significant heterogeneity. The funnel plots 
identified all studies in the pseudo 95% CI (Figure 2D). 
The results remain significant also after the addition of the 
RRs from the case–control study of Schoonen et al22 with a 
pooled RR of 0.86 (95% CI 0.76–0.97, p=0.01). However, 
in this case the heterogeneity increased, but not to a signifi-
cant level, Cochrane's Q test (χ2=6.06; p=0.19) and I2 test 
(I2=34%). When we excluded from the analysis the results 
reported by Sutcliffe et al,25 moderate red wine consumption 
was not associated with a decreased risk of PCa: pooled RR

Discussion
This study is to our knowledge the first meta-analysis to 
investigate the impact of moderate wine consumption and 
the risk of developing PCa, including 611,169 subjects 
from 17 studies. According to this meta-analysis moderate 
wine consumption is not a risk factor for PCa development. 
Interestingly, the analysis regarding type of wine consumed 
sustains the fact that moderate wine consumption does not 
impact PCa risk. We found an antagonist effect as moderate 
white wine consumption increases the risk of PCa, whereas 
moderate red wine consumption had a protective role against 
PCa. However, when we excluded the results reported by 
Sutcliffe et al25 (45,433 subjects with 16 years follow-up), 
there was not a significant association between type of wine 
consumed and risk of PCa. 
Nevertheless, our meta-analysis has several limitations. 
First, there is a selection bias in the studies as all were 
 
nonrandomized observational or case–control studies. Sec-
ond, the definition of moderate consumption is imprecise 
with differences between studies introducing heterogeneous 
results. Still, all studies had a maximum of one glass of wine 
per day as moderate consumption. Third, despite a large 
number of patients in our analyses, the number of studies 
in our meta-analysis was limited to 17. Fourth, most studies 
were done in western countries with a likely preponderance 
of  
Caucasians. Metabolization and polymorphisms are highly 
variable between races and habits. Fifth, we decided to restrict 
the present meta-analysis to “moderate consumption” of wine 
alone, thus precluding analyses of dose–response relation-
ship. We analyzed only the effect of moderate consumption; 
as in many countries, there are dietary habits that include 
one glass of wine per day during meals and the scope of the 
meta-analysis was not to encourage alcohol/wine consump-
tion, but instead to point out the effects of responsible wine 
drinking on the risk of PCa. 
The relationship between alcohol consumption and 
the risk of PCa remains a controversial issue.32 Middleton 
Fillmore et al demonstrated in a meta-analysis that heavy 
alcohol consumption is associated with a higher risk of 
developing PCa.33 Similarly, Zhao et al’s meta-analysis 
showed a significant dose–response relationship between 
level of alcohol intake and risk of PCa.9 On the contrary, a 
large prospective European study that included 142,607 male 
participants found no association between alcohol consump-
tion and PCa risk.10 Regarding types of alcohol consumption, 
in a large cohort of 3,927 subjects, Demoury et al showed 
that beer was associated with a 37% increase risk of high-
grade PCa.30 In the present study, we found that wine is not 
associated with an increased risk of PCa as other alcohol or 
beer consumption is. This could be based on several factors 
that make wine less harmful than other types of alcohols. 
One of the factors might be the chemical composition of 
wine, which is a hydroalcoholic solution (~78% water) with 
a wide range of bioactive chemical components, including

aldehydes, esters, ketones, lipids, minerals, organic acids, 
phenolics, soluble proteins, sugars, and vitamins.34 Second, 
the anticarcinogenic effect of polyphenols mainly contained 
by red wine may balance any other harmful effects of wine 
consumption.35 Third, in the case of beer, the bioavailability 
of the phenolic compounds is very low, thus decreasing their 
potential anticarcinogenic effects.36
Furthermore, the mechanism between alcohol consump-
tion and carcinogenesis is not fully understood. It seems to 
be based on acetaldehyde, the first metabolite of ethanol that 
has been suggested to be carcinogenic by promoting cancer 
development though various mechanisms, such as interfer-
ence with DNA replication, induction of DNA damage, and 
formation of DNA adducts.37 However, wine consumption, 
especially red wine, has been associated with decreased 
inflammation and overall mortality as well as moderate 
alcohol consumption.10,38 Schoonen et al22 and Sutcliffe et al25 
found, in large cohort studies, that red wine consumption 
decreases the risk of PCa, whereas white wine does not. Red 
wine’s protective role against PCa development could be due 
to the bioactivity of polyphenols that are a complex mixture 
of flavonoids (such as anthocyanins and flavan-3-ols) and 
nonflavonoids (such as resveratrol, cinnamates, and gallic 
acid). Resveratrol is the most studied compound and its 
concentration is 10-fold higher than in white wine.39 Resve-
ratrol is added from the skin of red grapes during the creation 
process. Its concentration in red wine ranges from 1.2 to 
 
2.0 g/L.39 It has been studied regarding its anticarcinogenesis 
including PCa, and many studies showed that resveratrol 
causes cell growth, proliferation inhibition, and activation of 
apoptosis in human PCa cell lines including PC3, DU145, 
and LNCaP
.40–43 Sgambato et al found that resveratrol not only 
inhibits cell proliferation but also prevents the accumulation 
of reactive oxygen species production and oxidative DNA 
damage in cells exposed to oxidative agents.44 On the other 
hand, white wine contains also a small amount of resveratrol, 
but despite an experimental study that showed an association 
between white wine and antiproliferative effect, clinical stud-
ies do not support this finding.43 Nevertheless, the beneficial 
effects of moderate red wine consumption might be due to 
all its compounds and not only due to resveratrol.39Although 
we focused only on “moderate” consumption of red wine 
in this study, it is unclear whether effectiveness of red wine 
polyphenols depends on the amount of consumption or not. 
To better assess the relationship between wine consumption, 
especially the appropriate amount of red wine and PCa risk 
in the general population, further studies are needed. 
Conclusion
In this meta-analysis, moderate wine consumption did not 
influence the risk of PCa. However, moderate consumption 
of white wine increased the risk of PCa, whereas moder-
ate consumption of red wine had a protective role. This 
hypothesis-generating data should serve as a rationale for 
uncovering the molecular underpinnings of this differential 
effect in order to potentially devise prevention strategies in 
the at-risk population.

Clinical Epidemiology is an international, peer-reviewed, open access, 
online journal focusing on disease and drug epidemiology, identifica-
tion of risk factors and screening procedures to develop optimal pre-
ventative initiatives and programs. Specific topics include: diagnosis, 
prognosis, treatment, screening, prevention, risk factor modification, 
 
systematic reviews, risk and safety of medical interventions, epidemiol-
ogy and biostatistical methods, and evaluation of guidelines, translational 
 
medicine, health policies and economic evaluations. The manuscript 
management system is completely online and includes a very quick 
and fair peer-review system, which is all easy to use.
