Dexmedetomidine for Sepsis in Intensive Care Unit Randomized Evaluation (DESIRE) Trial Investigators
IMPORTANCE Dexmedetomidine provides sedation for patients undergoing ventilation;
however, its effects on mortality and ventilator-free days have not been well studied among
patients with sepsis.
OBJECTIVES To examine whether a sedation strategy with dexmedetomidine can improve
clinical outcomes in patients with sepsis undergoing ventilation.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Open-label, multicenter randomized clinical trial
conducted at 8 intensive care units in Japan from February 2013 until January 2016
among 201 consecutive adult patients with sepsis requiring mechanical ventilation
for at least 24 hours.
INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomized to receive either sedation with dexmedetomidine
(n = 100) or sedation without dexmedetomidine (control group; n = 101). Other agents used
in both groups were fentanyl, propofol, and midazolam.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The co–primary outcomes were mortality and
ventilator-free days (over a 28-day duration). Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score
(days 1, 2, 4, 6, 8), sedation control, occurrence of delirium and coma, intensive care unit stay
duration, renal function, inflammation, and nutrition state were assessed as secondary
outcomes.
RESULTS Of the 203 screened patients, 201 were randomized. The mean age was 69 years
(SD, 14 years); 63% were male. Mortality at 28 days was not significantly different in the
dexmedetomidine group vs the control group (19 patients [22.8%] vs 28 patients [30.8%];
hazard ratio, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.38-1.22; P = .20). Ventilator-free days over 28 days were not
significantly different between groups (dexmedetomidine group: median, 20 [interquartile
range, 5-24] days; control group: median, 18 [interquartile range, 0.5-23] days; P = .20). The
dexmedetomidine group had a significantly higher rate of well-controlled sedation during
mechanical ventilation (range, 17%-58% vs 20%-39%; P = .01); other outcomes were not
significantly different between groups. Adverse events occurred in 8 (8%) and 3 (3%)
patients in the dexmedetomidine and control groups, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients requiring mechanical ventilation,
the use of dexmedetomidine compared with no dexmedetomidine did not result in
statistically significant improvement in mortality or ventilator-free days. However, the study
may have been underpowered for mortality, and additional research may be needed to
evaluate this further.

exmedetomidine, a highly selective α2-adrenergic
agonist, is a unique sedative agent compared with
γ-aminobutyric acid receptor agonists. Dexmedeto-
midinecanimprovepatients’abilitytocommunicatepaincom-
pared with midazolam and propofol. Therefore, dexmedeto-
midine is likely to be useful for light sedation.1 The analgesic
effects of dexmedetomi-
dine or the reduction of
other deliriogenic seda-
tives may lessen both agi-
tation and delirium.2
Furthermore, several
studies have shown that
dexmedetomidine can
suppressinflammatoryre-
actions and protect or-
gans in both animals and
humans.3-7 Particularly,
the Maximizing Efficacy of Targeted Sedation and Reducing
Neurological Dysfunction (MENDS) randomized clinical trial
showed in a subgroup analysis that patients with sepsis treated
withdexmedetomidinehadanimproved28-daymortalityrate
compared with those receiving lorazepam.8
Therefore, it was hypothesized that dexmedetomidine
wouldimprovepatient-orientedoutcomesamongpatientswith
sepsis. The Dexmedetomidine for Sepsis in Intensive Care Unit
(ICU) Randomized Evaluation (DESIRE) trial was conducted to
evaluate whether a sedation strategy with dexmedetomidine
would improve mortality and ventilator-free days during the
28 days after the initiation of ventilation among ICU patients
with sepsis.
Methods
Study Design
The DESIRE trial was an investigator-initiated, multicenter,
open-label randomized clinical trial conducted among
patients who had sepsis requiring mechanical ventilation for
more than 24 hours. The trial was designed to assess the
effects of a sedation strategy with dexmedetomidine on mor-
tality and ventilator-free days during the 28-day period after
initiation of ventilation. The trial was conducted in 8 ICUs in
Japan. The first patient was enrolled in February 2013 and
the trial was completed in January 2016. This study was
approved by the institutional review boards of Wakayama
Medical University and each participating institution. Written
informed consent was obtained from patients or patients’
families before randomization. Patients did not receive a sti-
pend for participation in this trial. The study protocol is avail-
able in Supplement 1.
Patients
Patients who were aged 20 years or older, had sepsis, and
needed mechanical ventilation for at least 24 hours (at the dis-
cretion of ICU physicians) were eligible for the study. Mechani-
cal ventilation included both invasive and noninvasive ven-
tilation (ie, ventilation with a nasal mask, face mask, head
mask, or cuirass). Sepsis was defined as systemic inflamma-
tory response syndrome due to infection.9 Because fluid re-
suscitation and antisepsis treatments are necessary for acute
pancreatitis (similar to an infection), cases of acute pancreati-
tiswereincludedasaninfectionwhereascasesofburnsorheat-
stroke were not. Soft tissue infection including necrotizing fas-
ciitis and Fournier gangrene were considered to take unusually
longer treatment for debridement in the ICU. Patients were ex-
cluded if they (1) had severe chronic liver disease (Child-Pugh
gradeBorC);(2)hadacutemyocardialinfarctionorsevereheart
failure (New York Heart Association functional class 4);
(3) had drug dependence or alcoholism or a psychological ill-
ness or severe cognitive dysfunction; or (4) were pregnant or
lactating or were allergic to dexmedetomidine. Detailed in-
clusion and exclusion criteria are provided in the trial proto-
col (Supplement 1).
Randomization and Intervention
Eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive either the
sedation strategy with dexmedetomidine or the sedation strat-
egy without dexmedetomidine (control group). Registration
anddatamanagementwereconductedusinganelectronicdata
capturing system. Randomization was conducted by per-
muted block randomization stratified by study center, pres-
ence of emergency surgery, chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, and soft tissue infection. The block size was 4 but
physicians and investigators were not notified of this during
the study.
Patients in the dexmedetomidine group received dexme-
detomidine and analgesia continuously, and other sedatives
were added as needed. Patients in the control group received
sedative drugs such as propofol, midazolam, and analgesia
without dexmedetomidine. The targets of sedation depth
were a Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) score of 0
(calm) during the day and a RASS score of −2 (lightly sedated)
during the night in both groups.10 Sedation was maintained
throughout the duration of mechanical ventilation or as
needed. The sedation protocols were also in compliance with
the Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Sustained Use of Seda-
tives and Analgesics in the Critically Ill Adult.11 The detailed
sedation protocol is available in eFigure 1 in Supplement 2.

Key Points
Question Does a sedation strategy with dexmedetomidine
compared with no dexmedetomidine improve ventilator-free days
and mortality among patients with sepsis requiring ventilation?
Findings In this randomized clinical trial that included 201 adults,
treatment with dexmedetomidine compared with treatment
without dexmedetomidine did not significantly improve
ventilator-free days (20 days vs 18 days) or 28-day mortality
(23% vs 31%; hazard ratio, 0.69).
Meaning Treatment with dexmedetomidine in patients
with sepsis did not improve either ventilator-free days
or 28-day mortality.

Intensive Care Medicine.12 Enteral feeding was provided ac-
cording to our protocols.
Primary and Secondary Outcomes
The co–primary outcomes were 28-day mortality and
ventilator-free days. In the original protocol, we planned to as-
sess the duration of ventilation as a co–primary outcome. Be-
cause duration of mechanical ventilation was highly influ-
enced by mortality, the number of 28-day ventilator-free days
was set as the co–primary end point instead on May 2, 2015,
before obtaining outcome data. Ventilator-free days were cal-
culated in the first 28 days or the days alive minus days
under mechanical ventilation after randomization. Patients
were weaned from mechanical ventilation with a spontane-
ous breathing trial procedure if they met the predefined cri-
teria, including improvement of the underlying illness, a par-
tial pressure of arterial oxygen of more than 60 mm Hg with
a fraction of inspired oxygen of less than 0.5 and a positive
end-expiratory pressure of less than 8 cm H2O, a normal
partial pressure of carbon dioxide, and sufficient spontane-
ous inspiration. The full ventilator-weaning criteria are de-
scribed in the trial protocol (Supplement 1). Secondary out-
comes included length of ICU stay and length of hospital stay
(days); RASS score; Confusion Assessment Method for ICU
Patients (CAM-ICU) score; Sequential Organ Failure Assess-
ment (SOFA) score13; disseminated intravascular coagulation
score (as defined by the Japanese Association for Acute
Medicine14); a score comprising Mini-Mental State Examina-
tion (MMSE) score at hospital discharge, serum urea nitrogen
andcreatininelevels,estimatedglomerularfiltrationrate,daily
urinary output, requirement for renal replacement therapy,
C-reactive protein and procalcitonin levels, daily energy in-
take by enteral nutrition, and prealbumin level. The RASS
is a distinctive scale for the degree of sedation or agitation;
thus, it cannot be evaluated with means or medians. Well-
controlled sedation was defined as an RASS score between −3
and +1 throughout 1 day spent in the ICU and was defined as
(rate of controlled sedation) = (patient’
s number of days with
well-controlledsedation)/(totalnumberofpatientsintheICU),
calculated for each day. Coma was defined as an RASS score
between−4and−5throughout1dayintheICU.Therateofdays
with well-controlled sedation and days free from delirium or
coma were set as post hoc analyses. Predefined adverse events
included any arrhythmias and myocardial ischemia such as
acute coronary syndrome during sedation.
Statistical Analyses
To estimate the sample size, we assumed the 28-day survival
to be 80% in the dexmedetomidine group and 60% in the
control group based on the results of the MENDS randomized
controlled trial, which showed that the 28-day survival was
84% among the group receiving dexmedetomidine and 59%
among the control group.8 The study needed 172 patients to
achieve 80% power with a 2-sided α level of .05. A 15% drop-
out or withdrawal rate was estimated and 200 patients were
planned for enrollment.
Clinical outcomes were analyzed according to the
intention-to-treat principle. All time-to-event data were cen-
sored at 28 days. Missing data were analyzed without impu-
tation, but there were no missing data of observations during
the ICU stay. Continuous variables were presented as means
with standard deviations or medians with interquartile ranges
(IQRs), and categorical variables were shown as numbers
and percentages.
Because there were 2 co–primary end points, both com-
parisons had to meet significance to determine the efficacy of
treatment. The cumulative incidence was estimated by the
Kaplan-Meier method, and differences between the groups
were assessed by the log-rank test. We used the Cox propor-
tionalhazardsmodeltoestimatethehazardratio(HR)and95%
confidence interval of the dexmedetomidine group com-
pared with the control group. Proportional hazard assump-
tions for the variables were assessed on the plots of log(time)
vs log(−log [survival]) stratified by the variables, and the as-
sumptions were verified to be acceptable. To compare other
clinical outcomes between the dexmedetomidine group and
the control group, χ2 tests or Fisher exact tests were used for
categorical variables and t tests or Wilcoxon rank sum tests for
continuous variables based on the distribution.
To examine the effect of dexmedetomidine on sedation
control and the occurrence of delirium and coma, a general-
izedlinearmodel(GENMODprocedurewithlogitfunction)was
used to account for repeated measurements in the same pa-
tient. We included the status of patients in the dependent vari-
able and treatment allocation in the independent variable with
a repeated variable of patient.
The Cox proportional hazard models were constructed in
prespecifiedsubgroups:age(≥65vs<65yearsold),AcutePhysi-
ology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) scores
(≥23 vs <23),15 shock on admission (presence vs absence), and
site of infection (thorax, abdomen, etc). Shock was defined
as a circulatory SOFA score of 3 or higher. The threshold of
APACHE II score was determined by the median value. To es-
timate P values for interaction, Cox proportional hazards
models with variables of outcomes, subgroup factor, and the
interaction variables in addition to allocation factors were con-
structed.Wealsoconstructedthesameanalysesincludingstudy
center as a stratification variable because management of sep-
sis might be different between centers. Because this stratifica-
tion variable was not predetermined, the analyses adjusted for
study center were considered post hoc sensitivity analyses.
All statistical analyses were conducted by an indepen-
dent statistician who was masked to treatment group alloca-
tion. All statistical analyses were performed using JMP,
version 11.2.0 (SAS Institute Inc), and SAS, version 9.4 (SAS
Institute Inc). A 2-sided P<.05 was considered statistically sig-
nificant. The statistical analysis plan for the study is available
in Supplement 3.
Results
A total of 203 ventilated patients with sepsis were initially en-
rolled and 2 patients were excluded (1 declined to participate
and 1 had liver cirrhosis). Two hundred one patients were
randomized either into the dexmedetomidine group (n = 100)

or the control group (n = 101) (Figure 1). The patients’back-
grounds, severity of illness, comorbidities, and site of infec-
tion were similar between groups (Table 1).
The cumulative incidence of death at 28 days was 22.8%
(n=19) in the dexmedetomidine group and 30.8% (n=28) in the
control group (P = .20) (Figure 2). The HR of the dexmedeto-
midine group was 0.69 (95% CI, 0.38-1.22; P = .20). The re-
sult of sensitivity analysis adjusting the center was similar (HR,
0.65; 95% CI, 0.36-1.16; P = .15). The median number of 28-
day ventilator-free days in the dexmedetomidine group was
20 (IQR, 5-24) compared with 18 (IQR, 0.5-23) in the control
group (P = .20). The number of ventilator days was 6 (IQR, 3-11)
in the dexmedetomidine group and 6 (IQR, 3-11] in the con-
trol group (P = .64). Median length of ICU stay was 7 (IQR, 4-12)
days in the dexmedetomidine group and 8 (IQR, 4-14) days in
the control group (P = .43).

score between groups (Table 2). The rate of well-controlled se-
dation during ICU stay was significantly higher in the dexme-
detomidine group than in the control group (range, 17%-58%
vs 20%-39%; P = .01), while the rate of delirium- and coma-
free days was not significantly different between groups
(P = .17) (Figure 3). The frequency and dose of propofol and
midazolam were lower in the dexmedetomidine group than
in the control group, but the frequency and dose of fentanyl
were not significantly different (eTable 1 in Supplement 2).
The subgroup analyses did not show any heterogeneity in
the effect of dexmedetomidine on mortality in terms of age
older than 65 years, presence of shock on admission, or site
of infection (eFigure 2 in Supplement 2). In the subgroup with
APACHE II scores of 23 or higher, the dexmedetomidine group
was associated with lower hospital mortality (HR, 0.39; 95%
CI, 0.16-0.91; P = .03).
Secondary outcomes included C-reactive protein, pro-
calcitonin, and prealbumin levels and disseminated intra-
vascular coagulation score. There was a significant differ-
ence only in C-reactive protein between the groups (eTable
2 in Supplement 2). The time taken to achieve a satisfactory
MMSE score (or proportion of time spent with a satisfactory
MMSE score) could not be reported because of insufficient
data obtained.
The observed adverse events included bradycardia in 7 pa-
tients (7%) in the dexmedetomidine group and in 2 patients
(2%) in the control group. Acute coronary syndrome was noted

Discussion
Inthisrandomizedclinicaltrialtoevaluatetheeffectofdexme-
detomidine on clinical outcomes in patients with sepsis under
ventilationandtoattempttoverifytheresultsofsubgroupanaly-
sis in the MENDS trial,8 administration of dexmedetomidine in
patientswithsepsisdidnotimprovemortalityorventilator-free
days but did achieve better control of light sedation.
The difference in results between this trial and the MENDS
study may be attributable to a number of factors. First, the
previous study was a subgroup analysis of patients with sep-
sis in the MENDS trial in which ventilated ICU patients were
randomized to receive dexmedetomidine or lorazepam; sec-
ond, this trial was a randomized clinical trial of patients with
sepsis undergoing ventilation and receiving vs not receiving
dexmedetomidine; third, the administered dexmedetomi-
dine dosage in the trial was less than the usual dosage in
other countries because of the lower dosage limit covered by
Japanesemedicalinsurance;andfourth,theparticipantsinthis
study were older (mean age of 68.8 vs 59.0 years) and their
APACHE II scores were lower (mean of 23.0 vs 29.5) than in
the MENDS subgroup analysis.
The study may have identified a clinically important
benefit of dexmedetomidine—an 8% reduction in 28-day
mortality—that did not demonstrate statistical significance.
The trial was prospectively powered to detect a 20% differ-
ence in 28-day survival based on the results of the MENDs
subgroup analysis. Physicians may consider an 8% differ-
ence in 28-day mortality to be clinically significant but this
study was underpowered to detect this difference.

temic sedation protocol and early physical therapy including
a ventilator-weaning protocol in the ICU can improve de-
lirium and prognosis.18-22 In the current study, with system-

tocol might have been more effective than drug choice for
reducing delirium.
Moreover, it was hypothesized that dexmedetomidine
can improve prognosis by suppressing the hypersympathetic
condition in sepsis. High plasma catecholamine levels seem
to be harmful to the human body in critically ill patients.23-26

in patients with sepsis.27 In another study, heart rate control
with esmolol, a typical β1-adrenoceptor blockade, was shown
to reduce norepinephrine requirements, resulting in an
improvement in 28-day survival.28 Moreover, even the small-
est dose of dexmedetomidine suppresses both endogenous
norepinephrine and epinephrine in a healthy human body.29
From these reports, it was considered that dexmedetomidine
and β1-adrenoceptor blockade could have a similar effect on
improving mortality in patients with sepsis.
A new definition of sepsis was announced in February
2016.30 Owing to the inclusion criteria used in this study, the
study enrolled patients with more severe sepsis than speci-
fied in the new definition because patients with sepsis who
needed mechanical ventilation were included. Therefore, the
findings should be applicable to patients with sepsis as de-
fined by the new definition.
There are several limitations in this study. First, this
was an open-label study and the end points were assessed
by physicians at discharge. However, mortality was less likely
influenced by physicians’judgment, and the criteria for wean-
ing from mechanical ventilation were set prior to the study.
Theeventadjudicationcommitteealsoverifiedassessmentand
the use of sedative drugs or other interventions for sepsis. The
RASS and CAM-ICU were assessed by nurses who were not
blinded to the allocation, but they assessed patients based on
a manual irrespective of the study. Therefore, the influence of
unblinding should be small. Second, the sample size was not
large enough to detect the 8% difference in 28-day mortality
as a result. We estimated the sample size based on the MENDS
subgroup trial, which showed 16% and 41% mortality (a 25%
difference). Third, although long-term outcomes are impor-
tant in this area of research, only short-term outcomes were
analyzed in this study. Further studies with long observation
periods are warranted.
In this study, only 203 patients were screened and 201 en-
rolled. The number of patients screened but not enrolled was
small for a general clinical trial. In Japan, clinicians ascertain
the inclusion and exclusion criteria and decide to offer enroll-
ment. Therefore, patients were screened and enrolled at the
same time; there was 1 case excluded for liver cirrhosis before
allocation.
Conclusions
Among patients requiring mechanical ventilation, the use of
dexmedetomidine compared with no dexmedetomidine did
not result in statistically significant improvement in mortal-
ity or ventilator-free days. However, the study may have
been underpowered for mortality, and additional research
may be needed to evaluate this further.

To examine the effect of dexmedetomidine on sedation control and the
occurrence of delirium and coma, a generalized linear model was used
accounting for repeated measurements in the same patient. Well-controlled
sedation was defined as a Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) score
between −3 and +1 throughout 1 day spent in the intensive care unit (ICU) and
was defined as (rate of controlled sedation) = (patient’
s number of days with
well-controlled sedation)/(total number of patients in the ICU), calculated for
each day. Coma was defined as an RASS score between −4 and −5 throughout 1
day in the ICU. Day 1 is defined as the first day of randomization into the trial.
