Abstract 
Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of oral glucosamine in subgroups of people with hip or knee 
osteoarthritis (OA) based on baseline pain severity, BMI, sex, structural abnormalities and presence 
of inflammation, using individual patient data. 
Methods: After a systematic search of the literature and clinical trial registries, all randomized 
controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effect of any oral glucosamine substance in patients with 
clinically or radiographically defined hip or knee OA were contacted. As a minimum, pain, age, sex 
and BMI at baseline and pain as an outcome measure needed to be assessed. 
Results: Of 21 eligible studies, six (N=1663) shared their trial data with the OA Trial Bank. Five trials 
(all independent of industry, N=1625) compared glucosamine to placebo, representing 55% of the 
total number of participants in all published placebo-controlled RCTs. Glucosamine was no better 
than placebo for pain or function at short (3 months) and long-term (24 months) follow-up. 
Glucosamine was also no better than placebo among the predefined subgroups. Stratification for 
knee OA and type of glucosamine did not alter these results.  
Conclusions: Although proposed and debated for several years, open trial data are not widely made 
available for studies of glucosamine for OA, especially those sponsored by industry. Currently there is 
no good evidence to support the use of glucosamine for hip or knee OA and an absence of evidence 
to support specific consideration of glucosamine for any clinically relevant OA subgroup according to 
baseline pain severity, BMI, sex, structural abnormalities, or presence of inflammation.

Introduction 
Oral glucosamine has long been recommended for the treatment of knee and hip osteoarthritis (OA). 
However, recent guidelines by OARSI 1 and NICE 2 highlight the lack of support for the efficacy of oral 
glucosamine for the management of symptoms or disease modification in OA 3. With increasing study 
quality over the past decades, reported effect sizes for glucosamine have decreased 4. Furthermore, 
methodological issues in trials studying the effect of glucosamine for OA symptoms, such as 
inadequate allocation concealment and absence of intention-to-treat analyses, has resulted in 
overestimation of its effectiveness 5. A network meta-analysis from 7 high-quality, large (>200 
participants per trial) randomized controlled trials (RCTs) concluded that oral glucosamine was not 
superior to placebo in reducing OA pain or reduction in joint space narrowing3.  
Notwithstanding the overall lack of efficacy of glucosamine, it is possible that certain subgroups of 
OA might respond differently (either better or worse) to any specific treatment 6. These subgroups 
might be based on different pathologies underlying the clinical presentation of OA, different disease 
stages, or on the presence of different co-morbidities 6. Accordingly, clinical guidelines increasingly 
call for the identification of any predictors of response to different treatment modalities 7. Since the 
effectiveness of glucosamine varies among different populations 4, 5, 8, it is possible that glucosamine 
might show higher efficacy when targeted at specific subgroups. 
Recently, van Middelkoop et al. 9 reported on the methodology and legal structure to perform 
individual patient data (IPD) meta-analyses to identify clinically relevant subgroups that may show 
differential response to different OA treatments (the OA Trial Bank). The proposed methodologically 
robust method tests subgroup-treatment interaction effects using IPD from multiple published trials 
and allows for adjustment for confounding at both study and individual patient levels 9. Using this 
method, increased short-term efficacy for glucocorticoid treatment among knee OA patients with 
more severe pain has been demonstrated 10. 
The present study aimed to collect IPD of all RCTs performed for oral glucosamine in people with 
knee and hip OA to evaluate the efficacy within predefined subgroups of OA based on pain severity, 
BMI, sex, structural abnormalities and presence of inflammation.  
Methods 
Systematic search 
To identify all available RCTs, a systematic search of the literature was performed in Pubmed, the 
Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, Web of Science, Cinahl and Scopus. The 
search strategy was based on the search protocol of the Cochrane publication on the effectiveness of 
glucosamine 8. It was adjusted for the different databases and limited to publications from 1994 
because of the likelihood of communicating with corresponding authors and data being available 
(searched up to March 2014 and available upon request). Reference lists were hand searched for 
further identification of published work. Additional potential on-going studies were searched for in 
clinical trial registries.  
Two authors (JR and RR) independently selected citations based on titles and abstracts. Subsequently 
full articles were obtained for those citations thought to fulfil the inclusion criteria and were 
independently assessed by the two review authors. A third review author was consulted if consensus 
was not reached (MvM). No protocol was registered for the current project, but full protocol details 
for the systematic review and the IPD meta-analysis were pre specified in the data delivery license 
 5. 
 
agreement, that was approved by all members of the OA Trial Bank Steering Committee before the 
systematic search of the literature was initiated (available upon request). 
Inclusion/exclusion criteria  
All RCTs evaluating the effect of any oral glucosamine substance in participants with knee or hip OA 
were included. This included studies testing the effects of glucosamine within a subgroup of 
participants with OA. Studies solely testing a combination of glucosamine with another substance 
(e.g. chondroitin) were not included. There was no language restriction. 
Participants 
Participants were men and/or women with a diagnosis of OA of the knee or hip:  
(1) according to ACR classification criteria 11, or 
(2) on the basis of detailed clinical and/or radiographic information. 
Studies including a subgroup of knee or hip OA patients were also included, because individual 
patient data were collected.  
Interventions 
All comparisons between different oral glucosamine doses or between different frequencies of 
intake were included. Co-interventions were allowed as long as they were identically applied to the 
glucosamine and control group.  
Comparator 
All comparisons between oral glucosamine and any placebo/medication/dietary supplement/other 
non-surgical treatment were included. 
Outcomes 
The minimum criterion for inclusion of RCTs was adequate reporting of pain as an outcome measure.  
Baseline predictors  
(1) Important data:  
As a minimum, severity of pain, age, sex and BMI should have been assessed at baseline in order to 
define subgroups. 
(2) If available: 
Signs of inflammation, either by physical examination (warmth, effusion) or by additional testing 
(ultrasound, MRI, biopsy, serum CRP/ESR), and structural abnormalities by radiography or magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI)at baseline.  
Data collection, transfer and checks 
All corresponding authors of eligible trials were approached and asked to share trial data (first by 
email, subsequently by telephone). When corresponding authors could not be reached, the other 
listed authors and the institutes in which the trials had been performed were contacted. All data-
deliverers willing to participate (i.e. the research institutes who own the data) were asked to sign the 
data delivery license agreement, including items on input data, obligations, ownership of data, terms, 
authorship, all subgroup analyses and publications. All anonymous data were transferred to a 
secured database at the Erasmus University Medical Center Rotterdam. Upon receiving the data, a 
thorough check of the data took place by reproducing the main baseline characteristics and the 
 6. 
 
reported changes over time for the available outcome measures. Uncertainties were resolved in 
collaboration with the trialists.  
Risk of Bias assessment 
The methodological quality of all included trials in the OA Trial Bank were assessed using the twelve 
criteria recommended by Cochrane (see supplementary Table S1) and were evaluated independently 
by two researchers (JR and RR). The criteria were scored as ‘yes’ (low risk of bias), ‘no’ (high risk of 
bias) or ‘unclear’. Any disagreement between the review authors was resolved by discussion, 
including input from a third review author (MvM). A study with a low risk of bias was defined as 
fulfilling six or more of the criteria items. In case the number of shared studies would allow proper 
interpretation (≥10 studies), funnel plots were considered for evaluation of publication bias.  
Data analyses 
Firstly, heterogeneity of the eligible studies was determined for the primary outcomes, using a 2-
stage meta-analysis approach in Review Manager 5.3. In case of high heterogeneity (I2 index > 50), 
sensitivity analyses without data from trials causing the heterogeneity were planned. Secondly, a 
descriptive comparison between studies was performed. We assumed missing data to be missing at 
random. Therefore missing data for covariates and outcome measures were imputed, using multiple 
imputation methods, within each original study. Outcomes measured on different scales were 
standardized in order to pool the data. Predefined subgroup factors were dichotomized, based on 
consensus of the OA Trial Bank Steering Committee. For this, descriptive statistics of the subgroup 
variables for each of the five trials were shared with the Steering Committee, together with proposed 
cut-off values, based on literature, data separation in the available trials and previous IPD meta-
analysis by the OA Trial Bank10. 
The primary outcome measures were pain severity in the short-term (3 to 6 months) and at long-
term (≥ 1 year) follow-up. Secondary outcomes were physical function and all forms of structural 
changes at these time points. 
A one-stage multilevel regression analysis was performed to estimate the magnitude of the effect 
(estimated pooled mean differences) of glucosamine over the control intervention over all included 
studies and in the different subgroups with the individuals nested within each study. A single 
covariate was added to the regression models to indicate the study (fixed factor), in order to adjust 
for possible residual confounding by study differences. To assess possible subgroup effects, a 
random-effects linear regression model was used to determine interaction effects. This model 
included the dependent variable (primary or secondary outcome measure), the independent variable 
(treatment group), the effect modifier (subgroup indicator), and an interaction term (independent 
variable x effect modifier). All analyses were adjusted for age sex, BMI, WOMAC pain at baseline and 
were performed with and without stratification for type of glucosamine and with and without 
stratification for the affected joint. Comparisons and subgroup analysis for which only one RCT was 
available were not taken into account, since main effects were already studied in the original 
publication and individual trials usually were not powered for subgroup analysis. A p-value < 0.05 
was regarded as statistically significant in all analyses, using IBM SPSS software version 22. 
Results 
The literature search resulted in 1377 abstracts. After screening, 58 publications were evaluated in 
full-text and 18 fulfilled all inclusion criteria 12-29, with two additional trials identified from the 
 7. 
 
references of the included trials 30, 31 (Figure 1). Searching the clinical trial registries resulted in one 
additional potentially eligible trial (NCT01074476). All 21 corresponding authors of these trials were 
contacted for participation. After multiple efforts to contact all data owners of the eligible trials, 
authors/institutes of six studies agreed to participate and delivered trial data to the OA Trial Bank14-16, 
24, 28, 29. Corresponding authors of two trials indicated that trial data were no longer available 13, 23. 
Two corresponding authors did reply positively to the initial request for data sharing, but a signed 
license agreement was never received 12, 20. One corresponding author was not interested in 
participation 17. No contact was established with any of the authors nor the research institutes of five 
studies 18, 21, 26, 30, 31 and the one study identified in the clinical trial registry. Four data owners 
indicated that they were not permitted to share their data by the study sponsor 19, 22, 25, 27. See Table 1 
for full details of all eligible studies. 
Five out of the six studies willing to participate involved knee OA participants 14-16, 24, 29, while only 
one involved hip OA participants 28. Follow-up duration in the six trials ranged from 3 to 24 months. 
Three studies evaluated glucosamine sulphate (GS) 15, 16, 28and two glucosamine hydrochloride (GH) 14, 
29. The publication of the remaining study stated that the first 163 subjects received GS, but that the 
subsequent subjects received GH 24. However, after extensive communication with the trial owner, 
the order of glucosamine type was deemed to be a typographical error, since the supplier of the 
glucosamine for the latter part of the participants (Rottapharm) is renowned for its GS. Data on 
participants within this trial were allocated to the stratified analysis for glucosamine type based upon 
this new insight of the glucosamine type provided. With the exception of the trial by Coulson et al. 
that used green-lipped mussel extract as comparison 15, all studies compared their glucosamine 
substrate against placebo. The trial by Coulson et al. was therefore not included in the subgroup 
analysis (mean change in WOMAC pain -1.6 [-3.7 to 0.6] on a 0 to 20 scale in favour of glucosamine [p 
= 0.157])15. The trial by Sawitzke et al.29 presented long-term follow-up from the Clegg et al.14, but 
since both publications report on different outcome measures of interest (clinical data and 
radiography vs. clinical data only) and risk of bias could be assessed for both publications separately, 
both were indicated as separate trials. No important issues were identified when checking shared 
trial data, but for the trial by McAlindon24 for which data of the first 199 (out of 205 in the original 
publication) could be retrieved by the trial owners. No relevant differences in baseline characteristics 
for the subjects with shared data and the published data were observed. Percentages of missing data 
for the main baseline characteristics and all outcome measures for each of the five individual trials 
are presented in supplementary Table S2. All listed variables were used in the multiple imputation by 
the SPSS software package, creating 20 imputed data sets for each trial. 
The five trials included in the analysis included a total number of 1625 participants (64% women), 
815 randomised to glucosamine and 810 to placebo. This reflected 55% of the participants 
randomized in the 17 published RCTs on glucosamine versus placebo. Pain was measured in all five 
studies using the ordinal WOMAC questionnaire 32. Scores were rescaled to a 0-100 scale and defined 
at short-term (closest to a minimal of 3 months follow-up) for the trials by McAlindon et al. 24, Clegg 
et al. 14, and Rozendaal et al. 28 and long-term (2 years follow-up) for Fransen et al. 16, Sawitzke et al. 
29, and Rozendaal et al. 28. Physical function was also measured in all five studies using the WOMAC 
questionnaire and was rescaled and defined in an identical matter. Figure 2 presents the overall 
mean differences of these five trials for the primary outcome at short and long-term, based on the 
imputed data sets.  
 8. 
 
The following subgroups were defined: WOMAC pain <70 vs. ≥70, BMI <27 kg/m2 vs. ≥27 kg/m2, 
Kellgren & Lawrence grade33 (KL) 0-2 vs. KL3-4, and presence vs. absence of inflammation. Presence 
of inflammation was defined as either presence of swelling/effusion on clinical examination14, 29 or an 
elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)28, defined as ESR ≥20 mm/h for men aged ≥50 years, 
ESR ≥15 mm/h for men aged <50 years, ESR ≥30 mm/h for women aged ≥50 years, and ESR ≥20 
mm/h for women aged <50 years. Inflammation data were only available when combining data from 
one knee OA14, 29 and one hip OA trial28. Therefore, no additional stratification was possible. Baseline 
Kellgren and Lawrence grades were only available in one knee OA trial with short-term outcomes 14, 
two knee OA trials with long-term outcomes 16, 29, and the one hip OA trial 28 with short and long-
term outcomes. Given this lack of consistency, stratification of the subgroup analysis was done for 
knee OA trials only on long-term outcomes. 
Risk of bias and heterogeneity 
All five studies were defined as having a low risk of bias (Table 2) and heterogeneity was low (I2 = 0 
for main effects on pain at short and I2 = 14 for long-term follow-up, see Figure 2), so no sensitivity 
analyses were performed. 
Overall intervention effects 
Estimated pooled differences for the primary and secondary outcome measures are presented in 
Table 3. No statistical significance main effects were found for glucosamine over placebo. 
Subgroup effects 
None of the interaction terms of the predefined subgroups reached statistical significance (see Table 
3). Estimated pooled differences within each subgroup for the primary outcomes over all eligible 
trials are presented in Figure 3. Within the stratified analyses among studies using GS for knee OA 
the number of subjects with high baseline pain was too small for the software to test the pooled 
interaction term for the baseline pain severity subgroup. 
Discussion 
To our knowledge, this is the first IPD meta-analysis to examine potential subgroup effects of oral 
glucosamine for people with OA. Within the 5 trials where the authors were willing to share their 
data, 1625 patients with knee or hip OA were analysed. This represents 55% of all available 
participants from the placebo controlled trials for this product. The main findings are: [1] overall, 
glucosamine was no better than placebo for both pain and function outcomes; [2] in subgroup 
analyses, glucosamine was no better than placebo according to baseline pain severity, BMI, gender, 
structural abnormalities, and presence of inflammation; and [3] the majority of trials were knee OA 
(4 trials, 1403 patients) and the analysis based on knee OA only had similar results.  
Several systematic reviews and network meta-analyses have shown that as the number of high-
quality and industry-independent studies on the effectiveness of glucosamine for OA increased over 
time, the results of earlier studies that showed beneficial effects of glucosamine were viewed as less 
credible3-5, 8, 34, 35. It is therefore not surprising that the present IPD meta-analysis also showed no 
significant main effects, especially since previous studies showed a low risk of bias to be associated 
with small, non-significant effect sizes for glucosamine over placebo 3, 8, 34 and the fact that all 
included studies had a low risk of bias. Present results of overall treatment effects within the trials 
that shared data and over the different stratifications ranged from -0.43 to 2.02 on the 0 to 100 
WOMAC pain scale, which is comparable to the overall treatment effects for industry independent 
 9. 
 
studies (0.1 [95% CI -0.2 to 0.5] for VAS pain on a 0 to 10 scale) presented by the meta-analyses of 
Wandel and colleagues3. In the literature, overall beneficial effects of treatment have been reported 
in studies using the glucosamine compound produced by Rottapharm 4, 5, 8, 34, however these trials 
were not made available to the study team for the current analyses.  
Extending previous initiatives, the present study also evaluated treatment effects of glucosamine 
over placebo for several clinically relevant subgroups of OA, made possible by the IPD from the 
collaborating trials. Despite the large number of participants incorporated in the IPD meta-analysis, 
none of the interaction terms reached statistical significance. The interactions with BMI among knee 
OA patients receiving GS on short-term function (p = 0.12) and on long-term pain (p = 0.10) were the 
only outcomes for which further research may be warranted. However, given the number of analyses 
performed in the study incidental findings are certainly possible.  
The currently used cut-off for the baseline pain severity subgroup is somewhat comparable to the 
strata used in the Clegg et al. study14 to test for different effects within subjects with mild pain 
(WOMAC pain scores 0 to 60) versus those with moderate to severe pain (WOMAC pain scores 60 to 
80). The Clegg et al. study was not powered to show subgroup effects, but the non-significant effects 
of glucosamine over placebo within both subgroups is corroborated by the present results. 
The current study has several limitations. Despite all efforts, data from only six of the 21 identified 
studies were acquired. Of those studies not included in the present study, the largest groups were 
those not responding to any of the requests for data sharing (6 studies) and those not permitted by 
the commercial study sponsor to share data (4 studies), see Table 1. Although missing data for the 
main baseline characteristics within the data shared with the OA Trial Bank were limited, multiple 
imputation methods were needed to deal with the missing data in the outcome measures that 
ranged from 2% to 46%. Within the trials that shared data, only a few measured the pre-defined 
subgroups based on structural abnormalities and presence of inflammation. The available data for 
these subgroups combined studies evaluating different glucosamine substances for different OA 
joints. Therefore, rigorous stratification of the analysis was not possible with the available data. 
Open access to data of clinical trials has been proposed and debated for several years36-38. 
Nevertheless our experience, in common with others, suggests that currently this is far from 
accepted practice39. Thus the full potential and use of completed clinical trials is not reached and only 
part of the clinical evidence is available to clinicians and patients, thus threatening the 
appropriateness of recommendations for clinical decision-making39. Once initiatives such as the OA 
Trial Bank, which appropriately use existing data for scientific purposes, become more established 
and generally accepted, authors and commercial parties involved in clinical research may become 
more confident in data sharing. The OA Trial Bank plans to update publications every five years and 
will again approach data owners that chose to not share their data to the OA Trial Bank in the first 
initiative. 
The aim of the present study was to perform an IPD meta-analysis on all available RCTs on 
glucosamine in people with OA. After performing the systematic search of the literature and clinical 
trial registers, it took 18 months to reach as many data owners as possible and to collect and check 
all data of those willing to deliver their trial data. For a systematic review, one might argue that an 
update of the search strategy is warranted. However, given the time-consuming efforts of sharing 
data between research institutes, this was not feasible for the present study.  
 10. 
 
In conclusion, the current IPD on the efficacy of glucosamine for subgroups of OA based on pain 
severity, BMI, sex, radiographic structural changes, and presence of inflammation, using data from 
55% of the participants available in literature and using data from low risk-of-bias trials only, did not 
identify a subgroup for which glucosamine showed any significant beneficial effects over placebo for 
pain or function in either the short- or long-term. Stratification only for participants with knee OA or 
for type of glucosamine did not result in any differences in outcomes. Therefore, currently there is no 
evidence to support the use of glucosamine for treatment of hip or knee OA in general, and an 
absence of evidence to support the use of glucosamine for clinically relevant subgroups of OA 
according to baseline pain severity, BMI, sex, structural abnormalities, and presence of inflammation.
