SUMMARY
Natural killer (NK) cells play a key role in innate immu-
nity by detecting alterations in self and non-self li-
gands via paired NK cell receptors (NKRs). Despite
identification of numerous NKR-ligand interactions,
physiological ligands for the prototypical NK1.1
orphan receptor remain elusive. Here, we identify
a viral ligand for the inhibitory and activating NKR-
P1 (NK1.1) receptors. This murine cytomegalovirus
(MCMV)-encoded protein, m12, restrains NK cell
effector function by directly engaging the inhibitory
NKR-P1B receptor. However, m12 also interacts
with the activating NKR-P1A/C receptors to counter-
balance m12 decoy function. Structural analyses
reveal that m12 sequesters a large NKR-P1 surface
area via a ‘‘polar claw’’ mechanism. Polymorphisms
in, and ablation of, the viral m12 protein and host
NKR-P1B/C alleles impact NK cell responses in vivo.
Thus, we identify the long-sought foreign ligand for
this key immunoregulatory NKR family and reveal
how it controls the evolutionary balance of immune
recognition during host-pathogen interplay.
INTRODUCTION
Natural killer (NK) cells are a subset of innate lymphoid cells (ILC)
capable of recognizing an array of pathological target cells. As
efficient sentinels responsible for the clearance of cancerous,
virus-infected, transplanted, antibody-opsonized, and stressed
cells, they discriminate between healthy-self, altered-self, and
non-self targets through the integration of balanced signals
delivered via multiple families of paired germline-encoded NK
cell receptors (NKR) (Raulet and Vance, 2006).
Several NKR families have been described, many of which are
grouped together in large genomic regions, such as the natural
killer gene complex (NKC). In rodents, most NKR are C-type
lectin-like proteins encoded within the NKC. These include the
Ly49 (Klra1) receptors, the CD94/NKG2 (Klrd1/Klrc1) receptors,
the NKG2D (Klrk1) receptor, and the NKR-P1 (Klrb1) receptors,
which interact with genetically-linked C-type lectin-related
(Clr/Clec2) proteins (Kirkham and Carlyle, 2014; Raulet and
Vance, 2006).
There exist at least five functional mouse NKR-P1 receptors,
three stimulatory isoforms (NKR-P1A,C,F), and two inhibitory iso-
forms (NKR-P1B,G) (Carlyle et al., 2008; Kirkham and Carlyle,
2014). Originally described almost 40 years ago (Glimcher et al.,
1977), the NKR-P1 proteins were the first receptors to be identi-
fied as selectively expressed by NK cells. Yet to date, NKR-
P1C, the prototypical NK1.1 antigen in B6 mice (Glimcher et al.,
1977; Koo and Peppard, 1984; Ryan et al., 1992), and NKR-P1A
remain orphan-activating receptors with unknown physiological
ligands. On the other hand, the paired NKR-P1F and NKR-P1G
receptors recognize overlapping ‘‘self’’ Clr (Clec2) ligands to bal-
ance signals during NK cell education and effector responses,
while the inhibitory NKR-P1B receptor recognizes the broadly ex-
pressed self Clr-b (Clec2d) ligand (Carlyle et al., 2004; Chen et al.,
2011; Iizuka et al., 2003; Kveberg et al., 2009). To date, Clr-b has

 been shown to be involved in ‘‘missing-self’’ recognition under
diverse pathological states (Kirkham and Carlyle, 2014), including
cancer (Carlyle et al., 2004), genotoxic and cellular stress (Fine
et al., 2010), hematopoietic transplantation (Chen et al., 2015), im-
mune escape of primary lymphoma cells (Rahim et al., 2015), and
cytomegalovirus and poxvirus infection (Aguilar et al., 2015; Voigt
et al., 2007; Williams et al., 2012), while the remainder of the self
Clr ligands remain less well characterized.
Among pathogens recognized by NK cells, cytomegaloviruses
(CMV) demonstrate co-evolution with their natural hosts, likely
due to cycles of natural selection for viral versus host fitness.
Since early responses to CMV infection are largely NK cell medi-
ated, these viruses have evolved a diverse array of immunoeva-
sins that antagonize NK cell function. For example, the MCMV
m157 decoy immunoevasin binds directly to inhibitory Ly49C/I
receptors from certain mouse strains, while the stimulatory
Ly49H receptor has been evolutionarily adapted to directly
recognize m157 as a foreign antigen, in turn dominantly estab-
lishing MCMV resistance in B6 mice (Arase et al., 2002).
Here, we identify the MCMV m02 family member, m12, as a
functional decoy ligand that directly engages the mouse NKR-
P1B inhibitory receptor and inhibits NK cell cytotoxicity. Impor-
tantly, we also demonstrate that m12 directly interacts with
two stimulatory orphan receptors, the prototypical NK1.1 anti-
gen, NKR-P1C, and NKR-P1A. These findings demonstrate an
important role for the NKR-P1 receptor family in NK cell-medi-
ated immunity to infection and identify m12 as the first physiolog-
ical NKR-P1CB6 ligand, almost four decades since its discovery
as the prototypical NK1.1 antigen (Glimcher et al., 1977).
RESULTS
MCMV Encodes an NKR-P1B Decoy Immunoevasin
The murine NKR-P1B ligand, Clr-b (Clec2d), is rapidly lost in
response to cellular infection by diverse viruses (Aguilar et al.,
2015; Voigtet al., 2007; Williams et al., 2012). However,MCMV-in-
fected fibroblasts also induce a Clr-b-independent NKR-P1B
ligand (Aguilar et al., 2015). To establish whether this was due to
a viral immunoevasin, we infected cells with different MCMV
strains and used them as stimulators for BWZ.CD3z/NKR-
P1B129 (BWZ.P1B129) reporter cell assays (Mesci and Carlyle,
2007). As shown in Figure 1, mock-treated NIH 3T3 cells or cells
exposed toUV-irradiated MCMV strongly stimulated BWZ.P1B129
reporter cells, a stimulus that was blocked using Clr-b mAb, while
weaker stimulation was observed upon live MCMVSmith infection,
which could not be blocked using Clr-b mAb (Figures 1A–1C).
Thus, live MCMV infection is required to both downregulate host
Clr-b and induce an alternative Clr-b-independent ligand.
To confirm that this signal was Clr-b independent, we gener-
ated Clr-b-deficient NIH 3T3 cells (NIH 3T3.DClrb) by CRISPR/
Cas9-mediated genome editing. Only MCMV-infected, but not
mock-treated, NIH 3T3.DClrb cells stimulated BWZ.P1B129 re-
porter cells (Figures 1D and 1E). Employing another approach,
we compared MCMV infection of primary adult ear fibroblasts
(AEF) from B6 WT and B6.Clr-b–/– mice (Chen et al., 2015);
here, BWZ.P1B129 reporter cells responded only to infected
B6.Clr-b–/– AEF, whereas WT AEF behaved similarly to NIH
3T3 cells (Figures S1A and S1B). Notably, similar results were
observed upon MCMV infection of primary Clrb–/–/b2m–/– AEF
cells (Figure S1C) and rat fibroblasts (data not shown). Thus, a
Clr-b/b2m-independent
NKR-P1B
ligand
is
induced
upon
MCMV infection of mouse and xenogeneic rat fibroblasts.
Since NKR-P1B is inhibitory, these results suggest that MCMV
may encode a decoy immunoevasin. To test this, we analyzed
distinct MCMV strains and large genomic deletion mutants to
determine whether any isolates lacked the NKR-P1B reporter
signal upon infection. The MCMVSmith and MCMVK181 strains
both generated strong BWZ.P1B129 reporter signals; however,
none of the mutants tested nor the parental BAC-generated
MCMVMW97 strain elicited significant BWZ.P1B129 reporter re-
sponses (Figures 1F and 1G). This suggested that MCMVMW97
might possess a polymorphism or loss-of-function mutation
that abrogated BWZ.P1B129 reporter cell recognition.
The MCMV-Encoded m12 Immunoevasin Targets
NKR-P1B-Mediated Inhibition
To take advantage of the discrepancy between the MCMV
strains, we conducted unbiased whole-transcriptome RNA-
sequencing (RNA-seq) using MCMV-infected NIH 3T3 cells to
identify differences between MCMVSmith and MCMVMW97. RNA-
seq reads were then mapped to the MCMV genome sequence
using TopHat analysis and visualized using the IGV browser.
Since numerous MCMV immunoevasin genes are located at the
left or right genomic termini, such as the m02 and m145 families,
we analyzed differences within these regions (Figures 1H and 1I).
Within the m145 family, few differences in transcript expression or
genetic polymorphisms were noted between the two MCMV
strains (Tables S1 and S2). In contrast, the m02 family displayed
significantly more differences in transcript profiles and single-
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP). To screen these alleles func-
tionally, we independently cloned all of the MCMVSmith m02 and
m145 family members and some other known immunoevasins
(in total, 32 gene products spanning �15% of the MCMV
genome) into a mammalian expression vector, and then we tested
them individually using human 293T transfectants as stimulators
for BWZ.P1BB6 reporter cells. While none of the m145 family
gene products yielded positive results, a single gene product in
the m02 family, m12, was capable of directly stimulating
BWZ.P1BB6, but not parental BWZ reporter cells (Figures 1J
and 1K). Thus, m12 is an NKR-P1B decoy ligand.

 m12 Is a Glycosylated Type I Transmembrane Protein
We next characterized the topology, localization, and functional
expression of m12. While a transmembrane (TM) domain was
identified near the C terminus of m12 (Figure S2A), SignalP did
not detect an N-terminal signal peptide. However, bioinformatic
analyses identified a second in-frame ATG codon that yielded a
canonical signal peptide (when analyzed by SignalP) and trans-
lational start site (according to the NetStart server). To validate
the second ATG translational initiation site, we generated several
m12 constructs, including native m12 (m12ATG1, m12ATG2) and
N-terminal FLAG-tagged m12 with either a native or preprotryp-
sin signal peptide (m12NSP-FLAG, m12PSP-FLAG). These constructs
were then analyzed using 293T transient transfectants, flow
cytometry, and BWZ.P1B129 reporter cell assays (Figures S2B
and S2C).
Notably, cell-surface m12FLAG was detected on transfectants
using ATG2 and both signal peptides (m12NSP-FLAG, m12PSP-FLAG),
confirming a type I TM topology (Figure S2B). In addition, all of the
m12 constructs stimulated BWZ.P1BB6 reporter cells, with
m12ATG1 yielding the weakest signal (Figure S2C). Collectively,
these results suggest that ATG2 is preferred, the native signal
peptide is cleaved, and m12 is expressed as a functional type I
TM cell-surface protein.

strains. Data are cumulative from four independent
experiments normalized to control values. Mean ±
SEM are shown, with significance determined by
two-way ANOVA relative to vector control.
To assess m12 biochemically, we con-
ducted immunoprecipitation and western
blot analysis of 293T transfectants. Under
non-reducing conditions, the m12 protein
exists both as a �35–40 kDa monomer
and a �60–75 kDa dimer (Figure S2D).
Under reducing conditions, only a single
band of �40 kDa was observed. Enzy-
matic digestion using endoglycosidase-H
(EndoH) revealed a �40 kDa EndoH-resis-
tant band and a �28 kDa EndoH-sensitive
band, while treatment with peptide-N-
glycosidase-F (PNGaseF) demonstrated
a single band at �28 kDa, in accordance
with a predicted size of 24.6 kDa. These
data suggest that m12 is a highly N-linked glycosylated type I
TM protein.
Recognition of m12 by the Prototypical NK1.1 Activating
Receptor, NKR-P1CB6
We next tested whether m12 was capable of interacting with pa-
ralogous host receptor isoforms and alleles. To this end, BWZ re-
porter cells bearing CD3z-fusion NKR-P1A/B/C/F/G receptors
were constructed from the FVB, B6, and 129/BALB-strain al-
leles. Notably, the NKR-P1BFVB and NKR-P1CB6 alleles react
with NK1.1 mAb, whereas the NKR-P1B129/BALB alleles do not
(Carlyle et al., 1999, 2006; Ryan et al., 1992), and NKR-P1A/
B/C forms a separate clade from NKR-P1F/G (Figure 2A).
When BWZ.NKR-P1 reporter cells were stimulated using 293T
transfectants of the m12Smith allele, the stimulatory NKR-P1A,
NKR-P1F, and inhibitory NKR-P1G receptors did not appre-
ciably recognize m12Smith (data not shown), while all inhibitory
NKR-P1B receptor alleles recognized m12Smith (Figures 2B,
2D, and 2F). Remarkably, the m12Smith immunoevasin also
significantly interacted with the stimulatory NKR-P1CB6 recep-
tor, demonstrating that m12Smith is a much-anticipated natural
ligand for the prototypical NK1.1 antigen (Glimcher et al., 1977;
Koo and Peppard, 1984; Ryan et al., 1992) (Figure 2C).

Cell 169, 58–71, March 23, 2017
 Interestingly, the NK1.1– NKR-P1CFVB allele also recognized
m12Smith, but the NK1.1– NKR-P1C129/BALB allele did not (Figures
2E and 2G), demonstrating that paralogous stimulatory recogni-
tion of m12Smith is not unique to B6 mice.
To confirm these results reciprocally, we also generated
BWZ.m12Smith reporter cells and used them to semiquantita-
tively assess interactions with all NKR-P1 alleles on 293T trans-
fectants (Figure 2H). Using this approach, BWZ.m12Smith re-
porters recognized NKR-P1BB6,129,FVB, NKR-P1AB6,129/FVB, and
NKR-P1CB6,FVB, but not NKR-P1C129; however, the stimulatory
NKR-P1A/C paralogs interacted with m12Smith more weakly
than the inhibitory NKR-P1B counterparts in this cellular context.
This was not due to splice variants nor inefficient surface expres-
sion of the stimulatory isoforms, as reciprocal domain swaps of
NKR-P1B and NKR-P1C stimulated m12Smith reporters similarly
to native isoforms (Figures S2E and S2F). Collectively, dual
recognition of m12 by paralogous NKR-P1 receptors with
opposing signals suggests that NKR-P1:m12 interactions are
evolving under selection pressures driven by host-pathogen
interactions.
Direct Interactions between the NKR-P1A/B/C and m12
Proteins
Next, we expressed soluble m12 and NKR-P1 receptor ectodo-
mains and assessed their interaction by surface plasmon reso-
nance (SPR). Here, m12Smith bound with similar affinity to the
inhibitory NKR-P1BB6 (Kd = 5.8 mM) and stimulatory NKR-
P1CB6 (Kd = 4.1 mM) receptors (Figure 3A). As observed using re-
porter cell assays, m12 recognition was found to be highly allele
sensitive, with m12Smith binding to NKR-P1B129 and NKR-
P1BFVB with affinities 8-fold (Kd = 0.7 mM) and 40-fold (Kd =
0.15 mM) higher than observed for NKR-P1BB6 (Figure 3A). As
controls, m12Smith did not bind to the structurally related
Ly49AB6 receptor and m04 did not bind appreciably to any
NKR-P1 alleles tested (Figure 3B). Notably, binding of m12Smith
to NKR-P1CB6, but not NKR-P1BB6, could be blocked using
NK1.1 mAb (Figure 3C), which only recognizes NKR-P1CB6
(and NKR-P1BFVB) but not NKR-P1BB6 (Figure 3D) (Carlyle
et al., 1999, 2006; Ryan et al., 1992).
We further generated m12Smith tetramers and used these to
stain transient 293T.NKR-P1 transfectants using an IRES-GFP
reporter vector. These m12 tetramers were found to bind directly
to cells expressing NKR-P1AB6,129,FVB, NKR-P1BB6,129,FVB, and
NKR-P1CB6,FVB, but not NKR-P1C129, NKR-P1F, or NKR-P1G
(Figure 3E). Notably, m12Smith tetramer staining of the activating
NKR-P1A/C receptors was significantly lower than for the inhib-
itory NKR-P1B receptors at similar IRES-GFP reporter levels,
indicating a weaker avidity of m12Smith for the cellular NKR-
P1A/C isoforms. In addition, the m12Smith tetramers bound to
fresh ex vivo B6-strain lymphocyte subsets, which mainly con-
sisted of the NKR-P1B+ subset of NK cells, with significantly
lower staining observed for the remaining NK cells, NKT cells,
and T cells, likely due to the weaker m12:NKR-P1A/C interac-
tions at the cell surface (Figure 3F). Interestingly, differential
results were observed for ex vivo lymphocytes from a number
of distinct mouse strains (B6.Clr-b–/–, 129, BALB/c, FVB; Fig-
ure S3A), suggesting that differential susceptibility to MCMV
m12 variants might be expected.
Reciprocally, we also generated NKR-P1B tetramers from the
B6, 129, and FVB strains and used these to stain m12-express-
ing cells. Here, NKR-P1BB6,129,FVB tetramers variably stained
transient
293T.m12
and
293T.Clr-b
transfectants,
stable
BWZ.m12 transductants, and NIH 3T3 cells infected with
MCMV variants, demonstrating their utility in the absence of
m12 mAb (Figures S3B–S3C and data not shown). Importantly,
differences in NKR-P1 tetramer staining levels were observed
using distinct NKR-P1 receptors across several m12 variants
from distinct MCMV strains; these differences likely reflect
their respective avidities for m12 variants at the cell surface (as
they follow a similar affinity hierarchy to SPR results, where
FVB > 129 > B6 for m12Smith; see also below). Collectively, the
above results demonstrate that there exists allelic and isoform
specificity among the direct m12:NKR-P1A/B/C protein-protein
interactions.
Structure of m12Smith Complexed to NKR-P1BB6
We next determined the structure of NKR-P1BB6 bound to
m12Smith (Figure 4; Figure S4; Table S3). NKR-P1B adopted a
classical C-type lectin-like domain (CTLD) fold and possessed
a compact b3-b4 loop rather than the extended conformation
observed in murine NKR-P1A (Kolenko et al., 2011) (Figure S4A).
Overall,
m12
adopts
an
eight-stranded
b-sandwich
fold
comprising one large (AIDEF) and one small (BGHC) b sheet,
similar to that described for the m04 immunoevasin (Figures
S4B–S4D) (Berry et al., 2014; Sgourakis et al., 2014). Like m04,
the m12 I strand possesses two cysteine residues (Cys168 and
Cys173) that form intra-molecular disulfide bonds with the CD
loop (Cys88) and A strand (Cys58), respectively. However, m12
also contains an additional disulfide bridge between Cys40-
Cys95 that serves to tether the relatively long N-terminal exten-
sion to the CD loop (Figure S4). Moreover, m12 possesses an
additional a helix between the B and C strands. Thus, m12 pos-
sesses unique structural features that are directly involved in
NKR-P1B receptor binding.
Topologically, m12 lies across the top of the NKR-P1B CTLD,
such that the m12 b sheets lie parallel to the interface (Figure 4A).
Here, m12 straddles NKR-P1B in a claw-like manner, whereby a
relatively flat ‘‘palm’’ engages the planar top surface of the NKR-
P1B CTLD, while several ‘‘fingers’’ grasp around the periphery
(Figures 4B–4C). This binding mode results in an extensive
interface that buries a total solvent-accessible surface area
of 2,180 A
˚ 2, which is considerably larger than the 1,680 A
˚ 2

 The interface is characterized by high shape complementarity
and is dominated by hydrophilic interactions, including 14
H bonds and 8 salt-bridges (Figure 4B and Table S4). The m12
palm encompasses residues from the A and B strands as well
as the interconnecting loop (Ser60-Leu66) that form an extended
surface that simultaneously engages the b2-b3 and b4-b5 loops
as well as the b4 strand of NKR-P1B. Here, the interaction is sta-
bilized by a number of H bonds that are primarily derived from
the m12 and NKR-P1B main chains (Figures 4C–4D). In contrast
to the flat, featureless palm, the m12 fingers are comprised of
multiple large, primarily polar residues that form highly specific
interactions around the edges of the docking site (Figures 4C

and 4E–4G). For example, the m12 N termi-
nus contains a highly charged 48ERR50 motif
that flanks the NKR-P1B CTLD (Figure 4E). In
addition, the loop region connecting the
NKR-P1B b1 sheet to the a1 helix is similarly
flanked by a triad of residues (Lys69, Asn73,
Val76) that emanate from the unique m12 a1
helix (Figure 4F). Further polar interactions
are centered on the base of the m12 I strand,
where Asp165 and Lys167 extend down-
ward in order to engage Glu200, Asn206,
Arg207, and Asn150 (Figure 4G). Overall,
the breadth and the polar claw style of the in-
teractions with NKR-P1B underlie the capac-
ity of m12 to target this receptor family.
A Single Allelic SNP between
m12Smith/MW97 Impacts NKR-P1B
Immunoevasin Function
Despite
differential
stimulation
of
BWZ.P1B129,B6 reporter cells by NIH 3T3
fibroblasts infected using MCMVSmith versus
MCMVMW97 (Figure 1G), quantitation of m12
transcripts by qRT-PCR revealed similar
mRNA levels between the two viruses (Fig-
ure 5A). However, a single G271A SNP
was observed in m12MW97 that resulted in
a non-conservative E91K charge substitu-
tion.
To
determine
whether
this
allelic
m12 SNP affected immunoevasin function,
we compared BWZ.P1BB6 reporter stimulation by m12MW97
versus m12Smith in 293T transfectants; indeed, m12MW97 was
recognized more weakly than m12Smith and host Clr-b (Fig-
ure 5B). This suggests that m12Smith is a superior NKR-P1B
immunoevasin versus m12MW97, at least in B6 mice. Importantly,
this finding was confirmed and extended using NKR-P1B
tetramers, whereby all three allelic NKR-P1BB6,129,FVB tetra-
mers stained transient 293T.m12Smith transfectants better than
293T.m12MW97 transfectants (Figure S3B).
We further validated these results using cytotoxicity assays.
Here, we generated stable retroviral transductant YAC-1 target
cells expressing native m12Smith, m12MW97, or host Clr-b

Cell 169, 58–71, March 23, 2017
 (indexed via IRES-GFP levels; Figure S5A). As observed using
293T transfectants, BWZ.NKR-P1 reporter analyses using
YAC-1 stimulators show that BWZ.P1BB6 cells recognize
m12Smith more strongly than m12MW97 (Figure 5C). In contrast,
BWZ.P1BFVB cells recognize m12Smith and m12MW97 similarly
(Figure S5B), suggesting that the energetic profile of the interac-
tion is allele specific. However, we could not detect significant
stimulation of BWZ.P1CB6 reporter cells using YAC-1.m12Smith
stimulators
(Figure
5D),
perhaps
due
to
the
lower
m12
expression levels on these sorted stable transductants; notably,
these data are consistent with reduced m12 tetramer staining of
NKR-P1A/C relative to NKR-P1B (Figure 3E).
Next, YAC-1 transductants were incubated as targets with
sorted NKp46+NKR-P1B+ or control NKp46+NKR-P1B– B6-strain
lymphokine-activated killer (NK-LAK) effectors in 51Cr-release
cytotoxicity assays. As shown in Figure 5, YAC-1.m12MW97 target
cells were killed equivalently to control YAC-1(–) targets, while
both YAC-1.m12Smith and YAC-1.Clr-b target cells significantly in-

Importantly,
inhibition
by
m12Smith and host Clr-b was mediated via
NKR-P1BB6, as it was not observed using
NKR-P1B– NK-LAK effectors (Figure 5F).
Notably, similar results were observed using
sorted FVB-strain NKR-P1B+ and NKR-
P1B– NK-LAK effectors, partitioned using
NK1.1 mAb (PK136), which recognizes
NKR-P1BFVB (but not NKR-P1CFVB) (Carlyle
et al., 1999) (Figures S5C and S5D). The
similar recognition of m12Smith and m12MW97 using BWZ.P1BFVB
reporters (Figure S5B) and NKR-P1BFVB tetramers (Figure S3B)
but strong inhibition of cytotoxicity only by m12Smith suggests
differential recognition of the m12 alleles by other stimulatory
receptors, such as the NKR-P1A/C paralogs (Figure 2H; see
also below).
The m12Smith:NKR-P1BB6 structure provided an opportunity to
understand the molecular basis underpinning the highly allele-
sensitive nature of this pivotal interaction. For example, NKR-
P1B129 differs from NKR-P1BB6 by 16 residues within the
CTLD, but only 4 contact m12Smith (S157R, Y158F, G201S, and
S204T). Of these, the S157R and G201S polymorphisms would
likely result in additional contacts with m12Smith and would
thereby account for the marked increase in affinity of NKR-
P1B129 compared to NKR-P1BB6 (Figure 5G). In addition, the
polymorphic m12 residue, E91, did not directly contact NKR-
P1BB6 but instead packed tightly against the m12 N terminus,
thereby facilitating the interaction of the m12 48ERR50 motif
Cell 169, 58–71, March 23, 2017
65
 with NKR-P1BB6 (Figure 5G). Here, the m12MW97 E91K polymor-
phism would likely disrupt this packing and would thus indirectly
abrogate the m12MW97:NKR-P1BB6 interaction.
Collectively, these data demonstrate that an allelic m12MW97
SNP results in less-efficient NKR-P1B immunoevasin function,
while the m12Smith immunoevasin is capable of effective inhibi-
tion of both B6 and FVB NK-LAK effectors using YAC-1 targets.
Moreover, the crystal structure provides a molecular basis for
understanding the impact of host and viral allelic variation across
the m12:NKR-P1B axis.
Wild MCMV Isolates Demonstrate Host-Driven Evolution
of the m12 Gene Product
The above findings support the existence of both host- and path-
ogen-driven evolutionary selection pressures, including the loss-
of-function m12MW97 SNP. Since NKR-P1B and NKR-P1C are
polymorphic between mouse strains, we investigated whether
additional
m12
polymorphisms
also
exist
in
wild-derived
MCMV isolates. Thus, we searched databases to compare
m12 sequences from additional MCMV strains, including the
Smith, K181, MW97.01, WP15B, C4A, C4B, C4C, C4D, G4,
AA18d, N1, and NO7 isolates (Smith et al., 2013); notably, with

To assess these functionally, we cloned
unique m12 gene products and then tested
their recognition using BWZ.NKR-P1 re-
porters and 293T.m12 transfectant stimu-
lators. We observed differences in recogni-
tion among all MCMV m12 alleles when
tested against the different NKR-P1B and
NKR-P1C alleles (Figures 6B–6G). The m12C4A variant has an
A34V substitution yet engaged all NKR-P1B alleles similarly to
m12Smith (Figures 6B, 6D, and 6F); this was also true using
NKR-P1B tetramers (Figure S3B). This result is not surprising,
since the most N-terminal m12 residue visible in the structure
(S39) is distal to the NKR-P1B binding site (Figure 5G). The
m12MW97 variant, as observed previously, has an E91K sub-
stitution and engaged NKR-P1BB6 much less efficiently than
m12Smith in both reporter assays and using NKR-P1B tetramers,
yet this difference was reduced using the NKR-P1B129 allele and
was absent using the NKR-P1BFVB allele (Figures 6B, 6D, and 6F;
Figure S3B). The highly diversified m12G4 variant was not recog-
nized by NKR-P1BB6, interacted with NKR-P1B129 similarly to
m12MW97, and interacted with NKR-P1BFVB less well than other
m12 variants (Figures 6B, 6D, and 6F; Figure S3B).
When tested against the NKR-P1C paralogs, all m12 variants
interacted with NKR-P1CB6 to some extent, although m12G4
recognition was very weak (Figure 6C). None of the m12 variants
were found to interact with NKR-P1C129 (Figure 6E), which may
not be functionally expressed, due to the absence of a key
cysteine residue (C122S) likely to be involved in intra-molecular
stabilization. In contrast, NKR-P1CFVB was stimulated strongly

 by m12Smith and m12C4A but very weakly by m12MW97 and m12G4
(Figure 6G), in turn suggesting that m12Smith immunoevasin func-
tion may be counterbalanced by host NKR-P1CFVB activation
relative to m12MW97 (see also below). Notably, NKR-P1BB6
and NKR-P1CFVB only differ in a single m12 contact residue
(S204T), thereby explaining their similar responses to the m12
variants (Figure 5G). Interestingly, Clr-b also weakly stimulated
NKR-P1CFVB reporters (Figures 6G and 6H), demonstrating
that host Clr-b represents a novel activating self NKR-P1C ligand
in the FVB strain. These data provide further evidence of the ex-
istence of host- and pathogen-driven evolution of the viral m12
decoy and reciprocal host adaptation of the NKR-P1B/C paral-
ogs. These findings also validate the hypothesis that the NKR-
P1B/C receptors have been co-evolving as a paired receptor
clade to recognize similar host and viral ligands.
MCMV Mutants Reveal NKR-P1B-Dependent Inhibition
In Vitro and Virulence In Vivo
To establish an immunoevasin role for m12, we generated m12-
modified variants of the parental MCMVMW97 strain, including
both m12-deficient (Dm12) and m12Smith-revertant (m12Smith)
mutants. In vitro characterization revealed that all three MCMV
variants similarly downregulated host Clr-b upon infection of
NIH 3T3 cells (Figure S7A).
Using infected NIH 3T3 cells directly, the m12Smith-revertant
virus stimulated BWZ.P1BB6 reporters similarly to the original
MCMVSmith virus, while the Dm12 mutant, parental MCMVMW97,
and mock-infected NIH 3T3 cells lacked significant stimulation
(notably, BWZ.P1BB6 reporters routinely fail to recognize endog-
enous host Clr-b levels on NIH 3T3 cells; Figure 7A). In contrast,
using BWZ.P1B129 reporters, strong stimulation was observed
with MCMVSmith virus, m12Smith-revertant virus, and mock-
infected NIH 3T3 cells, compared with weak stimulation using
parental MCMVMW97, and no stimulation using Dm12 mutant
MCMV (Figure 7B). Finally, using BWZ.P1BFVB reporter cells,
stimulation was observed using mock-infected cells, m12Smith-
revertant virus, MCMVSmith, and MCMVMW97, but not the Dm12
mutant virus (Figure 7C). The Clr-b-independent nature of these
responses was confirmed using blocking Clr-b mAb (data not
shown), as well as using mutant NIH 3T3.DClrb cells infected
with each of the MCMV strains (Figures S7B–S7D). Together,
these data demonstrate that m12 is a non-redundant NKR-
P1B decoy immunoevasin and that the m12 G271A SNP (E91K
polymorphism) identified between MCMVSmith and MCMVMW97
is responsible for the differential stimulation of BWZ.P1B re-
porter cells.
Next, we conducted 51Cr-release cytotoxicity assays using
sorted B6-strain NKR-P1B+ and NKR-P1B– NK-LAK effec-
tors and MCMV-infected NIH 3T3 targets. Notably, mock,
MCMVMW97, and Dm12-infected NIH 3T3 targets were efficiently
lysed, whereas m12Smith-infected targets displayed significantly
lower cytotoxicity in response to NKR-P1B+ effectors (Figure 7D).
Importantly, inhibition by m12Smith was NKR-P1B dependent, as
it was not observed using NKR-P1B– NK-LAK (Figure 7E). These
data reveal that m12Smith, but not m12MW97, is directly capable of
inhibiting B6-strain NK cytotoxicity in an NKR-P1B-dependent
manner upon live MCMV infection.
To evaluate m12 immunoevasin function in vivo, the three
variant MCMVMW97 strains were used to infect B6-strain WT,
Clr-b–/–, and Nkrp1b–/– mice, then MCMV virulence was evalu-
ated 3 days later using plaque assays and quantitative real-
time PCR (qPCR) for viral genomic copy numbers in infected
spleens. As expected, due to weak interaction between
m12MW97
and
NKR-P1BB6,
no
significant
difference
was
observed between the parental MCMVMW97 and Dm12 mutant
viruses in B6 WT mice in vivo (Figure 7F); remarkably, however,
the
m12Smith-revertant
virus
displayed
significantly
higher
splenic viral titers (PFU) and viral genomic copy numbers in B6
WT mice (Figures 7F–7G). Importantly, the enhanced virulence
of the m12Smith allele in vivo was NKR-P1B dependent and
Clr-b independent, as it was not observed using B6-strain
Nkrp1b–/– mice (Figures 7F–7G), yet Clr-b–/– mice displayed a
similar trend to WT B6 mice (data not shown). Notably, increased
virulence of MCMVSmith in vivo has been previously observed
using WT B6 mice relative to B6.Nkrp1b–/– mice (Rahim et al.,
2016). This finding is confirmed to be m12-dependent here
using
the
three
MCMVMW97-strain
variants,
where
the
m12Smith-revertant virus exhibits enhanced virulence versus
parental MCMVMW97 and Dm12 mutant MCMV, in WT B6, but
not B6.Nkrp1b–/–, mice. These findings confirm a non-redundant
NKR-P1B immunoevasin function for m12 in vivo.
To further elucidate the effects of the polymorphic host NKR-
P1A/B/C-clade isoforms and alleles, we next performed in vivo
experiments in the FVB, 129, and BALB inbred mouse strains us-
ing the three allelic MCMV variants. In the FVB strain, where
strong interactions are observed between m12Smith and both
the inhibitory NKR-P1BFVB and stimulatory NKR-P1CFVB recep-
tors (Figures 6F–6G), m12Smith function may be counterbalanced
by the paired receptors. However, the m12MW97 immunoevasin
function should be intact, since a moderate interaction is
observed for the inhibitory NKR-P1BFVB receptor yet a much
weaker interaction for the stimulatory NKR-P1CFVB receptor
(Figures 6F–6G). Interestingly, in FVB mice, no significant differ-
ence was observed between the m12Smith-revertant and Dm12
mutant viruses in vivo, while the parental MCMVMW97 virus main-
tained significantly elevated viral titers (Figure 7H). Thus, the
m12MW97 allele possesses superior immunoevasin function in
the FVB strain, where the m12Smith allele encounters opposing
function from the activating NKR-P1CFVB (and perhaps NKR-
P1AFVB) paralog.

one-way ANOVA (F–J) or unpaired student’s t-test (K).

Cell 169, 58–71, March 23, 2017
 On the other hand, in BALB/c and 129-strain mice, small but
significant differences were observed only between the parental
MCMVMW97 and Dm12 mutant viruses in vivo, with the m12Smith-
revertant virus showing an intermediate response (Figure 7I).
Interestingly, the published BALB/c and 129-strain NKR-P1A/
B/C alleles are identical. In keeping with this, we previously
observed moderate interactions between the inhibitory NKR-
P1BBALB/129 receptor and most m12 alleles (Figure 6D), no inter-
actions between the stimulatory NKR-P1CBALB/129 receptor and
any m12 alleles (Figure 6E), and a weak interaction for the stim-
ulatory NKR-P1ABALB/129 receptor and m12Smith (Figures 2H and
3E); thus, these in vivo results predict that the NKR-P1ABALB/129
receptor may have a higher affinity for m12MW97 versus m12Smith,
in turn resulting in lower viral titers. Notably, while NKR-
P1BBALB/129 appears to be functional upon overexpression,
m12Smith tetramers fail to stain ex vivo NK cells from the BALB/c
and 129 strains (Figure S3A), suggesting that both the NKR-
P1B/C129/BALB receptors may be non-functional in vivo, in turn
resulting in reliance on NKR-P1A129/BALB alone.
To further validate the NKR-P1B-decoy function of the m12
immunoevasin, we also performed in vivo infections using co-
horts of B6.Ly49H–/– mice, which lack the dominant Ly49HB6
activating receptor that recognizes m157, and BALB.B6Cmv1r
congenic mice, which are NK1.1+ and retain the B6-strain
Nkrp1 genes. Here, the dominant decoy function of the
m12Smith-revertant significantly augmented viral PFU titers in
both the B6.Ly49H–/– (Figure 7J) and BALB.B6Cmv1r (Figure 7K)
congenic host strains, relative to the Dm12 mutant and parental
m12MW97 viruses. These data confirm that the superior decoy
function of the m12Smith allele versus the m12MW97 allele is
enhanced in the absence of Ly49H, segregates with the B6-
strain NKR-P1 (Klrb1) region, and is unaffected by epistatic ef-
fects from the BALB genomic background.
Taken together, the above findings demonstrate that the im-
munoevasin function of m12 in vivo is both host and virus strain
dependent, and it can be functionally counterbalanced by both
inhibitory and stimulatory NKR-P1A/B/C-clade polymorphisms
and paralogs. These findings further confirm that complex inter-
actions between host NKR and MCMV immunoevasins ulti-
mately determine the outcome of host-pathogen interactions
in vivo.
DISCUSSION
The NK1.1 (NKR-P1; Klrb1) receptor family comprises both
activating and inhibitory members, with a bona fide ligand of
the activating NK1.1 antigen remaining unknown, despite being
described 40 years ago (Glimcher et al., 1977). We have identi-
fied m12 as a natural (viral) ligand for the prototypical NK1.1
antigen, the stimulatory NKR-P1CB6 orphan receptor (Glimcher
et al., 1977; Koo and Peppard, 1984; Ryan et al., 1992). In addi-
tion, host Clr-b represents a second (self) NKR-P1C ligand in the
FVB mouse strain. Moreover, we show that m12 functions as a
decoy immunoevasin to subvert NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity
by direct interaction with the inhibitory NKR-P1B receptor, which
normally surveys infected cells for Clr-b downregulation during
infection. The identification of the distantly Ig-related m02-family
member, m12, as an NKR-P1A/B/C-clade ligand demonstrates
sophisticated viral utilization of this protein fold to directly
engage an NKR. Structurally, m12 clamped around the NKR-
P1B receptor, in a polar claw mechanism, enveloping an exten-
sive area of NKR-P1B that simultaneously provided insight into
the specific targeting of the receptor by m12 and how allelic dif-
ferences in this axis impacted upon recognition. Here, a number
of the allelic polymorphisms in both the m12 immunoevasin and
NKR-P1 receptors either mapped to the binding site or were in
close proximity to it, thereby implying that both direct and indi-
rect effects can impact the m12-NKR-P1 recognition axis.
The m12 footprint overlapped extensively with that observed
for binding of the endogenous self ligand, KACL, to the closely
related human NKp65 receptor (Li et al., 2013). Indeed, the utili-
zation of existing binding sites on host receptors/ligands ap-
pears to be a common viral immune evasion strategy. Nonethe-
less, such structural mimicry does not necessarily underpin
immunoevasin strategies, as structurally diverse immunoeva-
sins, such as HCMV UL16 and MCMV m152, map to the same
sites on ligands for the human and mouse activating NKG2D re-
ceptors, respectively (Mu
¨ ller et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2012).
Further, some viral immunoevasins, including m157, can adopt
unusual and unanticipated binding modes (Berry et al., 2013).
Our work shows how the structurally divergent, viral Ig-like
m12 immunoevasin utilizes binding mode mimicry to engage
the inhibitory NKR-P1B receptor, which then underpins the abil-
ity of m12 to be reciprocally targeted by the structurally related
activating NKR-P1A/C family members, in turn countering the
m12 immunoregulatory properties.
The rodent Klrb1 genes display considerable polymorphism,
being subdivided into two antigenic and phylogenetic clusters
in mice and rats: the NKR-P1A/B/C and NKR-P1F/G clades (Car-
lyle et al., 2008; Kirkham and Carlyle, 2014; Kveberg et al., 2009).
Strikingly, the NKR-P1B and NKR-P1C receptors appear to have
undergone parallel divergence characteristic of paired recogni-
tion receptors, leading to the hypothesis that they are under
selective pressure, within the constraints imposed by both
endogenous self ligands and foreign viral ligands. Here, we pro-
vide compelling evidence of co-evolution at the host-pathogen
interface, with host adaptation of the NKR-P1A and NKR-P1C
(NK1.1) stimulatory receptor paralogs to directly recognize the
m12 decoy, as well as the existence of wild-derived viral m12 im-
munoevasin alleles, including loss-of-function alleles, which may
have evolved to avert direct NKR-P1A/C-mediated NK cell acti-
vation. We also provide strong evidence that m12 is a non-
redundant NKR-P1B-targeting immunoevasin in vivo. However,
the functional contribution of m12 to the outcome of host-path-
ogen interactions in vivo is ultimately determined by both the viral
m12 and host NKR-P1A/B/C-clade polymorphisms.
For example, each m12 allele may contribute differentially to
viral fitness in distinct mouse strains, and what may appear to
be a superior immunoevasin in one mouse strain may be coun-
terbalanced by opposing signals from both inhibitory NKR-P1B
and activating NKR-P1A/C paralogs in another mouse strain.
Our in-depth analyses employing eight inbred, mutant, or
congenic mouse strains and three MCMV variants underscore
how viral versus host fitness can be significantly impacted by
polymorphisms in both the paired host receptors and viral
immunoevasin.

 The conserved use of decoy immunoevasins by MCMV (m12)
and RCMV (RCTL) to subvert NKR-P1B-mediated NK cell im-
munosurveillance of pathological target cells highlights the
role of the NKR-P1:Clr recognition axis in immunity to infectious
disease and suggests that similar mechanisms may operate
during HCMV infection of human cells (Aguilar et al., 2015;
Voigt et al., 2007). Notably, the human NKR-P1A:LLT1 recep-
tor-ligand pair are likely orthologous to some rodent NKR-
P1:Clr interactions. NKR-P1A (CD161) is inhibitory and is ex-
pressed on �60% of human NK cells (Lanier et al., 1994),
resembling NKR-P1B in function and expression. LLT1 has
more restricted expression than Clr-b and is induced in
response to PRR agonists and infection (Aguilar et al., 2015;
Germain et al., 2011; Rosen et al., 2008). It remains to be deter-
mined whether HCMV may similarly target the human NKR-P1A
receptor.
The NK1.1 antigen was the prototypical receptor identified
to be selectively expressed by NK cells. Thus, while being
used as a tool to study and purify NK cells for almost four de-
cades, the physiological ligand for the activating NK1.1 antigen
has remained a mystery. Here, we showcase m12 as a natural
virally encoded ligand for this important NKR family. More-
over, NK1.1 is also found on some ILC and various T cell sub-
sets, including invariant NKT cells, the ubiquitous mucosal-
associated invariant T (MAIT) cells, CD4+ T helper cells, and
activated CD8+ T cells. Thus, targeting of the NK1.1 antigen by
a virally encoded ligand has important implications for both
innate and adaptive immunity, virus-host co-evolution, and
immunotherapy.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Animals
C57BL/6 (B6) micewere purchase from the Jackson Laboratory, FVB/N (FVB) and 129S6 (129) mice were purchased from Charles River.
We have previously described the B6.Nkrp1b–/– and B6.Clrb–/– mice (Chen et al., 2015; Rahim et al., 2015). B6.Ly49h–/– and Balb.B6-
Cmv1r mice have previously been described (Fodil-Cornu et al., 2008; Scalzo et al., 1995). All animals were maintained according to
approved protocols at the respective institutes: Sunnybrook Research Institute, University of Ottawa, and the University of Rijeka.
Viruses
MCMV (Smith strain), MCMV-GFP, and MW97.01 (BAC-generated strain) have all been previously described (Aguilar et al., 2015).
MCMVSmith and MCMV-GFP were provided by Dr. Silvia Vidal (McGill University). The MCMVK181 strain was provided by Dr. Michael
G. Brown (University of Virginia). The Dm12 mutant virus and m12Smith-revertant viruses were constructed using BAC technology that
has previously been described (Wagner and Koszinowski, 2004).
Cells
NIH 3T3, YAC-1, and HEK293T cells were purchased from the American Type and Culture Collection (ATCC). BWZ.36 cells were
obtained from N. Shastri (UC Berkeley, CA, USA). B6 mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) were obtained from T.W. Mak (University
of Toronto, Canada). Cells were cultured in complete DMEM-HG, supplemented with 2 mM glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 mg/ml
streptomycin, 50 mg/mL gentamicin, 110 mg/mL sodium pyruvate, 50 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 10 mM HEPES, and 10% FCS. Cells
were maintained in incubator at 37�C, 5% CO2.
Sf9 and Hi5 cells were cultured in Insect-XPRESS medium (Lonza) at 27�C and maintained with shaking at 120 rpm. HEK293S
GnTi- adherent cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% Pen/Strep/Glutamine (GIBCO) at 37�C in the pres-
ence of 5% CO2. For protein expression, FBS was reduced to 2%.
METHOD DETAILS
Virus infections
All viruses were passaged using MEF cells, and purified according to described protocols (Aguilar et al., 2015). For in vitro infections,
mouse fibroblasts were infected with MCMV at an MOI of 0.5 PFU/cell, centrifuged at 800xg for 30 min, and incubated at 37�C. For
in vivo infections, mice were infected intraperitoneally with 0.2-1x106 PFU and sacrificed on day 3, tissues harvested, and the viral
titers were assessed using plaque-forming assays (Aguilar et al., 2015).
Flow cytometry and antibodies
Flow cytometry was performed as previously described (Chen et al., 2015). Clr-b mAb (4A6) has previously been described (Carlyle
et al., 2004). The NKR-P1BB6 mAb and hybridoma (2D12) were a kind gift from Drs. Koho Izuka and Wayne Yokoyama (Iizuka et al.,
2003). All other mAb clones were purchased from eBioscience or Sigma-Aldrich and are has follows: NK1.1 (PK136); NKp46 (29A1.4);
CD3ε (145-C11); FcgRII/III (2.4G2); CD49b/DX5 (clone DX5); gdTCR (clone GL3); FLAG (M2); streptavidin, SA-PE/APC (Thermo Fisher
Scientific). The CD1d-tetramer loaded with PBS-57 (aGalCer analog) was a kind gift from Dr. Thierry Mallevaey. For tetramerization,
purified biotinylated monomers (m12Smith, NKR-P1BB6,129,FVB) were incubated with SA-PE in a 4:1 molar ratio, aliquoted in 1/10th
volumes over a 3 hr period at 4�C.
Cells were stained in flow buffer (HBSS, 0.5% BSA and 0.03% NaN3) on ice with primary monoclonal antibodies for 25-30 min,
or secondary streptavidin conjugates for 15-20 min, washed between incubations and then analyzed using a FACSCalibur or
FACSCanto II flow cytometer, or FACS sorted using a FACSAria (BD Biosciences). For staining of ex vivo splenocytes or
NKp46+CD3– lymphokine-activated killer (NK-LAK) effectors, cells were pre-incubated with 2.4G2 mAb for 10 min on ice prior to
staining with antibodies. Cells were stained with tetramers by incubating on ice for 1 hr. Cells were analyzed by live gating for
FSC/SSC, doublet excluded, exclusion of propidium iodide or DAPI for viability, and then according to cell surface markers. Flow
cytometry files were analyzed using FlowJo software.
BWZ Reporter Cell Assays
The ectodomains of the mouse NKR-P1 genes were PCR amplified from day 6 LAK cDNA (see Table S5 for primers) and cloned into a
type-II MSCV vector to make chimeric receptors with intracellular CD3z domains. MCMV m12/CD3z chimeric reporters were con-
structed by cloning the ectodomain of m12 into a type-I MSCV vector (Mesci and Carlyle, 2007). Retroviruses produced with these
constructs were used to transduce BWZ.36 cells, and then sorted for IRES-GFP+ expression. All reporters were sorted to have
Cell 169, 58–71.e1–e6, March 23, 2017
e4
 matched GFP expression. Reporter assays were done by co-culturing reporter cells (5x104) with serially diluted amounts of
stimulators in 96-well plates. Stimulators used were either MCMV-infected, mock-infected, or cells transfected with plasmids using
Lipofectamine2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Positive control cells were stimulated with 10 ng/mL PMA plus 0.5 mM ionomycin. These
cells were incubated overnight, washed with PBS, then resuspended in 150 mL of 1X CPRG buffer (90 mg/L chlorophenol-red-b-D-
galactopyranoside (Roche), 9 mM MgCl2, 0.1% NP-40, in PBS), incubated at room temperature, then analyzed using a Varioskan
microplate reader (Thermo Fisher Scientific), using OD 595-655.
51Chromium release cytotoxicity assays
Splenic lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) effector cells were generated by harvesting spleens from mice, processing into single cell
suspensions, ACK lysed (Thermo Fisher Scientific), then grown in 10% complete RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 2500 U/mL
human rIL-2 (Proleukin; Novartis). On day 4, these cells were FACS sorted for NKp46+CD3– NK cells subsetted based upon NKR-
P1BB6/FVB (2D12 or NK1.1 mAb) expression, and used as effectors in 51Cr-release assays on day 6 or 7. Target cells were labeled
with 50 mCi Na2
51CrO4 (Perkin Elmer) in FCS for 1 hr at 37�C, washed, plated in 96-well V-bottom plates in serial dilutions with effector
cells at corresponding ratios, and incubated at 37�C for 4 hr. Supernatants (100 ml) were then transferred to scintillation plates
(LumaPlate-96; Perkin Elmer), dried overnight, and counted using a Top Count NXT microplate Scintillation Counter (Packard
Instrument Company). Percent specific lysis values were calculated relative to standard maximum release (2% Triton X-100) and
spontaneous release (media) values.
Generation of NIH 3T3.DClr-b cells using CRISPR-Cas9 technology
The pX458 vector was utilized in accordance with Dr. Zhang’s protocol for generating targeting vectors (www.genome-engineering.
org/crispr/). The sequence of oligos used for constructing Clec2d targeting vector were: sense: 50-cac cgC TAC CTA TGC TTA GTC
CCA C-30; anti-sense: 50-aaa cGT GGG ACT AAG CAT AGG TAG c-30. This vector was transfected into NIH 3T3 cells that were then
sorted for GFP+Clr-b– expression. These cells were then subcloned using limiting dilution. Appropriate clones were selected lacking
Clr-b cell surface staining and BWZ.NKR-P1B reporter stimulation.
Protein expression and purification
Codon optimized genes encoding NKR-P1 receptors and m12 were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies. For NKR-P1BB6,
the unpaired cysteine residue at position 118 was replaced with a glycine. The ectodomains (residues 89-215) of NKR-P1BB6,129,FVB
and NKR-P1CB6 were cloned into a modified pHLSec vector upstream of a biotinylation site and a His tag (for SPR) or a His tag (for
crystallization), and expressed via transient transfection in HEK293S cells as described previously (Berry et al., 2013; Berry et al.,
2014). For a single 6000 cm3 roller bottle, 600 mg plasmid DNA was mixed with 900 mL PEI (1 mg/ml) and 50 mL serum-free DMEM
media. This mixture was added to HEK293S GnTi- cells after a 10 min incubation, followed by the subsequent addition of a further
200 mL DMEM and FCS to give a final concentration of 2%. Media was harvested after 3 and 6 days. DNA encoding m12Smith (res-
idues 29-208) was ligated into the pFastbac vector (ThermoFisher Scientific) upstream of a 6x Histidine tag and used to generate
recombinant baculovirus according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Specifically, the plasmid was transformed into DH10Bac
E.coli cells in order to produce bacmid DNA. Recombinant baculoviruses were generated by transfection of Sf9 cells using Cell-
fectin 2. Protein was expressed in Hi5 insect cells by the addition of 2% P3 virus, and harvested after 48-72h. Cell culture media
containing secreted m12 or NKR-P1 receptors was concentrated by tangential flow filtration and purified using nickel affinity and
size exclusion chromatography using HisTrap and Superdex 200 columns 16/60 (GE Healthcare) respectively. For biotinylation,
purified NKR-P1 receptors were buffer exchanged into 10 mM Tris and biotinylated overnight at 20�C prior to removal of free biotin
via size exclusion chromatography. For SPR experiments, m12 protein was used immediately following purification. However,
samples stored at 4�C at high concentration were prone to proteolytic degradation, resulting in a loss of �4 kDa of mass from
the carboxy-terminus, as judged by SDS-PAGE analysis. This truncated form of m12 could be selectively purified from the intact
molecule by nickel affinity chromatography and bound to NKR-P1 receptors with the same affinity as the entire m12 ectodomain
(data not shown). Accordingly, this truncated form of m12 was used for crystallization experiments. The ectodomains of Ly49AB6
and m04Smith were produced in HEK293SGnTi- cells as described for NKR-P1 above and previously (Berry et al., 2013; Berry
et al., 2014).
Surface plasmon resonance (SPR)
SPR experiments were performed at 25�C on a Biacore 3000 using a running buffer consisting of 10 mM Tris pH8 containing
150 mM NaCl and 0.005% P20. Approximately 800 response units of biotinylated NKR-P1/Ly49 receptors were coupled on to
streptavidin-coated chips according to the manufacturer’s instructions (GE Healthcare). Remaining free streptavidin sites were
blocked with D-biotin. m12 (0.025-50 mM) or m04 (100 mM) was injected over the immobilized receptors at a flow rate of 20 ml/min
and the final response was calculated by subtraction of the response of an ‘empty’ flow cell (containing biotin blocked strepta-
vidin). For blocking experiments, 50 mM m12Smith was passed over immobilized NKR-P1BB6 and NKR-P1CB6 both before and after
injection of 30 mL of 10 mg/ml NK1.1 (clone PK136-StemCell Technologies, Inc.). Equilibrium data were analyzed in
GraphPad Prism.

 Crystallization and data collection
For crystallization, the m12Smith and NKR-P1BB6 ectodomains were mixed in a 1:1 molar ratio at a final protein concentration of
6.5 mg/ml. Crystals were obtained by the hanging drop vapor-diffusion method from a solution containing 41% PEG 400, 0.1 M
Bis/Tris pH 6.3 and 0.4 M sodium iodide at 20�C. Crystals were flash cooled using liquid nitrogen and X-ray diffraction data were
recorded on a Quantum-315 CCD detector at the MX2 beamline of the Australian Synchrotron. Data were integrated using iMOSFLM
and scaled using SCALA from the CCP4 program suite. Details of the data processing statistics are given in Table S3.
Structure determination and refinement
The structure was solved by molecular replacement using the Phaser program. The initial search model comprised a truncated form of
the NKR-P1A CTLD (PDB ID: 3M9Z) that lacked the extended loop located between the b3 and b4 strands. The resulting unbiased elec-
tron density was not sufficient to build m12 de novo. However, molecular replacement using an extensively truncated fragment of m04
(PDB ID: 4PN6) comprising only the I, D, E’ and F strands improved the quality of the electron density map to an extent that allowed the
remainder of the m12 molecule to be built. The structure was refined using Buster. Model building was performed in Coot, and figures
were prepared with Pymol (http://www.pymol.org) and APBS. Details of the refinement statistics are provided in Table S4.
DNA/RNA Isolation, cDNA synthesis and PCR cloning
Genomic DNA was isolated using Easy-DNA kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). RNA was isolated using Total RNA isolation kit with gDNA
removal (Norgen Biotek) and reverse transcription reactions were done using Superscript III cDNA synthesis kit (Thermo Fisher Sci-
entific). Quantitative RT-PCR was performed on a CFX-96 PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad) using 20-50 ng of cDNA, and PerfeCTa
qPCR mix (Quanta Biosciences). The primers used can be found in Table S5.
PCR cloning of m02 and m145 family members was done using gene-specific primers with appropriate restriction enzyme sites,
cDNA from MCMV-GFP infected NIH 3T3, amplified with Q5 high-fidelity PCR system (New England Biolabs), and cloned into the
pIRES2-EGFP vector (Clontech). The summary of primers can be found in Table S5. The m12C4A gene was synthesized by con-
ducting in situ mutagenesis using primers found in Table S5. The m12G4 gene was synthesized using GeneArt services from Thermo
Fisher Scientific (Burlington, ON). Cloning of the Nkrp1 genes was mediated by PCR using gene specific primers (Table S5).
Immunoprecipitations and Western Blotting
N-terminally FLAG-tagged constructs of m12 were generated using primers in (Table S5) and cloned into pIRES2-EGFP vector.
These constructs were transfected into either HEK293T or NIH 3T3 cells and immunoprecipitations were done using anti-FLAG
mAb bound to Protein A/G agarose beads in 1% NP-40 buffer. The isolates were run on SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon
PVDF membrane (EMD Millipore) and blotted for anti-FLAG-HRP conjugated antibody (Cell Signal Technologies) and developed
with Immobilon ECL reagent. Blots were imaged using a MicroChemi 4.2.
RNA-Sequencing and Analysis
Total RNA from either mock-infected, MCMV-GFP, or MW97.01-infected NIH 3T3 cells using mirVana kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
These samples were quality checked using an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 and confirmed to have RNA integrity values of > 9, then
used to create a cDNA library for SOLiD RNA-Sequencing. For analysis of viral transcripts, raw data was mapped onto the MCMVSmith
reference genome (accession number GU305914) using TopHat algorithm and Cufflinks was applied to report RPKM values. Mapped
reads were visualized using the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV version 2.3.34, Broad Institute, https://www.broadinstitute.org/igv/).
Bioinformatic analysis
Mapped RNA-Seq reads were loaded visualized on the IGV Genome Browser using the MCMVSmith reference genome (accession
number GU305914). Membrane topology was determined using the TMpred server (http://www.ch.embnet.org/software/
TMPRED_form.html). The SignalP 4.1 Server (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/) was used for identification of predicted
signal peptides. Detection of ORF start site was achieved using the NetStart 1.0 Prediction Server website (http://www.cbs.dtu.
dk/services/NetStart/).
QUANTITATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 7, using either a paired Student’s two-tailed t test, or one-way/two-way ANOVA, where
applicable. See figure legends for details. Statistical significance is defined as: * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001.
