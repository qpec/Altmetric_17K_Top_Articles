BACKGROUND
The long-term effects on neurodevelopment of the use of inhaled glucocorticoids 
in extremely preterm infants for the prevention or treatment of bronchopulmo-
nary dysplasia are uncertain.
METHODS
We randomly assigned 863 infants (gestational age, 23 weeks 0 days to 27 weeks 
6 days) to receive early (within 24 hours after birth) inhaled budesonide or placebo. 
The prespecified secondary long-term outcome was neurodevelopmental disability 
among survivors, defined as a composite of cerebral palsy, cognitive delay (a Men-
tal Development Index score of <85 [1 SD below the mean of 100] on the Bayley 
Scales of Infant Development, Second Edition, with higher scores on the scale 
indicating better performance), deafness, or blindness at a corrected age of 18 to 
22 months.
RESULTS
Adequate data on the prespecified composite long-term outcome were available for 
629 infants. Of these infants, 148 (48.1%) of 308 infants assigned to budesonide 
had neurodevelopmental disability, as compared with 165 (51.4%) of 321 infants 
assigned to placebo (relative risk, adjusted for gestational age, 0.93; 95% confi-
dence interval [CI], 0.80 to 1.09; P 
= 
0.40). There was no significant difference in 
any of the individual components of the prespecified outcome. There were more 
deaths in the budesonide group than in the placebo group (82 [19.9%] of 413 in-
fants vs. 58 [14.5%] of 400 infants for whom vital status was available; relative 
risk, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.86; P 
= 
0.04).
CONCLUSIONS
Among surviving extremely preterm infants, the rate of neurodevelopmental dis-
ability at 2 years did not differ significantly between infants who received early 
inhaled budesonide for the prevention of bronchopulmonary dysplasia and those 
who received placebo, but the mortality rate was higher among those who re-
ceived budesonide. (Funded by the European Union and Chiesi Farmaceutici;

Long-Term Effects of Inhaled Budesonide
B
ronchopulmonary dysplasia is the 
most common chronic complication of 
extremely preterm birth, and rates of this 
complication have remained stable or increased 
among extremely preterm infants in the past two 
decades.1 Bronchopulmonary dysplasia is associ-
ated with higher mortality rates, and among sur-
vivors it confers a predisposition to chronic respi-
ratory and cardiovascular impairment, growth 
failure, and neurodevelopmental delay.2-5 Neona-
tal pharmacologic therapies are an important tool 
for reducing the burden of bronchopulmonary 
dysplasia. Systemic glucocorticoids are effective 
for the prevention of bronchopulmonary dyspla-
sia but can increase the risk of neurodevelop-
mental impairment.6,7 Administration of inhaled 
glucocorticoids may have beneficial effects on the 
pulmonary system, with a lower risk of adverse 
effects. Many preterm infants receive inhaled 
glucocorticoids for the prevention or treatment 
of bronchopulmonary dysplasia during routine 
clinical care.8-12 Despite their widespread use, in-
haled glucocorticoids have been evaluated in only 
a few small, short-term studies.8 We conducted 
this large, international, randomized, placebo-
controlled trial to study the short-term and long-
term efficacy and safety of inhaled budesonide 
for the prevention of bronchopulmonary dyspla-
sia in extremely preterm infants. With respect to 
the primary composite outcome — bronchopul-
monary dysplasia or death at 36 weeks of post-
menstrual age — we found a nonsignificant 
difference (P 
= 
0.05) between infants randomly as-
signed to inhaled budesonide and those assigned 
to placebo. Budesonide treatment resulted in a 
significantly lower risk of bronchopulmonary 
dysplasia than placebo; however, mortality was 
higher in the budesonide group, although the 
between-group difference was not significant.13 
We further aimed to determine whether inhaled 
budesonide for the prevention of bronchopulmo-
nary dysplasia alters the rate of neurodevelop-
mental disability at a corrected age of 18 to 22 
months.
Methods
Initial Trial Period
Infants with a gestational age of 23 weeks 0 days 
to 27 weeks 6 days and a chronologic age of 12 
hours or less who required any form of positive-
pressure respiratory support were eligible for this 
trial. The exclusion criteria and the randomiza-
tion procedure are described in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix, available with the full text of this 
article at NEJM.org. The primary outcome — 
bronchopulmonary dysplasia or death at a post-
menstrual age of 36 weeks — and other short-
term outcomes have been reported previously.13,14 
In summary, 863 infants were enrolled during 
the period from April 2010 through August 2013 
at 40 trial centers in nine countries and were 
randomly assigned to receive early (within 24 
hours after birth) inhaled budesonide or placebo. 
Randomization was stratified according to gesta-
tional age (23 weeks 0 days to 25 weeks 6 days 
vs. 26 weeks 0 days to 27 weeks 6 days). Metered-
dose inhalers containing budesonide or placebo 
were supplied free of charge by Chiesi Farmaceu-
tici, and Trudell Medical International supplied 
the spacers (AeroChamber mini) free of charge. 
Neither company had any role in the design or 
conduct of the trial, the analysis of the data, the 
reporting and interpretation of the results, or the 
writing of the manuscript. The research ethics 
board at each of the clinical centers approved 
the protocol. Written informed consent was ob-
tained from a parent or guardian of each infant, 
and appropriate regulatory approvals were ob-
tained in participating countries. Six of the au-
thors vouch for the accuracy and completeness 
of the data and analyses, and all the authors 
vouch for the fidelity of the trial to the protocol. 
The trial protocol and statistical analysis plan 
are available at NEJM.org.
The dose of budesonide was two puffs (200 μg 
per puff) administered every 12 hours in the first 
14 days of life and one puff administered every 
12 hours from day 15 until the infants no longer 
required supplemental oxygen and positive-pres-
sure support or until they reached a postmen-
strual age of 32 weeks, regardless of ventilatory 
status. The mean total duration of budesonide 
use was 33.9 days.13 Infants received the first 
dose of the trial drug within 12 hours after ran-
dom assignment, which occurred at a median of 
6.7 hours after birth in the budesonide group 
and 6.6 hours after birth in the placebo group.
All adverse events in the trial were related to 
the initial hospital stay of the participants and 
have been reported previously.13 An external data 
and safety monitoring committee reviewed the

trial safety data four times and the results of the 
interim analysis for efficacy after 50% of infants 
had been enrolled. After the last safety review, 
when patient enrollment had already been com-
pleted, the committee recommended that the trial 
drugs be withheld because of a rate of death that 
was higher, although nonsignificantly higher, in 
the budesonide group than in the placebo group, 
according to the data available for review at that 
time. However, at the time of this recommenda-
tion, trial drugs had already been discontinued in 
all the patients in accordance with the protocol.
Prespecified Long-Term Outcome
Overall, our trial protocol lists 13 prespecified 
secondary outcomes. The only prespecified sec-
ondary long-term outcome was neurodevelop-
mental disability among survivors, defined as a 
composite of cerebral palsy, cognitive delay, deaf-
ness, or blindness at a corrected age of 18 to 22 
months. Neurodevelopmental assessment was 
performed by trained and experienced examin-
ers who were unaware of the treatment assign-
ments. Documentation of the presence of the 
prespecified composite long-term outcome re-
quired confirmation that the infant had survived 
with one or more of the four types of disability. 
Documentation of the absence of the prespeci-
fied composite outcome required confirmation 
that the infant had survived without any disabil-
ity. The composite long-term outcome was des-
ignated as “missing” if one or more of its four 
components were not successfully tested and the 
successfully tested component or components 
did not reveal any impairment. Follow-up was 
targeted for a corrected age of 18 to 22 months, 
but efforts to conduct assessments continued be-
yond a corrected age of 22 months when neces-
sary. Cerebral palsy was diagnosed if the patient 
had nonprogressive motor impairment charac-
terized by abnormal muscle tone and decreased 
range or control of movements. The level of gross 
motor function was determined with the use of 
the Gross Motor Function Classification System.15 
Cognitive delay was defined as a Mental Devel-
opment Index score of less than 85 (1 SD below 
the mean of 100) on the Bayley Scales of Infant 
Development, Second Edition, on which the 
minimum score is 50 and the maximum score is 
150 and higher scores indicate better perfor-
mance.16 The score was assumed to be less than 
85 if the child could not be tested because of 
severe developmental delay. Audiometry was per-
formed to determine the presence or absence of 
sensorineural hearing loss. Blindness was defined 
as a corrected visual acuity of less than 20/200.
Exploratory Outcomes
Data for the following exploratory outcomes were 
collected prospectively in case-report forms that 
were designed at the onset of the trial: height 
percentile; weight percentile; head circumference 
percentile; mean Psychomotor Development Index 
scores on the Bayley scales; mean Mental Devel-
opment Index scores; Mental Development Index 
score of less than 70; cerebral palsy with a gross 
motor function level of 3 to 5 (on a scale of 1 
[mild impairment] to 5 [most severe impair-
ment]); hospital admission after initial discharge 
for any medical reason or any surgical procedure; 
use of inhaled glucocorticoids, systemic glucocor-
ticoids, leukotriene antagonists, or bronchodila-
tors for at least 2 months after initial discharge; 
use of supplemental oxygen or positive-pressure 
ventilation for more than 1 week after initial 
discharge; and diagnosis of hypertrophic ob-
structive cardiomyopathy at any time after birth. 
We also analyzed mortality and a composite out-
come of death or neurodevelopmental disability 
at the time of the follow-up assessment. Docu-
mentation of the presence of the composite 
long-term outcome required confirmation that 
the infant had died or had survived with one or 
more of the four types of disability included in 
the prespecified secondary composite long-term 
outcome. Documentation of the absence of this 
composite exploratory long-term outcome re-
quired confirmation that the infant had survived 
without any disability. The criteria to constitute 
adequate evidence for this assessment were the 
same as for the prespecified composite long-
term outcome.
Statistical Analysis
Comparisons of secondary outcomes were per-
formed with the use of stratified and nonstrat-
ified Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel tests for di-
chotomous outcomes and the Wilcoxon test for 
continuous outcomes. We did not adjust for 
multiple comparisons. Two-sided P values of less 
than 0.05 were considered to indicate statistical 
significance. SAS software, version 9.2 (SAS Insti-
tute), was used for analyses. We performed the 
analysis on the basis of the intention-to-treat

principle, and we included infants who were 
tested later than a corrected age of 22 months. 
We conducted post hoc sensitivity analyses with 
imputation of missing data (see the Supplemen-
tary Appendix).
Results
Trial Participants
Figure 1 shows the number of infants who were 
screened for the trial, who were randomly as-
signed to receive inhaled budesonide or placebo, 
and who were assessed for follow-up. Follow-up 
assessment began on February 23, 2012, and 
ended on March 10, 2016. The primary outcome 
was analyzed in an intention-to-treat population 
of 856 infants (437 in the budesonide group and 
419 in the placebo group); 43 infants (5%) were 
lost to follow-up, and 140 infants died before the 
follow-up assessment. Of these 140 infants, 131 
died before 36 weeks of postmenstrual age and 
were included in our previous analysis of short-
term trial outcomes.13 The baseline characteris-
tics and the short-term outcomes of the 43 infants 
who were lost to follow-up are shown in Table S2 
in the Supplementary Appendix. A follow-up as-
sessment was performed in 673 infants, but in 
the case of 44 infants, this assessment was in-
complete and neurodevelopmental disability could 
not be evaluated. (The individual test results of 
these 44 infants are provided in Table S3 in the 
Supplementary Appendix.) Therefore, adequate 
data were available for 629 infants for the analy-
sis of neurodevelopmental disability among sur-
vivors, for 769 infants for the composite of death 
or neurodevelopmental disability, and for 813 
infants for mortality up to the completion of 
follow-up.
Among infants with adequate data for the as-
sessment of the prespecified composite out-
come, characteristics were similar between the 
two groups at birth and at the time of random-
ization. The rate of bronchopulmonary dysplasia 
at 36 weeks of postmenstrual age was lower in 
the budesonide group than in the placebo group. 
The ages of the patients at follow-up and the 
characteristics of their caregivers were similar in 
the two groups (Table 1).
Prespecified Secondary Long-Term Outcome
Results regarding the prespecified secondary long-
term outcome and its components are shown in 
Table 2. The rate of neurodevelopmental dis-
ability did not differ significantly between the 
budeso 
nide group and the placebo group. 
Among infants for whom adequate data on the 
prespecified secondary outcome were available, 
148 (48.1%) of 308 infants assigned to budesonide 
had neurodevelopmental disability, as compared 
with 165 (51.4%) of 321 infants assigned to pla-
cebo (relative risk, adjusted for gestational age, 
0.93; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.80 to 1.09; 
P 
= 
0.40). There were no significant differences 
between the two groups in the rates of the four 
components of the composite outcome — cere-
bral palsy, blindness, hearing loss, and cognitive 
delay (Mental Development Index score <85) 
(Table 2).
Exploratory Outcomes
Death or neurodevelopmental disability occurred 
in 59.0% of the infants in the budesonide group 
(230 of 390 infants) and in 58.8% in the placebo 
group (223 of 379) (relative risk, 1.00; 95% CI, 
0.89 to 1.13; P 
= 
0.97). The mortality rate was 
higher in the budesonide group than in the pla-
cebo group (19.9% vs. 14.5%; relative risk, 1.37; 
95% CI, 1.01 to 1.86; P 
= 
0.04) (Table 3). Nine 
infants died after 36 weeks of postmenstrual 
age; of these infants, 8 (7 in the budesonide 
group and 1 in the placebo group) died before 
the initial hospital discharge. No single cause of 
death recorded on death certificates or on autopsy 
reports explained the difference in mortality be-
tween the two groups (Table S1 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix). No information about the 
survival status is available for the 43 infants who 
were lost to follow-up (24 assigned to budesonide 
and 19 assigned to placebo).
The groups did not differ significantly with 
respect to the rate of severe cognitive delay 
(Mental Development Index score <70) or of se-
vere cerebral palsy; the median Mental Develop-
ment Index and the Psychomotor Development 
Index scores on the Bayley scales; the rate of 
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; the average per-
centiles for height, weight, and head circumfer-
ence; hospital readmission rates; and receipt of 
pulmonary medications at a follow-up of 18 to 
22 months (Table 3). At the discretion of the local 
clinicians, 162 (24.2%) of 670 infants — 74 in 
the budesonide group and 88 in the placebo 
group — received inhaled glucocorticoids for at 
least 2 months after discharge from the hospital;

Discussion
In this large, multinational trial involving very-
high-risk, extremely preterm infants, we found 
no significant difference in the prespecified 
composite long-term outcome of neurodevelop-
mental impairment among survivors at a cor-
rected age of 18 to 22 months between infants 
randomly assigned to early treatment with 
budesonide and those assigned to placebo. There 
were no significant differences between the 
budesonide group and the placebo group with 
respect to the frequencies of the components of 
neurodevelopmental impairment, including cog-
nitive delay, cerebral palsy, hearing impairment, 
and blindness.
A Cochrane Collaboration systematic review 
of randomized trials of intravenous or oral gluco-
corticoids administered within the first 7 days 
of life to prevent chronic lung disease in preterm 
infants suggested that the early administration 
of dexamethasone may compromise brain devel-
opment and increase the risk of cerebral palsy.7 
These findings underline the need for long-term 
follow-up of preterm infants who are enrolled in 
studies investigating glucocorticoids, regardless 
of the method of administration. Among the 10 
trials included in a recent Cochrane systematic 
review of the administration of inhaled gluco-
corticoids within 2 weeks after birth, only 2 trial 
reports included information about long-term 
outcomes.17
One of these 2 trials, a randomized, con-
trolled trial of inhaled fluticasone as compared 
with placebo in infants with extremely low birth 
weight, showed no significant difference in the 
rate of death or neurodevelopmental impairment 
at 18 months of postmenstrual age among 187 
infants who were available for follow-up (relative 
risk with fluticasone vs. placebo, 1.09; 95% CI, 
0.70 to 1.70).18 The other randomized, controlled 
trial compared inhaled beclomethasone with 
placebo and assessed neurodevelopmental out-
comes in all 56 survivors to the age of 3 years.19 
There was no significant difference between 
those assigned to beclomethasone and those as-
signed to placebo in the incidence of cerebral 
palsy (relative risk, 1.33; 95% CI, 0.33 to 1.42) or 
in the incidence of Mental Development Index 
scores less than 2 SD below the mean (relative 
risk, 1.25; 95% CI, 0.37 to 4.17). The results of 
our trial, which included a larger sample, are 
consistent with these findings.
When we designed the trial, we did not antici-
pate an effect of inhaled budesonide on mortal-
ity, and thus our prespecified long-term com-
posite outcome did not include mortality as a 
component.13,14 However, at the time of assess-
ment of the primary outcome, budesonide was 
associated with a nonsignificant excess in mor-
tality.13 This unexpected finding prompted us to 
assess additional exploratory long-term outcomes,

Long-Term Effects of Inhaled Budesonide
including mortality at the time of the follow-up 
assessment and a composite outcome of death 
or severe neurodevelopmental disability. At a 
corrected age of 18 to 22 months, there was no 
significant difference between the budesonide 
group and the placebo group with respect to the 
composite outcome of death or neurodevelop-
mental disability, but the results of our analyses 
suggest higher mortality with budesonide. This 
finding was of nominal statistical significance 
and may have been due to chance; no adjustment 
was made in our analyses for multiple compari-
sons. Most infants had died in the first weeks of 
life; thus, the difference in mortality observed 
at a corrected age of 18 to 22 months largely 
reflected the differences in mortality before hos-
pital discharge that were reported previously13; 
among the 43 infants who were lost to follow-
up, survival status is unknown.

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
domized trials, involving a total of 1285 preterm 
infants, that assessed the early use of inhaled 
glucocorticoids as compared with placebo or no 
intervention did not show an increased risk of 
death by 36 weeks of postmenstrual age among 
all randomly assigned infants (pooled relative 
risk, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.82 to 1.40).17 Similarly, no 
significantly higher mortality with inhaled glu-
cocorticoids was reported in another systematic 
review that included randomized, placebo-con-
trolled trials of inhaled glucocorticoids for either 
the prevention or the treatment of bronchopul-
monary dysplasia.20 In an editorial accompany-
ing the publication of our primary outcome re-
sults, respiratory infections were suggested as a 
potential explanation for any excess in mortality 
in the glucocorticoid group,21 but a post hoc 
analysis of our data did not support this hypoth-
esis.22 The causes of death in our trial did not 
differ considerably between the groups.
Budesonide was not associated with a signifi-
cantly lower or higher risk of any outcome as-
sessed at follow-up except for mortality. Broncho-
pulmonary dysplasia is predictive of a poor 
long-term outcome,2,23 but although inhaled 
budesonide started in the first 24 hours of life 
resulted in a lower rate of bronchopulmonary 
dysplasia than placebo, there was no significant 
difference between the groups in adverse long-
term outcomes in our study. However, the fact 
that fewer infants died in the placebo group than 
in the budesonide group complicates the inter-
pretation of the treatment effect of budesonide.21
In summary, we found no effect of budesonide 
on the risk of neurodevelopmental disability 
among surviving extremely preterm infants at 
18 to 22 months of age. However, the mortality 
rate was higher in the budesonide group.
