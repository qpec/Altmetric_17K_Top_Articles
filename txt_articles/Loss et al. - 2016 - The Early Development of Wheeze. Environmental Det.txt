Abstract: RATIONALE: Growing up on a farm protects from childhood asthma and early wheeze. Virus-
triggered wheeze in infancy predicts asthma in individuals with a genetic asthma risk associated with
chromosome 17q21. OBJECTIVES: To test environmental determinants of infections and wheeze in the
first year of life, potential modifications of these associations by 17q21, and the implications for different
trajectories of wheeze. METHODS: We followed 983 children in rural areas of Europe from birth until
age 6 years. Symptoms of wheeze, rhinitis, fever, and environmental exposures were documented with
weekly diaries during year 1. Asthma at age 6 was defined as ever having a reported doctor’s diagnosis.
Single-nucleotide polymorphisms related to ORMDL3 (rs8076131) and GSDMB (rs7216389, rs2290400)
at 17q21 were genotyped.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Early wheeze was positively
associated with presence of older siblings among carriers of known asthma risk alleles at 17q21 (e.g.,
rs8076131) (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.53; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.16-2.01). Exposure to farm
animal sheds was inversely related to wheeze (aOR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.33-0.60). Both effects were similarly
observed in children with transient wheeze up to age 3 years without subsequent development of asthma
(aOR, 1.71 [95% CI, 1.09-2.67]; and aOR, 0.48 [95% CI, 0.30-0.76], respectively).
CONCLUSIONS:
These findings suggest that the chromosome 17q21 locus relates to episodes of acute airway obstruction
common to both transient wheeze and asthma. The previously identified asthma risk alleles are the
ones susceptible to environmental influences. Thus, this gene-environment interaction reveals two faces
of 17q21: The same genotype constitutes genetic risk and allows for environmental protection, thereby
providing options for prospective prevention strategies.

Abstract
Rationale: Growing up on a farm protects from childhood asthma
and early wheeze. Virus-triggered wheeze in infancy predicts
asthma in individuals with a genetic asthma risk associated with
chromosome 17q21.
Objectives: To test environmental determinants of infections and
wheeze in the first year of life, potential modifications of these
associations by 17q21, and the implications for different trajectories
of wheeze.
Methods: We followed 983 children in rural areas of Europe
from birth until age 6 years. Symptoms of wheeze, rhinitis,

with weekly diaries during year 1. Asthma at age 6 was
defined as ever having a reported doctor’s diagnosis.
Single-nucleotide polymorphisms related to ORMDL3

Measurements and Main Results: Early wheeze was positively
associated with presence of older siblings among carriers of known
asthma risk alleles at 17q21 (e.g., rs8076131) (adjusted odds ratio
[aOR], 1.53; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.16–2.01). Exposure

Among the environmental determinants of
asthma and allergies, protective effects of
growing up on a farm have been found with
exceptionally high consistency (1). It has often
been suggested that this exposure operates
already very early in life; however, this
hypothesis was based only on retrospective
analyses of cross-sectional studies (1). The
PASTURE (Protection against Allergy
Study in Rural Environments) birth cohort
provides a unique opportunity to study this
hypothesis in a longitudinal setting (2).

889
 Environmental exposures and respiratory
symptoms such as wheeze, rhinitis, and fever
have been registered meticulously with
weekly diaries throughout the first year of
life. In this population, we have previously
found protective effects of consumption of
unprocessed cow’s milk on infections of the
upper but not the lower respiratory tract
in the first year of life (3). In the present
study, we focused on the other major
farm-related exposure: regular stays in animal
sheds (4). This implies exposure to inhalable
dust particles of plant, animal, and
microbial origin, which might affect
particularly the lower airways.
Farming exposure has also been found
to protect from early transient wheeze (5, 6).
This wheeze phenotype is triggered by
viral infections and mostly disappears by
age 3–4 years with the maturation of
adaptive immunity. Viral infections have
been implicated in promoting childhood
asthma (7, 8), possibly by repetitively
damaging the airway epithelium (9).
However, early episodes of viral wheeze
were shown to predispose to asthma only in
individuals with a genetic asthma risk
associated with the chromosome 17q21
locus (10). This locus harboring the
coexpressed genes ORMDL3 and GSDMB
is well recognized as a major genetic risk
locus for childhood-onset asthma, but its
physiologic function remains elusive (11).
Some clues, however, may be gained by
studying how environmental factors impact
the association of the 17q21 locus with
asthma. The aim of the present analyses
was to test environmental determinants of
infections and wheeze in the first year of
life, potential modifications of these
associations by 17q21, and the implications
for different trajectories of wheeze.
Some of the results of these studies have
been reported previously in the form of
a late-breaking abstract (12).
Methods
The methods of this study are described
in detail in the online supplement. The
PASTURE birth cohort was derived from
rural areas of Austria, Finland, France,
Germany, and Switzerland (2). Pregnant
women were recruited during their third
trimester, and their children were followed
until the age of 6 years. Half of these
women lived and worked on livestock
farms. The study was approved by the
local research ethics committees in each
country, and written informed consent
was obtained from all parents.
Questionnaire information on lifestyle
and parental background was obtained
within the third trimester of pregnancy,
when the child was 2 months of age, and
every year from age 1 to 6 (6). Additional
information on occurrence of infections
and farm-related exposures such as animal
sheds, as well as on feeding practices, was
collected from weekly and 4-weekly
diaries between 8 and 53 weeks of life.
In total, 983 individuals (i.e., 87% of the
originally included 1,133 children) (6)
were included in this analysis with 37,306
person-weeks of observation in the first
year of life. In a subsample of 791 children

At a Glance Commentary
Scientific Knowledge on the
Subject: Exposure to farming
protects from asthma and transient
wheeze. Polymorphisms at the 17q21
locus are associated with childhood-
onset asthma, particularly in children
experiencing virus-triggered wheeze
episodes in early infancy.
What This Study Adds to the
Field: Exposure to animal sheds
reduces the risk of wheeze episodes in
the first year of life independently from
asthma at school age. This effect was
restricted exactly to a genotype at
17q21 that has previously been shown
to increase the risk of asthma.
Individuals with this susceptible
genotype might profit from protective
environmental exposures in the face of
their genetic risk of wheeze and
asthma.

 (SNPs) at the 17q21 asthma susceptibility
locus, specifically SNP rs8076131 in the
ORMDL3 gene and SNPs rs2290400 and
rs7216389 in the GSDMB gene, were
genotyped in cord blood as described
before (6). At the 6-year follow-up, data
on asthma among 863 children (87.8%)
were obtained.
Early wheeze, rhinitis (a runny nose
or common cold), and fever (measured
temperature, >38.58C) were defined as any
occurrence during the previous 7 days as
registered in the weekly diaries. Asthma at
age 6 years was defined as a parent-reported
physician’s diagnosis of asthma at least
once per lifetime or spastic, obstructive,
or asthmatic bronchitis at least twice.
Transient wheeze was defined as any
wheeze in the first 3 years of life but not
beyond.
Statistical Analyses
The analyses were restricted to participants
with complete information in more than
20 weekly diaries corresponding to half
of the average number of completed weekly
diaries during the first year. The median
number of completed weekly diaries was
42 weeks (interquartile range, 40–44 wk).
We did not find synchronized patterns
between comparable variables in weekly
or 4-weekly diaries, indicating good
compliance with weekly documentation.
Repeated measurements of exposures
and outcomes from weekly diaries were
aggregated, and the resulting summary
statistics of presence or absence during
the first year of life as well as the genetic
data were related to occurrence of asthma
at age 6 years using logistic regression
modeling adjusted for siblings; farming;
country; sex; parental history of asthma,
hay fever, or atopic dermatitis; maternal
education; and environmental tobacco
smoke (ETS).
Generalized estimating equations
(GEEs) with an autoregressive correlation
structure were used to compute associations
of weekly repeated measurements of animal
shed exposure with wheeze, rhinitis, and
fever during the first year of life. Exposure to
animal sheds was defined as the child’s
having been taken during the previous
7 days to a cow, pig, or horse stable; a poultry
shed; or a barn. For each of these items, the
time in hours per week was also reported.
Covariables were selected a priori and
included siblings; country; sex; parental
history of asthma, hay fever, or atopic
dermatitis; maternal education; birth
mode; birth weight; exposure to dogs and
cats, ETS; duration of breastfeeding;
introduction of complementary foods
during the first year of life (13); type of
cow’s milk consumed (3); and seasons of
sampling. Age was entered as a continuous
variable in weeks plus a multiplicative
interaction term with country to account
for time-dependent variations in wheeze
prevalence across countries. Day care
attendance and consumption of infant

 formula during the first year of life did
not confound the presented analyses.
Results from logistic and GEE models
were expressed as adjusted odds ratios
(aORs). Plotted probabilities of infections
over the first year of life were derived from
GEE models. A sensitivity analysis
performed to calculate relative risk ratios
by GEE using Poisson instead of logistic
models led to the same conclusions.
Meta-analytical techniques were used to test
heterogeneity of effects between countries
in the first year of life. Interactions were
tested using multiplicative interaction terms
in the respective models. All estimates
(b, aOR, risk ratio) are given with 95%
confidence intervals (CIs). All statistical
analyses were performed using STATA 13.1
software (StataCorp, College Station, TX).
Results
Sociodemographic factors of the study
population of 983 children are given in
Table 1. Children with assessment of
asthma at age 6 years were characterized
by higher maternal age and more cesarean
sections compared with children with no
information on asthma (see Table E1 in
the online supplement). The subsample
with genetic data was enriched for female
sex and spontaneous mode of delivery
(Table E2). Farming was associated with
more older siblings, more pets, higher
birth weight, less parental atopic disease,
and lower maternal education (data not
shown).
Early wheeze occurred at least once in
35% of study participants, with a prevalence
peak in winter. Two-thirds of wheeze
episodes were accompanied by reports of a
common cold, and 23% were accompanied
by fever. Wheeze, rhinitis, and fever in
the first year of life were positively related
to the presence of older siblings and

 inversely associated with farm exposure,
particularly exposure to animal sheds.
Exposure to pets was inversely related to
rhinitis and, in the case of dogs, also to
wheeze (Table 2). The effects of animal
shed exposure on early wheeze, rhinitis, and
fever were strongest when occurring in
the same week; time lags between exposure
and outcome of 1 or more weeks in both
directions weakened the associations. The
information on animal shed exposure was
available for three subcategories: cow, pig,
or horse stables; poultry sheds; and barns.
A sensitivity analysis mutually adjusting
these items revealed a consistent effect of
cow, pig, or horse stables on wheeze,
rhinitis, and fever, whereas exposure to
barns did not exert an effect on wheeze
(Table E3).
In contrast to rhinitis and fever, early
wheeze was also associated with three
SNPs on the 17q21 locus. The associations
were much stronger in individuals who
eventually developed asthma up to age
6 years, but they were absent in children
without subsequent asthma (Table 3).
When we looked at this interaction of
17q21, wheeze, and asthma from a different
angle, we found that a genetic risk for
asthma at the 17q21 locus was present only
in children who experienced wheeze during
the first year of life (Figure 1).
We next tested whether this genotype
interacted for wheeze in year 1 with its
environmental determinants. We found
that presence of older siblings and
exposure to animal sheds were associated
with wheeze only in carriers of the
asthma risk genotype rs8076131-AA/GA,
whereas exposure to dogs did not interact
with this genotype (Figure 2). In the
susceptible genotype, the risk effect of

 presence of older siblings and the
protective effect of exposure to animal
sheds were more pronounced between ages
30 and 43 weeks (i.e., 7 and 10 months,
respectively); in the insusceptible genotype,
however, no effect was noted, as shown
by continuously overlapping confidence
bands (Figure 3).
Presence of siblings made a qualitative
difference, and the effect was not related
to the sibship size in the susceptible
genotype (data not shown). The animal
shed exposure, however, showed a
dose–response relationship with the time
spent weekly in animal sheds in the
susceptible genotype; an exposure time of
2 or more hours per week, corresponding
to about 20 minutes per day on average,
reduced the risk of wheeze attacks in the
susceptible genotype by more than 80%,
whereas in the insusceptible genotype
even the most time-intensive exposure
did not exert an effect (Figure 4). The
associations of wheeze with presence of
older siblings and exposure to animal
sheds in the susceptible genotype were
homogeneous across countries, as shown
by low I2 values (Figure 5). The
environmental determinants interacted
with each other in the susceptible genotype;
in children with animal shed exposure,
the effect of older siblings was absent
(aOR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.62–1.49; P = 0.049
for interaction).
Finally, we tested whether the
environmental effects on wheeze in the first
year of life in the group with the susceptible
genotype also operated in children who
lost wheeze symptoms after their third
birthday (i.e., in children with the transient
wheeze phenotype). As shown in Table 4,
the effects of both presence of older siblings
and exposure to animal sheds were also
present in the stratum of children who
stopped wheezing by age 3 years; in the case
of presence of older siblings the effect was
somewhat stronger than among children
who continued wheezing until age 6 years.
As expected on the basis of the high linkage
disequilibrium of the three 17q21 SNPs
(Table E4), the interactions of the
environmental exposures with the two
GSMDL SNPs were similar to those of
the ORMDL3 SNP rs8076131 (Tables E5
and E6).
In this rural population, ETS exposure
was quite rare (8.3%), only moderately
associated with early wheeze (aOR, 1.42;
95% CI, 1.04–1.92), and did not interact
with 17q21 (P = 0.731). ETS was not
associated with asthma and did not affect
other associations tested, and numbers of
smokers were too low to test interactions
with genotype (data not shown).
Discussion
The main findings of this analysis were
associations of wheeze, rhinitis, and fever
in the first year with environmental
determinants such as exposure to farming,
exposure to pets, and presence of siblings.
In addition, wheeze was determined by
genetic polymorphisms at the 17q21
locus, particularly in children who
developed asthma by age 6 years. Moreover,
this locus interacted with presence of
siblings and exposure to animal sheds in
that these environmental exposures
exerted their effects only in the genotype
previously related to asthma risk. The
latter associations were also present
in children who stopped wheezing by
age 3 years and thus did not develop
asthma.
A major strength of this study is the
health diaries, which facilitated prompt and
complete recording of disease occurrence
and related exposures on a weekly basis
throughout the entire period of 10 months.
The absence of synchronized patterns
between weekly or 4-weekly diaries argues
against retrospective completion of
questionnaires, thereby supporting high
data quality. The concomitant recording
of exposures and outcomes in diaries is
unlikely to constitute a source of reverse
causation, for the following reasons. First,
the effect of animal shed exposures on
wheeze was restricted to a distinct genotype
at the 17q21 locus, and children are brought
to the animal shed regardless of their
genotype, which is unknown to their
parents. Second, the interaction with animal
shed was specific; exposure to pets did
not interact. Third, the association was
specific for animal shed exposure; barn
exposure hardly affected wheeze. Fourth, the
dose dependency of the effect of animal
shed exposure constitutes a strong criterion
for causality.
Admittedly, viral triggers of wheeze
episodes were not specified by polymerase
chain reaction. However, we confirmed
the interaction of wheeze with the
chromosome 17q21 locus for asthma
(Figure 1), which has previously been
reported for wheeze episodes with
polymerase chain reaction–based detection
of human rhinovirus and other viruses (10).
Moreover, the number of respiratory
episodes rather than specific viral agents
may determine the subsequent

 development of asthma (14), which
relativizes the value of identifying the viral
triggers of wheeze episodes.
In this study, we focused on a very early
phase of wheeze development. In the first
year of life, wheeze is highly prevalent
(35% in our cohort). In contrast, only 7.6%
of children develop asthma up to age 6 years
(Figure 1), thereby rendering the transient
character of early wheeze obvious for the
vast majority of cases and suggesting an
association with viral respiratory infections.
Among the environmental determinants of
early wheeze, we found the presence of
siblings to increase the risk of wheeze. In
the framework of the hygiene hypothesis,
the presence of siblings has been
interpreted as a source of viral infections
(15). The particularly strong effect of
siblings in the stratum of transient
wheezers (Table 4) and the interaction with
the genotype in this stratum (Table E6)
may support this notion. However, the
presence of older siblings might also point
to immunological mechanisms related
to the intrauterine milieu. Previous
pregnancies might drive the maternal
immune system toward a more tolerant
status, which might impact the early
immune development of the younger
children in that they are more susceptible to
infections but less prone to atopy.
Alternatively, older siblings might also
impact the microbial colonization of the
younger child (16). This assumption,
however, seems to conflict with the
protective effect of pets, which might
similarly affect the microbial environment
and colonization of the infant (17).
Exposure to microbial stimuli might foster
the development of the immune system,
resulting in a powerful immune response
to viral infections but without clinical
manifestation of symptoms.
An analogous phenomenon might be
observed with farm exposure. Farm
children live in larger families and more
frequently have siblings; thus, viral exposure
is as least as common as in non-farm
children. Consequently, the farm exposure
may relate to the child’s ability to repress
symptoms of viral respiratory infections.
Playing in animal sheds, children inhale
a complex mixture of microorganisms and
bioactive compounds from animals as
well as the animals’ bedding and fodder.
Small particles heavily loaded with
environmental bacteria and fungi (18),
pollen allergens, or other relevant
compounds enter the airways and
may directly impact the respiratory
system by triggering receptors of the
innate immunity (19, 20) or by altering
the composition of the lung microbiome.
This notion is supported by experimental
evidence derived from animal models
where protection from eosinophilic
airway inflammation and airway
hyperresponsiveness was achieved by
exposure to bacteria and fungi (21–24)
and by exposure to arabinogalactan,
an oligosaccharide found in grass and
hay (25).
In two independent studies, we
previously found an inverse relation of farm
exposure and transient wheeze (5, 6), which
implies specific protection against viral
respiratory infections or alleviation of the
symptoms. One might argue that viral
infections just unmask an underlying defect
of the physical barrier or the local
immunity of the asthmatic airway mucosa
without causally contributing to the
development of asthma (26). This would
imply, however, that the associations of
viral infections and early wheeze were
present mainly in individuals who
subsequently developed asthma. The
present analysis, however, clearly showed
a protective effect of animal shed
exposure on wheeze in children who

 outgrew wheezing episodes by age 3 years
and did not develop asthma. This
indicates that the animal shed exposure
also operates in children without any
asthma predisposition or atopic condition
and supports a genuine effect on
virus-triggered wheeze episodes.
Previously, we failed to detect any
interactions of farm-related exposures with
major asthma loci in a genome-wide
gene–environment interaction analysis for
childhood asthma in schoolchildren,
despite substantial statistical power (27, 28).
The recognition of gene–environment
interactions with 17q21 in the present study
suggests that we previously missed the
appropriate time window of early infancy.
Moreover, these interactions may provide
a key to the physiologic function of the
17q21 locus and its role in the development
of asthma (i.e., predisposing the lower
airways to react with acute obstruction to
common viral infections). Similarly, the
specific association of 17q21 with onset of
wheeze before age 4 years points to
increased vulnerability in early childhood
(29). During this time window, intensive
maturation of the adaptive immunity
occurs, in addition to substantial lung
growth with a faster increase in lung
volume than in airway caliber (30). The
notion of hampered lung development is
supported by the previously reported
three-way interaction (29, 31) of genotype,
viral infections, and ETS, which in itself
impairs lung development. Beyond infancy
and before school age, wheeze may
gradually become more independent of
viral triggers and may reflect a response
characteristic of an airway system primed
for asthma possibly promoted by atopic
sensitization (6). Additionally, the
association of 17q21 with inflammatory
diseases of other organ systems, such as
inflammatory bowel disease and ankylosing
spondylitis (32), suggests that inflammatory
processes are insufficiently contained in
susceptible individuals.
So far, the genetic risk constituted by
the 17q21 locus has been seen as a
determinant hardly modifiable by preventive
or therapeutic measures. The discovery
of these impressive gene–environment
interactions may change this perception,
however. Owing to a minor allele frequency
of about 50% and a dominant effect, three-
fourths of a population seems to be amenable
to environmental prevention either despite
or actually because of their underlying
genotype.
The restriction of the animal shed effect
to the susceptible 17q21 genotype implies
that the genotype itself may be taken as
a proxy for the environmental exposure.
This situation corresponds to Mendelian
randomization, a technique making use of
the blinded random allocation of genotypes
during meiosis and thereby mimicking the
design of a randomized controlled trial in an
observational setting. In this sense, the
present findings about the protective
potential of animal shed exposure achieve a
rather high level of evidence. Nevertheless,
clinical trials are necessary to confirm the
effectiveness of reducing asthma risk by
preventing early respiratory infections.
Treatment of respiratory syncytial virus
infection indeed reduced risk of wheezing
(33); however, other viral infections (14)
should be targeted as well. In the future,
isolation of the active principle of animal
shed dust may provide a means for
naturally controlling viral infections or
enhancing the viral defense of children at
risk of severe airway disease.
Taking all of our data together, we
found environmental determinants of
wheeze in infancy. The corresponding
effects were restricted to a genotype encoded
at the 17q21 locus that was previously
related to risk of childhood-onset asthma. In
the susceptible genotype, the environmental
exposures of presence of siblings and
exposure to animal sheds also impacted
transient wheeze without subsequent
development of asthma. Exposure to animal
sheds may reduce genetically determined
asthma risk by promoting the individual’s
capability of coping with early viral
infections. Altogether these findings reveal
the dual nature of the relationship between
17q variants and childhood asthma: The
same genotype that constitutes genetic risk
is amenable to environmental protection
and may respond to future prevention
strategies. n
