Abstract
Importance—As perinatally HIV-infected youth (PHIVY) in the US grow older and more 
treatment-experienced, clinicians need updated information about the impact of age, CD4 count, 
viral load (VL), and antiretroviral drug (ARV) use on risks of opportunistic infections (OIs), key 
clinical events, and mortality in order to understand patient risks and improve care.

 Objective—To determine the incidence or first occurrence during follow-up of key clinical 
events (including CDC-B and CDC-C events) and mortality among PHIVY stratified by age, CD4, 
and VL/ARV status.
Design—In the PHACS Adolescent Master Protocol (AMP) and IMPAACT P1074 multicenter 
cohort studies (2007–2015), we estimated event rates during person-time spent in key strata of age 
(7–12, 13–17, and 18–30 years), CD4 count (<200, 200–499, and ≥500 cells/μL), and VL/ARV 
status (< or ≥ 400 copies/mL; ARVs or no ARVs).
Setting—41 ambulatory sites in the US, including Puerto Rico.
Participants—1,562 participants in AMP and P1074 were eligible, 1446 PHIVY were included.
Exposure(s) for observational studies—Age, CD4 count, VL, ARV use.
Main outcomes—Clinical event rates stratified by person-time in age, CD4 count, and VL/ARV 
categories.
Results—During a mean follow-up of 4.9 years, higher incidences of CDC-B events, CDC-C 
events and mortality were observed as participants aged. Older PHIVY (13–17 and 18–30 year-
olds) spent more time with VL ≥400 copies/mL and with CD4 <200/μL compared to 7–12 year-
olds (30% and 44% vs. 22% of person-time with VL ≥400 copies/mL; 5% and 18% vs. 2% of 
person-time with CD4 <200/μL; p<0.01 for each comparison). We observed higher rates of CDC-
B events, CDC-C events, bacterial infections, and mortality at lower CD4 counts, as expected. The 
mortality rate in older PHIVY was 6–12 times that of the general US population. Higher rates of 
sexually transmitted infections were also observed at lower CD4 counts, after adjusting for age.
Conclusions and relevance—Older PHIVY were at increased risk of viremia, 
immunosuppression, CDC-B events, CDC-C events, and mortality. Interventions to improve ART 
adherence and optimize models of care for PHIVY as they age are urgently needed to improve 
long-term outcomes among PHIVY.

INTRODUCTION
Effective interventions to prevent mother-to-child HIV transmission and treat HIV-infected 
infants and children have shifted the US pediatric HIV epidemic; youth aged ≥13 years now 
represent the majority of perinatally HIV-infected youth (PHIVY) in the US.1–3 Rates of 
viremia and immunosuppression have decreased among PHIVY in the US since the 
implementation of effective combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), but may remain 
higher for older PHIVY.4,5 Compared to adults, PHIVY experience lower rates of HIV RNA 
viral load (VL) suppression and higher rates of loss to follow-up.6–8 As youth age and 
transition to adult care, their risks of opportunistic infections (OI), other serious clinical 
events, and mortality are not well described.9–14
Understanding the frequency of important clinical events for PHIVY, as well as the 
consequences of being prescribed cART without a suppressed VL, will provide critical

 information to design interventions for this group, who are at risk for severe illness, 
accumulation of resistance mutations, and secondary transmission.15,16 Our objectives were 
to determine the frequency of viremia and immunosuppression among PHIVY and young 
adults aged 7–30 years engaged in care in two large national cohort studies and to analyze 
associations between age, CD4 count, viremia, ARV use, and risks of significant clinical 
events and mortality.
METHODS
Study Population
We evaluated participants in the Pediatric HIV/AIDS Cohort Study (PHACS) Adolescent 
Master Protocol (AMP) and the International Maternal Pediatric Adolescent AIDS Clinical 
Trials (IMPAACT) P1074 cohort studies. AMP enrolled 451 PHIVY aged 7–16 years 
between March 2007 and November 2009 at 15 US sites; follow-up is ongoing.2 P1074 
enrolled 1,201 participants (87% PHIVY) with a mean age of 17.4 years (SD 5.4) between 
April 2009 and June 2013 at 40 US sites; follow-up was completed in June 2014.17 For this 
analysis, AMP participants were eligible if they had ≥1 visits between March 2007 and April 
2015, and ≥1 CD4 and VL recorded after baseline; P1074 participants were eligible if they 
were PHIVY and had ≥1 chart abstraction with CD4 count and VL data recorded after 
baseline. AMP baseline was defined as date of study entry; P1074 baseline was defined as 1 
year prior to study entry. Simultaneous co-enrollment in AMP and P1074 was not permitted. 
Based on guidelines, practice patterns, and trial data, we defined cART regimens as one of 
three mutually exclusive types expected to be suppressive: (1) ≥3 drugs from ≥2 classes, or 
(2) a protease inhibitor (PI, excluding ritonavir alone) + 1 drug from another class, or (3) ≥3 
nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitors.2,18–22 We excluded person-time when patients 
had VL <400 copies/mL and were not prescribed ARVs and when patients had VL ≥400 
copies/mL while being prescribed an ARV regimen other than cART. Although individual 
patient circumstances may have warranted these approaches, they are not expected to 
suppress VL and were not standard of care during the study period.2,18–22 Lost to follow-up 
was defined as stopping data collection for any reason other than death, study completion, or 
site closure.
Clinical and Laboratory Data
Participant consent and data collection methods have been described previously for both 
studies.2,17 CD4 counts, VLs, ARV use, and clinical events were abstracted from medical 
records, and clinical events were coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA) version 18 by Frontier Science Technology and Research 
Foundation.23
Outcome Measures
Primary outcomes included mortality and first occurrence of CDC stage C/WHO stage 4 or 
CDC stage B/WHO stage 3 events during follow-up.24–27 Secondary outcomes included: 
bacterial pneumonia; serious bacterial infections; presumptive pelvic inflammatory disease 
(PID); other sexually transmitted infections (STI); pregnancy; mental health and 
neurodevelopmental conditions; asthma, atopy or allergy conditions; gastrointestinal

 conditions; cardiac conditions; anemia; pancreatitis or hepatitis; peripheral neuropathy; and 
metabolic or bone abnormalities, including renal conditions. Presumptive PID and 
pregnancy were limited to females aged ≥13; other STIs were limited to age ≥13 and 
stratified by sex due to sex-specific screening practices. Each MedDRA term was assigned a 
single diagnostic category, except for bacterial pneumonia and PID which were included in 
CDC-B/WHO-3 events, and also examined separately.
Statistical Analyses
We estimated incidence rates of key clinical events, stratified by the combination of time-
varying age (7–12, 13–17, and 18–30 years), CD4 count (<200, 200–499, and ≥500/μL), and 
VL/ARV status. VL/ARV status was categorized as: 1) suppressive ARVs: VL <400 
copies/mL and prescribed any ARVs, 2) non-suppressive cART: VL ≥400 copies/mL and 
prescribed cART, and 3) no ARVs: VL ≥400 copies/mL and not prescribed any ARVs.
We estimated incidence rates and assessed trends by age, CD4 count, and VL/ARV 
categories using Poisson regression models, accounting for within-subject correlation with 
robust standard variance estimators. For selected individual events (STIs, pregnancy and 
cardiac events), incidence rates by CD4 counts were adjusted for age using inverse 
probability weighting because person-time contributing to each age category was unevenly 
distributed by CD4 category.28–33 Only the first occurrence of each event after baseline for 
each participant was included.
To assign participants to baseline strata and calculate the total person-time contributed by all 
participants to each stratum, we used linear interpolation between adjacent CD4 and log10-
transformed VL readings, and estimated dates when strata thresholds were crossed. The 
nearest CD4 and VL readings prior to baseline were used when available for interpolation, 
and last available CD4 count and VL were carried forward until the end of follow-up.
We used weighted repeated measures generalized estimating equation (GEE) models with an 
independence working correlation, identity link, normal distribution and robust variance 
estimators to determine the association between: age and person-time with VL ≥400 
copies/mL, age and person-time with CD4 <200/μL, and VL/ARV status and person-time 
with CD4 <200/μL. For these GEE analyses, we additionally sub-divided the older age 
stratum into 18–21, 22–25, and 26–30 years.
To compare mortality rates between PHIVY and youth in the general US population, we 
calculated standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) standardized to CDC age, sex and race 
distributions.34 Confidence intervals (CI) for SMRs were calculated using the Boice-
Monson method.
RESULTS
Characteristics of the study population
Of 1,467 PHIVY in AMP and/or P1074, we excluded 18 who did not have the combination 
of ARV, CD4 count and VL data at any point during follow-up, 1 who spent their entire 
person-time in the study with VL ≥400 while on a regimen other than cART, and 2 who

 spent their entire person-time with VL <400 and off ARVs. We excluded 92.3 person-years 
(PY) (1.4% of overall person-time) while participants were viremic and on a regimen other 
than cART and 59.4 PY (0.9% of overall person-time) while participants had VL <400 
copies/mL while off ARVs, from a total of 247 participants. Table 1 reports additional 
baseline and follow-up characteristics. Mean age at baseline was 14.6 years, with 52% 
female participants; 66% identified as black, and 26% identified as Hispanic. Notably, 
patients who were lost to follow-up differed significantly from retained patients only in 
baseline age (15.8 vs. 14.4 years).
Distribution of person-time
Participants contributed 19% of person-time between ages 7–12, 38% between 13–17, and 
43% between 18–30; only 2% of total person-time was between ages 26–30 (Table 2). The 
majority of person-time was spent with CD4 counts ≥500/μL (65% of person-time, 
compared to 24% at 200–499/μL and 10% at <200/μL), and on suppressive ARVs (66% of 
person-time, compared to 28% on non-suppressive cART and 7% on no ARVs). Person-
years spent in older age strata (ages 13–17 and 18–30), compared to ages 7–12, were more 
likely to be spent with CD4 counts <200/μL (5% and 18% vs. 2%, p<0.001 for each pair-
wise comparison). For older PHIVY (age ≥18), more person-time was also spent with VL 
≥400 copies/mL (either non-suppressive cART or no ARVs, 30% and 44% vs. 22% of 
person-time, p<0.001 for both). When the older age stratum was further divided into 18–21, 
22–25, and 26–30 years, proportions of time spent being viremic and with low CD4 counts 
remained substantially higher for each sub-stratum compared to younger ages (Table 3). Use 
of non-suppressive cART was not associated with having CD4 <200/μL, compared to use of 
no ARVs (25% vs. 24%, p=0.72).
Mortality
Overall, there were 29 deaths (0.4/100PY) (eTables 1–4). Seventy-nine percent of deaths 
occurred at CD4 <200/μL (3.5/100PY). Eighty-three percent of deaths occurred while VL 
was ≥400 copies/mL, with mortality rates of 0.9/100PY for non-suppressive cART and 
1.6/100PY for no ARVs (p<0.001 for trend). All but one death (97%) occurred in 18–30 
year olds (1.0/100PY, p<0.001 for trend). PHIVY between ages 15–19 and 20–29 had 5.6-
fold (95%CI: 2.8–11.1) and 12.3-fold (95%CI: 8.0–18.9) higher mortality rates than youth 
of the same age in the US general population, respectively.34
First events during follow-up
CDC-C/WHO-4 events—There were 86 CDC-C/WHO-4 events (1.4/100PY; eTable 5). 
Higher rates of CDC-C/WHO-4 events were observed at lower CD4 counts (<200/μL: 
9.6/100PY; 200–499/μL: 1.0/100PY; ≥500/μL: 0.4/100PY; p<0.001 for trend). Of 17 events 
that occurred at CD4 counts ≥500/μL (20% of total), only 2 were OIs (pulmonary 
tuberculosis and ocular toxoplasmosis); others were HIV-related kidney and cardiac disease. 
Higher rates of CDC-C/WHO-4 events occurred with higher VL (suppressive ARVs: 
0.6/100PY; non-suppressive cART: 3.0/100PY; no ARVs: 2.4/100PY; p<0.001 for trend). 
Higher rates of CDC-C/WHO-4 events were also observed with older age (7–12: 0.7/100PY; 
13–17: 0.9/100PY; 18–30: 2.1/100PY; p<0.001 for trend).

 CDC B/WHO-3 events—There were 193 CDC-B/WHO-3 events (3.2/100PY; Figures 1 
and 2; eTable 6). Higher rates of CDC-B/WHO-3 events were observed at lower CD4 counts 
(<200/μL: 12.5/100PY; 200–499/μL: 3.8/100PY; ≥500/μL: 1.8/100PY; p<0.001 for trend). 
CDC-B/WHO-3 events were also more common at higher VL (suppressive ARVs: 
2.0/100PY; non-suppressive cART: 5.5/100PY; no ARVs: 7.1/100PY; p<0.001 for trend). 
These event rates also increased as participants aged (7–12: 2.4/100PY; 13–17: 2.9/100PY; 
18–30: 3.9/100PY; p=0.01 for trend). For bacterial pneumonia (CDC-B/WHO-3 event) and 
serious bacterial infections, higher event rates were also observed at lower CD4 counts and 
higher viral loads, but no trends were observed by age (eTables 7 and 8).
Reproductive system events—In female participants, higher rates of presumptive PID, 
other STIs, and pregnancies were observed with older age and with VL >400 copies/mL 
(eTables 9–11); higher rates of STIs (not including PID) and pregnancy were observed with 
lower CD4 counts. After adjusting for age, the association between increasing rates of 
pregnancies and lower CD4 counts no longer reached significance (<200/μL: 4.5/100PY; 
200–499/μL: 4.8/100PY; ≥500/μL: 2.8/100PY; p=0.18); however, the trend of increased rates 
of first female STI at lower CD4 counts remained significant (<200/μL: 8.1/100PY; 200–
499/μL: 5.9/100PY; ≥500/μL: 3.1/100PY; p<0.001). First STIs were infrequently reported in 
males (eTable 12).
Other clinical events—Mental health and neurodevelopmental conditions were among 
the most frequent conditions (4.0/100PY); no trends were observed by age, CD4 count, or 
VL/ARV strata (eTable 13). For asthma, atopy or allergy conditions, no trends were 
observed by age, CD4 count or VL/ARV strata (eTable 14). For gastrointestinal conditions, 
rates increased with lower CD4 counts (p<0.001); however, no trends were observed by age 
or VL/ARV strata (eTable 15). Higher rates of first non-AIDS-defining cardiac events were 
observed at lower CD4 counts (eTable 16), although this trend was no longer significant 
after adjusting for age (<200/μL: 2.1/100PY; 200–499/μL: 1.0/100PY; ≥500/μL: 0.7/100PY; 
p=0.08). Events potentially attributed to antiretroviral toxicity such as anemia (0.0/100PY), 
pancreatitis or hepatitis (0.4/100PY) and peripheral neuropathy (0.2/100PY) were among the 
least frequently reported events (eTables 17–19). Rates of first metabolic or bone 
abnormalities (1.5/100PY) showed no difference by age or CD4 count, but trended towards 
lower rates in patients with VL >400 copies/mL (suppressive ARVs: 1.7/100PY; non-
suppressive cART: 1.1/100PY; no ARVs: 0.7/100PY; p=0.04) (eTable 20).
DISCUSSION
We analyzed rates of clinical events and mortality during 6,548 person-years of follow-up 
from 1,446 PHIVY aged 7–30 years in the AMP and P1074 cohort studies, stratified by 
time-updated age, CD4 count, and VL/ARV status. There were three key findings from this 
work. First, older youth were at highest risk for viremia, low CD4 counts, and serious 
clinical events, including mortality, CDC-C/WHO-4, and CDC-B/WHO-3 events. Viral load 
monitoring remained consistent across age ranges, suggesting ongoing engagement in care; 
high overall rates of viremia in participants aged 18–30 years are likely therefore due to 
suboptimal medication adherence or acceptance, or accumulated HIV viral resistance. Older 
PHIVY had greater early exposure to mono- or dual-regimens compared to younger PHIVY;

 the lack of viral suppression among those PHIVY prescribed cART is more likely related to 
poor medication adherence or acceptance, as resistance to newer ARVs, such as integrase 
inhibitors, is uncommon.35 Older youth also spent more time with CD4 counts <200/μL. 
Data from PHIVY aged 6–17 suggest that having CD4 counts <200/μL is associated with 
lower quality of life, psychiatric symptoms, and poor cognitive, academic, and social 
functioning, and data from adults suggest high risks of OIs and death.36,37 Our findings are 
consistent with a growing literature outlining the challenges to adhering to medications for 
PHIVY in adolescence, which intensify as PHIVY reach early adulthood38–43
Second, we observed relatively few clinical events and deaths during the follow-up period, 
during which cART was standard of care. These results add to prior reports of clinical events 
in AMP and P1074 by stratifying clinical event rates by time-updated age, CD4, and 
VL/ARV status.1,17 Our results are similar to other cohort studies of PHIVY in the US, UK 
and Ireland.9,13,44 For example, our observed incidence rates of mortality (0.4/100 PY), 
CDC-C/WHO-4 events (1.4/100 PY), CDC-B/WHO-3 events (3.2/100 PY), and bacterial 
pneumonia (1.4/100 PY) were comparable to those reported in the PACTG 219c cohort in 
2006, 10 years into the cART-era (mortality: 0.5–0.8/100 PY; CDC-C: 1.5/100 PY; CDC-B: 
5.0/100 PY; bacterial pneumonia 2.2/100 PY).5,12,44 However, the mortality rate in older 
adolescent (ages 15–19) and young adult (ages 20–29) PHIVY remained 6 and 12 times that 
of the US general population, respectively, after accounting for age, sex, and race. STIs 
among female participants and mental health and neurodevelopmental diagnoses were 
among the most commonly documented conditions. Higher STI rates (excluding PID) 
among female participants were associated with lower CD4 counts after adjusting for age. 
This finding has been previously reported, as well as the association of lower CD4 with 
herpes simplex virus reactivation and lack of human papilloma virus clearance.28–30,45–49 
These data suggest a potential biological effect of immunosuppression; additionally, more 
frequent risk behavior among patients incompletely adherent to cART may contribute to 
higher STI rates.8,30 Pregnancy rates overall (3.5/100PY) and at older ages (13–17 years: 
2.0/100PY and 18–30 years: 4.9/100PY) were similar to the general population (range for 
15–29 years: 3.95–16.30/100PY).50 Pregnancy rates were higher among those with lower 
CD4 counts, although the strength of this relationship decreased after age adjustment. 
Complications potentially related to long-term antiretroviral therapy, including anemia, 
pancreatitis, hepatitis, peripheral neuropathy, and metabolic and bone abnormalities, were 
documented infrequently, likely reflecting use of less toxic ARVs over time.35,51
Finally, our person-time results add a valuable dimension to the literature base of cross-
sectional and longitudinal studies on viremia in PHIVY. In the AMP and P1074 cohorts 
described here, 66% of person-time was spent with VL <400 copies/mL, similar to that 
observed in the HIV Research Network (63% of PHIVY aged 12–21 with VL <400 
copies/mL from 2009–2012). However, viral suppression is higher than reported in the 
Adolescent Trials Network (ATN, 37% of PHIVY with VL below the lower level of 
detection) and in a recent meta-analysis (pooled North America estimate of youth with 
suppressed VL: 53% (range: 28–75%) of youth aged 12–24 years from 1990–2013).4,8,52 
While lower suppression rates in the meta-analysis cohorts may reflect the inclusion of non-
perinatally HIV-infected youth, lower suppression rates for PHIVY in the ATN cohort may 
reflect older age in that cohort (17.9 years versus 14.6 years). In contrast to data from adults,

 we found that having VL ≥400 copies/mL while being prescribed cART did not improve 
immunosuppression compared to having VL ≥400 copies/mL while taking no ARVs at 
all.53–61 The 35% of person-time spent with VL ≥400 copies/mL in our study raises critical 
concerns not only for individual patient outcomes, but also for the HIV epidemic among US 
youth.30,35,62 Youth who are viremic despite being engaged in care are more likely to have 
resistant virus and to report lower condom use than non-viremic youth, and thus are at risk 
of secondary horizontal or vertical transmission.63–65
This analysis of PHIVY in two large cohort studies had several limitations. First, the 
smallest proportion of person-time (19%) was spent at ages 7–12; nevertheless, we had 
adequate power for all statistical comparisons. Next, data collection protocols in the two 
cohorts may have impacted incidence rate estimates for specific events: 1) because we 
analyzed first events, we could not identify “recurrent bacterial pneumonia,” potentially 
underestimating CDC-C events; 2) STI screening was not performed at study-specific 
intervals but per local care practice; 3) care sought by participants at non-study healthcare 
facilities was recorded only if reported to study staff. Additionally, P1074 recorded only 
events deemed “clinically significant” by healthcare providers, whereas AMP recorded all 
events; we addressed this limitation by including only events that met the reporting threshold 
for both studies (e.g. laboratory-value diagnoses were excluded). Furthermore, PHIVY least 
engaged in care and at highest risk for adverse outcomes may not have been included. 
Conversely, to permit consistent coding of events between the AMP and P1074 studies, we 
excluded events prior to baseline, which may have led to overestimation of some first event 
rates. Finally, adherence data were not included in the analysis, because adherence measures 
were collected only in one study (AMP). Despite these counterbalancing possibilities, this 
analysis provides the most recent, detailed data available about clinical risks in US PHIVY 
over time. This information will be critical information for US policy makers as research and 
programmatic funding shifts for pediatric HIV in the US.66
In summary, we find that serious clinical events, including OIs and death, are rare in PHIVY 
receiving suppressive ART, but viremia, lower CD4 counts, and rates of serious clinical 
events and mortality increase throughout adolescence and young adulthood. Interventions to 
improve ART adherence and optimize models of care as perinatally HIV-infected youth age 
are urgently needed to improve long-term outcomes among this growing and vulnerable 
population.

aProportion of person-time with CD4 count <200 cells/μL according to age: Relative difference (95% confidence interval): 13–17 vs. 7–12 years: 4% (2 – 5%); 18–21 vs. 7–12 years: 13% (10 – 16%); 22–
25 vs. 7–12 years: 24% (19 – 28%); 26–30 vs. 7–12 years: 22% (13 – 31%); p<0.001 for all comparisons.
bProportion of person-time with VL ≥400 copies/mL according to age: Relative difference (95% confidence interval): 13–17 vs. 7–12 years: 7% (3 – 11%); 18–21 vs. 7–12 years: 20% (15 – 24%); 22–25 
vs. 7–12 years: 24% (18 – 30%); 26–30 vs. 7–12 years: 15% (5 – 25%); p<0.01 for all comparisons. The median frequency of HIV RNA measurements during follow-up for subjects while aged 7–12, 13–
17, 18–21, 22–25, and 26–30 years was every 3.6, 3.5, 3.9, 4.3, and 4.3 months, respectively.
cProportion of person-time with CD4 count <200 cells/μL according to VL/ARV status: Relative difference (95% confidence interval): suppressive ARVs vs. no ARVs: −22% (−28 – −17%), p<0.001, non-
suppressive cART vs. no ARVs: 1% (−5 – 7%), p=0.72. (Similar results were seen for the outcome of CD4 count <500/μL.)
