Background-—Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Biopsychosocial
factors associated with PTSD likely account for some or all of this association. We determined whether 1, or a combination of
comorbid conditions explained the association between PTSD and incident CVD.
Methods and Results-—Eligible patients used 1 of 5 Veterans Health Affairs medical centers distributed across the United States.
Data were obtained from electronic health records. At index date, 2519 Veterans Health Affairs (VA) patients, 30 to 70 years of
age, had PTSD diagnoses and 1659 did not. Patients had no CVD diagnoses for 12 months before index date. Patients could enter
the cohort between 2008 and 2012 with follow-up until 2015. Age-adjusted Cox proportional hazard models were computed before
and after adjusting for comorbidities. Patients were middle aged (mean=50.1 years, SD�11.0), mostly male (87.0%), and 60% were
white. The age-adjusted association between PTSD and incident CVD was significant (hazard ratio=1.41; 95% CI: 1.21–1.63). After
adjustment for metabolic conditions, the association between PTSD and incident CVD was attenuated but remained significant
(hazard ratio=1.23; 95% CI: 1.06–1.44). After additional adjustment for smoking, sleep disorder, substance use disorder, anxiety
disorders, and depression, PTSD was not associated with incident CVD (hazard ratio=0.96; 95% CI: 0.81–1.15).
Conclusions-—PTSD is not an independent risk factor for CVD. Physical and psychiatric conditions and smoking that co-occur with
PTSD explain why this patient population has an increased risk of CVD. Careful monitoring may limit exposure to CVD risk factors
and subsequent incident CVD. (J Am Heart Assoc. 2019;8:e011133. DOI: 10.1161/JAHA.118.011133)

N
umerous research studies have shown that posttrau-
matic stress disorder (PTSD) is a risk factor for incident
cardiovascular disease (CVD),1–9 but it is possible that much
of this risk is attributable to the higher prevalence of
comorbid CVD risk factors in patients with versus without
PTSD. Several well-designed studies provide evidence that
the association between PTSD and CVD is attenuated but
remains significant after controlling for most traditional
CVD risk factors such as smoking, hypertension, and
diabetes mellitus.4,6,7,9–11 This extant work has not been
presented in the context of the change in the magnitude of
the association between PTSD and CVD associated with
both individual covariates and blocks of covariates nor has
it been determined whether PTSD is associated with
incident CVD in patients without comorbid CVD risk
factors.
PTSD is associated with a range of biological, psycholog-
ical, and behavioral correlates that could mediate the
association between PTSD and CVD.12,13 PTSD can result in
hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis dysfunction, increased
inflammation,

 other anxiety disorders are frequently comorbid with PTSD,
and depression and some anxiety disorders have been
identified as CVD risk factors.9,15,16
Existing studies of PTSD and incident CVD have not focused
on determining which physical, psychiatric, or behavioral
factors, either alone or in combination, partly or completely
explain the association between PTSD and CVD. For example,
recent research has demonstrated that nonobese patients
with PTSD have the same risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus
(T2DM) as the general population, which indicates the same
prevention goals, such as weight management, should reduce
the risk of incident T2DM in patients with and without PTSD.17
To elucidate reasons why patients with PTSD have a higher
CVD risk, the present study determined whether 1, or a
combination of multiple CVD risk factors common in those
with PTSD partly or completely explain the association
between PTSD and incident CVD.
Methods
The data that support the findings of this study are available
from the corresponding author upon reasonable request, and
appropriate Veterans Administration IRB and data use agree-
ment approvals.
Veterans Health Affairs (VHA) electronic medical record
data were obtained from 11 856 patients 18 to 70 years of
age (5940 with PTSD and 5916 without PTSD). Electronic
medical record data included International Classification of
Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) diagnosis codes, vital signs,
laboratory results, medications, demographic data, and type
of clinic encounter (eg, primary care, mental health clinic,
PTSD psychotherapy, etc.).
Eligibility
Patients with and without PTSD diagnoses were eligible if they
had 2 or more visits to 1 of 5 VHA medical centers between
fiscal year 2008 to 2012. Because patients <30 years of age
have a very low risk of CVD, we restricted the eligible cohort
to those 30 to 70 years of age. Patients with PTSD were
sampled from 5 VHA clinics distributed across the United
States (San Francisco, CA, San Diego, CA, Cincinnati, OH, and
Charleston, SC) if they had at least 2 visits to each medical
center’s PTSD specialty health clinic. Controls were randomly
sampled from the same medical centers. The observation
period continued until September 30, 2015 to allow all
patients at least 3 years of follow-up time (eg, for patients
entering the cohort in September 2012), which was sufficient
to detect incident CVD.
For patients with PTSD, the index date was the second visit
with a PTSD diagnosis (or inpatient discharge date), and for
non-PTSD patients the index date was their second visit at 1
of the 5 VHA medical centers. Because duration of PTSD may
confound our analysis and to remove prevalent CVD, we
included patients who were new PTSD cases by requiring a 1-
year “washout” before the index date in which patients with
prevalent PTSD and CVD were excluded. All patients were 18
to 70 years of age at index date. We selected the 2959
patients without PTSD diagnosis and 4075 patients with PTSD
diagnosis whose index date occurred in fiscal year 2009 to
fiscal year 2012. To allow for a biologically plausible
relationship between PTSD and incident CVD, we required
patients to have >90 days of follow-up after the index date.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria resulted in an analytic sample
of 4178 patients, of whom 1659 patients had no PTSD
diagnosis and 2519 patients had a PTSD diagnosis. The
cohort sampling process is shown in Figure.
Variable definitions
Primary exposure
We required 2 separate visits with an ICD-9 code for PTSD
(ICD-9: 309.81) within a 12-month period or 1 inpatient stay
to classify patients as having PTSD. This algorithm results in
positive predictive value = 82%, compared with a standard
cutoff for diagnosis on the PTSD Checklist (PCL) score ≥50.18
This algorithm has 79.4% agreement with lifetime PTSD
diagnoses measured by the Structured Clinical Interview for
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth
Edition).19 Patients without PTSD were free of an ICD-9 code
for PTSD in fiscal year 2008 to fiscal year 2012.
In a subset of patients with PCL scores (n=1981), we
selected the score closest to and before incident CVD to
compute the association between severity of PTSD and
incident CVD. PCL scores of 5020 and 6021 have been
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a risk factor for
cardiovascular disease (CVD).
• While no single comorbidity accounts for this association, a
combination of physical and psychiatric disorders and
smoking, all more prevalent in patients with PTSD, explains
the association between PTSD and incident CVD.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• Longer duration of exposure to CVD risk factors (eg,
smoking) among patients with PTSD may increase risk of
CVD.
• Early detection and effective management of hypertension,
type 2 diabetes mellitus, depression, anxiety, sleep disor-
ders, and other CVD risk factors may be particularly
important in mitigating risk of CVD in patients with PTSD.

 suggested as valid indicators of current PTSD. Because PCL
scores were available on a subset of patients, scores were not
included in adjusted Cox proportional hazard models.
Outcome
Incident CVD was defined by ICD-9 codes and Current
Procedural Terminology codes for cardiovascular revascular-
ization procedures. When available we followed definitions
validated in VHA patient data,22,23 and methods applied in
other administrative data.24,25 Detailed definitions are pro-
vided in Table 1.
Covariates
All variable definitions are shown in Table 1. We required 2 or
more visits with the same ICD-9 code in the same 12 months
or 1 inpatient visit to define mental health conditions because
this algorithm improves validity.18,26 Covariates were mea-
sured between 2008 and end of follow-up, (ie, incident CVD or
last available encounter).
Metabolic conditions included T2DM, obesity (body mass
index used for descriptive analysis), hypertension, and
hyperlipidemia. Psychiatric comorbidities included depres-
sion, any non-PTSD anxiety disorder, and any substance
abuse/dependence (SUD), which included alcohol or any drug
abuse/dependence diagnoses. Smoking status was obtained
from ICD-9 code for nicotine dependence and routine VA
health screening questionnaires and categorized into never,
former, and current smoker. Last, we adjusted for sleep
disorders associated with PTSD that may also increase risk of
CVD. Demographic variables included age, sex, race (white,

 black, “other”), marital status, access to health insurance
other than VHA, and volume of primary care utilization. The
latter 2 variables are used to control for detection bias.17,27,28
Analytic approach
Analyses were performed with SAS v9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary,
NC) at an alpha level of 0.05. With the exception of smoking
status and demographic variables, all covariates were mod-
eled as time dependent, which means patients can contribute
time to both exposed and nonexposed status. For example, a
patient contributes to nonhypertension status until a diagno-
sis of hypertension.
Bivariate analyses estimated the association between
covariates and PTSD using v2 tests for categorical variables
or independent samples t tests for continuous variables.
Unadjusted and adjusted Cox proportional hazard models
were computed to obtain hazard ratios (HR) and 95% CI.
Bivariate, unadjusted models assessed the crude association
of PTSD and each covariate with CVD. Adjusted Cox
proportional hazard models for the relationship of PTSD and
CVD were expanded by first including age, then adding
physical comorbidities, then psychiatric disorders, SUD, sleep
disorders, and smoking and last adding demographics.
Individual variables were added to separate Cox proportional
hazard models to determine the effect of each physical,
psychiatric, and behavioral covariate on the age-adjusted
association between PTSD and incident CVD. Follow-up time
was measured as days since index date to study end date,
which was the date of CVD diagnosis or last clinic encounter
for those who did not develop CVD. The proportional hazard
assumption was tested by examining a time-dependent
interaction term of PTSD and log (follow-up time), where a
significant (P<0.05) test indicates assumption violation and
different hazard trends over time.
Secondary outcome
Separate age-adjusted and fully adjusted Cox proportional
hazard models were computed to measure the association
between PTSD and risk for all-cause mortality.
Post hoc sensitivity analysis
We stratified analysis on the block of variables that explained
the association between PTSD and incident CVD by compar-
ing the association between PTSD and CVD in patients with
none versus 1 or more explanatory variable(s).
Subgroup analysis
Because age, sex, and race are associated with PTSD and risk
of CVD, we modeled interaction terms for PTSD by age, sex,
and race. Stratified Cox proportional hazard models were
computed for significant interactions.
This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board
of participating institutions with a waiver of informed consent.
Results
The cohort characteristics and distribution of covariates by
PTSD are shown in Table 2 as well as the median follow-up
time and CVD incidence rates. Overall, patients were middle
aged (mean = 50.1 years, SD, �11.0), mostly male (87.0%),
�60% were white, and about half were married. PTSD was
associated with an age-adjusted CVD incidence rate of 46.7/
1000 person years (PY), which was significantly (P<0.0001)

 greater than that observed in patients without PTSD (33.3/
1000 PY).
The mean PCL closest to and before CVD was 57.2
(SD�15.7). Younger patients were more likely to have PTSD
(P<0.0001). White race was less common and black race was
more common among patients with PTSD (P<0.0001).
Patients with only VHA health insurance were less prevalent
among those with PTSD (P<0.0001) and high healthcare users
were more prevalent among those with PTSD versus without
PTSD (P<0.0001).
Depression, other anxiety disorder, sleep disorders, and
SUD were each significantly more common among patients
with versus without PTSD (P<0.0001). Similarly, T2DM,
obesity, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia were significantly
more prevalent among patients with PTSD compared with
those without PTSD (P<0.0001). Significantly higher average
body mass index was observed in patients with PTSD
(P<0.0001), and the percent of patients with a body mass
index ≥30 was significantly higher in those with versus
without PTSD (P<0.0001). Current smokers were significantly
more prevalent in patients with PTSD compared with those
without PTSD (P<0.0001).
During follow-up, 782 patients developed CVD. Of these
cases, 10.5% were incident hypertensive heart disease
diagnoses, 6.8% myocardial infarction, 29.8% ischemic heart
disease, 4.2% diseases of pulmonary circulation, and 56.0%
“other” heart disease diagnoses. These were not mutually
exclusive and 6.4% had multiple components of incident CVD.
Results of unadjusted, bivariate Cox proportional hazard
models are shown in Table 3. In an unadjusted model, PTSD was
significantly (P=0.003) associated with increased risk of CVD
(HR=1.25; 95% CI: 1.08–1.45);however,higherversus lower PCL
scores closest to and before incident CVD were not significantly
associated with incident CVD. Age, male sex, and high primary
care health services use were all significantly and positively
associated with incident CVD. All psychiatric and physical
comorbiditiesweresignificantlyassociatedwithincreasedriskof
CVD. Both current and former smokers were significantly more
likely to develop CVD compared with never smokers.
Results from age-adjusted Cox proportional hazard models
are shown in Table 4. After adjusting for age, PTSD was
significantly
(P<0.0001)
associated
with
incident
CVD
(HR=1.41; 95% CI: 1.21–1.63). PTSD remained significantly
(P<0.007) associated with incident CVD after adjusting for
physical conditions in model 2; however, there was a 44%
reductionin the magnitude of theassociation (HR=1.23; 95% CI:
1.06–1.44). As shown in model 3, PTSD was no longer
associated with incident CVD after additional adjustment for
smoking, SUD, sleep disorders, other anxiety disorders, and
depression diagnoses (HR=0.96; 95% CI: 0.81–1.15). Results
from model 3 remained largely unchanged after adding
demographic variables.
The age-adjusted incidence rate per 1000 PY for all-cause
mortality did not significantly differ between patients with and
without PTSD (8.3/1000 PY versus 6.9/1000 PY; P=0.198).
As shown in Table 5, PTSD was not associated with all-cause
mortality in fully adjusted survival models (HR=0.83; 95% CI:
0.59–1.28).

 PTSD remained significantly associated with incident CVD
in each survival model that adjusted for individual comorbid
conditions (Table 6). Adjusting for T2DM alone, obesity
alone, and hyperlipidemia alone had a modest attenuating
effect on the association between PTSD and incident CVD;
however, adjusting for hypertension reduced the strength of
association by 32% (HR=1.28; 95% CI: 1.10–1.49). Individual
adjustment for SUD, sleep disorder, and depression also
substantially attenuated the association. Adjusting for SUD
reduced the magnitude of the association between PTSD and
incident CVD by 32%, sleep disorder reduced the association
by 40%, and depression reduced the association by 51%.
Adjusting for sex, race, marital status, and access to only
VHA insurance has little effect on association between PTSD
and CVD. However, controlling higher volume of healthcare
use reduced the association by 51%.
Results of survival models stratified on patients having
none versus 1 or more of the following conditions: depression,
anxiety disorder, substance use disorder, sleep disorder, or
current smoking (versus past/never) are shown in Table 7.
The prevalence of 1 or more of these conditions among
patients with PTSD was significantly greater than those
without PTSD (95.2% versus 61.8%, P<0.0001). Having 1 or
more of these conditions was slightly greater among those
with incident CVD versus those who did not develop CVD
(85.4% versus 81.1%, P=0.005).
Among patients without depression, anxiety disorders,
SUD, sleep disorder, and current smoking, PTSD was not
significantly associated with incident CVD in age-adjusted and
fully adjusted models. In both patients with 1 or more of these
comorbidities, PTSD was significantly associated with incident
CVD in age-adjusted models but not significantly associated
with incident CVD in fully adjusted models. However, the
stratum-specific HR were not significantly different.
There was no significant interaction of PTSD by sex or by
race on risk of CVD (Table 8). We observed a significant
(P=0.029) interaction of PTSD by age group (30–39, 40–49,
50–59, and 60–70 years of age). Fully adjusted Cox propor-
tional hazard models computed for each age group indicated
the magnitude of association between PTSD and incident CVD
was largest for 50- to 59-year-olds (HR=1.36; 95% CI: 0.96–
1.92). PTSD was not significantly associated with incident

 CVD among patients 30 to 39 years of age (HR=0.87; 95% CI:
0.47–1.61) and 40 to 49 years of age (HR=0.68; 95% CI:
0.45–1.04). Among patients 60 to 70 years of age, patients
with PTSD were significantly less likely to develop CVD
compared with those without PTSD (HR=0.74; 95% CI: 0.56–
0.98).
In all models, the proportional hazard assumption was met.
Discussion
In a large sample of VHA patients, we observed that patients
diagnosed with PTSD from September 30, 2008 to October 1,
2012, and followed up through 2015, were 41% more likely
than those without PTSD to develop CVD. Physical comor-
bidities partially explained this association. After adjusting for
these conditions, the magnitude of the association between
PTSD and incident CVD was reduced by 44% but remained
statistically significant (HR=1.23; 95% CI: 1.06–1.44). PTSD
was not associated with incident CVD after controlling for a
combination of physical, psychiatric, and behavioral condi-
tions (HR=0.96; 95% CI: 0.81–1.15). In a subsample of
patients without smoking, sleep disorders, anxiety disorders,
and depression, PTSD was not associated with CVD. However,
PTSD remained significantly associated with CVD after
adjusting for age and each individual covariate, which
suggests there is no single comorbidity or behavior that
explains this association. Instead, a combination of comorbid
conditions that are more prevalent in patients with versus
without PTSD appears to explain the association between
PTSD and incident CVD. This is consistent with the model of
PTSD and health outcomes proposed by Schnurr and
Green,12,13 which emphasizes multiple biological, psycholog-
ical, and behavioral correlates as mechanisms thorough which
PTSD leads to poor health. Lastly, allostatic load has been
proposed as a mechanism through which multiple risk factors,
even those not present at clinically significant levels, could
lead to disease.12,13,29
Existing studies differ in the selection or availability of
covariates adjusted for when measuring the association
between PTSD and incident CVD. Thus, it is difficult to make
direct comparisons of our findings with several large studies
of PTSD and incident CVD. Analysis of the Nurses’ Health
Study data indicated the magnitude of the association
between PTSD and incident cardiovascular events was
reduced by >50% after adjusting for hypertension, T2DM,
hormone therapy, and antidepressant use.5 In contrast, in the
Veterans Affairs Normative Aging Study, very little change in
the association between PTSD and CVD was observed after
controlling for smoking, blood pressure, cholesterol, body
mass index, self-reported family history of CVD, education,
depression, and alcohol consumption.7 There was little

PTSD and Incident Cardiovascular Disease

 change in the magnitude of association between severe PTSD
compared with no PTSD symptoms and incident CVD over a
14-year follow-up of the Baltimore cohort from the Epidemi-
ologic Catchment Area study.6
While our study adjusted for a similar set of variables as
prior publications did, we modeled them as time dependent,
which could allow the confounder to have a stronger effect on
the PTSD-incident CVD association. Though speculative, it is
possible that longer duration of exposure to comorbid
conditions, not just the lifetime presence of comorbid
diagnoses, is the reason we observed no significant associ-
ation between PTSD and incident CVD in multivariate models.
We found some evidence that PTSD was most strongly
associated with incident CVD among patients 50 to 59 years
of age. This is logical given the lower risk of CVD in patients
<50 years of age, and the increasing risk of CVD in older
patients may limit detecting a contribution from PTSD.
Limitations
We did not have data about family history of CVD; however,
others have reported that family history is not a confounder
because it is unrelated to PTSD diagnosis2 and Sumner et al5
reported no change in HR after controlling for family history of
myocardial infarction or stroke. Our results may not generalize
to patients older than 70 years of age. Patients had follow-up
time ranging from 3 to 8 years, which is not sufficient for
measuring lifetime CVD risk. About 75% of our sample was
<60 years of age; therefore, our study may represent the
association between PTSD and risk of early-onset CVD.
Findings may not generalize to nonveteran patient populations.
Misclassification is always possible in retrospective cohort
studies. If we misclassified patients with undiagnosed PTSD as
noncases, this would result in underestimating the association
between PTSD and CVD. We did not use propensity score
matching or weighting to control for confounding by demo-
graphic variables. However, our experience using both
propensity score matching and weighting indicates results
are most often replicated with traditional multivariate adjust-
ment. We did not adjust for multiple testing; however, all
hypotheses tests were planned.
Conclusions
Our
findings
suggest
that
exposure
to
smoking,
and
physical and psychiatric disorders explain the increased
risk
of
CVD
in
patients
with
PTSD.
Because
these
conditions are more common in patients with PTSD, closer
monitoring
for
comorbidities
may
be
warranted.
Early
detection
and
effective
management
may
reduce
the
burden of CVD associated with PTSD. Additionally, PTSD
itself can be effectively treated and further research is
needed to determine whether PTSD remission is associated
with fewer comorbidities and lower CVD risk. Recognizing
that PTSD does not preordain CVD may empower patients
to seek care to prevent and/or manage CVD risk factors.
Patients without PTSD are also at risk of CVD if they
smoke, have a sleep disorder, depression, or metabolic
disease. In both patient populations, the risk of CVD can be
mitigated with health behavior change and effective chronic
disease management.
