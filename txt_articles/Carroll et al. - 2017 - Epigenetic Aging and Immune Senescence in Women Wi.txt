Abstract
BACKGROUND—Insomnia symptoms are associated with vulnerability to age-related morbidity 
and mortality. Cross-sectional data suggest accelerated biological aging may be a mechanism 
through which sleep influences risk. A novel method for determining age acceleration using 
epigenetic methylation to DNA has demonstrated predictive utility as an epigenetic clock and 
prognostic of age-related morbidity and mortality.

 METHODS—We examined the association of epigenetic age and immune cell aging with sleep in 
the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) study (N=2,078; Age M(SD)=64.5(7.1) with assessment of 
insomnia symptoms (restlessness, difficulty falling asleep, waking at night, trouble getting back to 
sleep, and early awakenings), sleep duration (short-sleep 5 or less; long-sleep >8hrs), epigenetic 
age, naïve T cell (CD8+CD45RA+CCR7+), and late differentiated T cells (CD8+CD28−CD45RA
−).
RESULTS—Insomnia symptoms were related to advanced epigenetic age, B(SE)=1.02(.37), 
P=0.005, after adjustments for covariates. Insomnia symptoms were also associated with more late 
differentiated T cells (B(SE)=.59(.21), P=.006), but not with naïve T cells. Self-reported short and 
long sleep duration were unrelated to epigenetic age. Short sleep, but not long sleep, was 
associated with fewer naïve T cells (P<.005) and neither were related to late differentiated T cells.
CONCLUSIONS—Symptoms of insomnia were associated with increased epigenetic age of 
blood tissue, and were associated with higher counts of late differentiated CD8+ T cells. Short 
sleep was unrelated to epigenetic age and late differentiated cell counts, but was related to a 
decline in naïve T cells. In this large population based study of women in the United States, 
insomnia symptoms are implicated in accelerated aging.

INTRODUCTION
Insomnia symptoms are associated with increased vulnerability to physical and mental 
declines, increased frailty in the elderly, elevated inflammation, and age related morbidity 
and mortality (1–9) including risk for coronary heart disease(10). Sleep duration has also 
been linked to increased risk for disease and death in a U-shaped fashion, such that both 
short sleepers and long sleepers are at elevated risk(11;12). Thus both sleep duration and 
insomnia symptoms may have lasting health implications.
Cross-sectional epidemiological data have linked short sleep duration, poor sleep quality, 
and insomnia to shorter leukocyte telomere length(LTL), a proposed marker of biological 
aging(13–18), suggesting that inadequate quantity and quality of sleep may accelerate 
biological aging and be a potential mechanism through which sleep influences disease risk. 
Even though shortened LTL predicts age-related disease risk, including cancer 
incidence(19), cardiovascular disease(20;21), and mortality(22–24), LTL is thought to be an 
incomplete measure of biological aging(25).
An alternative biomarker of aging has recently been developed and is based on DNA 
methylation (DNAm), referred to as the “epigenetic clock”(26–28). This epigenetic clock 
method for estimating age is highly correlated with chronological age across cell types and 
complex tissues(26;29;30). The epigenetic clock is thought to capture aspects of biological 
age, supported by data demonstrating that the older epigenetic age of blood is predictive of 
all-cause mortality(31;32), younger epigenetic age relates to cognitive and physical fitness in 
the elderly(33), and epigenetic age is younger in the offspring of Italian semi-

 supercentenarians (i.e. subjects aged 105 or older) compared to age-matched controls(34). 
The epigenetic clock method has been used in applications surrounding obesity(29), Down 
syndrome(35), HIV infection(36), Parkinson’s disease(37), Alzheimer’s disease related 
neuropathologies(38), and lung cancer(39). Estimates are that 40% of epigenetic age 
acceleration is inheritable(26;33), with the remaining 60% thought to be accounted for by 
unidentified environmental and behavioral contributions. Along this line, initial work has 
begun to examine the role of environmental factors that may contribute to accelerated aging, 
with evidence that accelerated epigenetic aging is associate with lifetime stress(40), low 
socioeconomic status, and psychological trauma(41; 42). However, it is not yet known 
whether epigenetic age acceleration, using the DNAm based biomarker of aging, relates to 
measures of sleep disturbances or sleep duration.
We hypothesized that insomnia symptoms and sleep duration would be associated with 
epigenetic age acceleration among women from the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) study. 
Consistent with findings that symptoms of insomnia increase inflammation(1) and morbidity 
and mortality risk(7–9; 11; 43), we predicted that greater insomnia symptoms would be 
associated with an older epigenetic age. Similar to findings of sleep duration with 
mortality(44), we also predicted that both short and long sleep duration would be associated 
with greater epigenetic aging.
METHODS
Participants
Participants included women in the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) study, with detailed 
methods previously published(45–47). Exclusion criterion for the observational study was 
minimal to assure generalizability. Women were eligible to participate if they were ages 50–
79, postmenopausal, willing to provide written informed consent, and resided in a nearby 
area within proximity of 40 WHI clinical centers across the United States for 3+ years after 
enrollment. Recruitment for the baseline assessment occurred from 1993–1999. The current 
analyses include a subset of 2,078 participants who were selected for an integrative 
genomics study with the aim to identify genomic determinants of coronary heart disease, as 
reported previously(39). Included in the current study are individuals with both epigenetic 
and sleep data available at baseline.
DNA methylation profiling
Methylation analysis were performed at HudsonAlpha Institute of Biotechnology using the 
Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip, which includes 485,577 different CpG 
sites, and was described previously(39).
Estimating blood cell counts
We estimate blood cell proportions using the advanced analysis option of the epigenetic 
clock software(26) available online at (https://labs.genetics.ucla.edu/horvath/dnamage/), 
which estimates the percentage of late differentiated CD8+ T cells (CD8+CD28−CD45RA−) 
and the number (count) of naïve CD8+ T cells (CD8+CD45RA+CCR7+)(36). Final counts

 statistically adjusted for chronological age. Additional cell subsets reported in the 
supplement.
DNA Methylation Age and the Epigenetic Clock
We estimated the epigenetic age (also known as DNAm age) of each blood sample using two 
well defined methods. First, we measure extrinsic epigenetic age acceleration (EEAA) that is 
highly correlated with immune senescence. EEAA is based on the DNAm Age measure 
proposed in Hannum et al (2013)(28) that relies on 71 CpGs, and is enhanced by forming a 
weighted average of this with the estimated blood cell counts from three blood cell types 
that are known to change with age: naive (CD45RA+CCR7+) cytotoxic T cells and late 
differentiated (CD28−CD45RA−) cytotoxic T cells and plasma B cells using the approach of 
(48). The (static) weights that are used in the weighted average are determined by the 
correlation between the respective variables and chronological age in the WHI data (48). By 
definition, EEAA is positively correlated with the estimated abundance of exhausted CD8+ 
T cells, plasma B-cells, and is negatively correlated with naive CD8+ T cells. Therefore, the 
measures of EEAA tracks both age related changes in blood cell composition and intrinsic 
epigenetic changes.
The second approach uses the Horvath (2013) method, using 353 CpGs and coefficient 
values, as reported previously(26), to define DNAm age. This measure, which we call 
intrinsic epigenetic age acceleration (IEAA), rather than using blood cell types to form a 
weighted average (as EEAA does), adjusts for imputed measures of blood cell counts: naive 
cytotoxic T cells and late differentiated cytotoxic T cells and plasma B cells. Further detail 
of these methods and comparisons between EEAA and IEAA can be found in the 
supplement. Both the EEAA and IEAA measure are expressed as the deviation between 
DNAm age and chronological age, and are used to define measures of epigenetic age 
acceleration, which is computed from the residual when regressing DNAm age on 
chronological age. A positive value indicates that epigenetic age is higher than chronological 
age.
Measurement of Sleep
Sleep Duration—Subjective reports of sleep duration were obtained at the baseline visit, 
in which subjects reported how many hours of sleep they got on a typical night during the 
past 4 weeks. Response options included the following: 5 or less, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 or more 
hours. Consistent with research linking sleep duration with mortality risk(44), and consistent 
with the newly released joint consensus statement of the American Academy of Sleep 
Medicine and the Sleep Research Society on the recommended amount of sleep for healthy 
adults, we created dummy variables to categorize short sleepers as 5 or less (sensitivity 
analyses categorized as 6 or less given disagreement as to whether the risk for morbidity/
mortality is also elevated in this group), normal sleepers as 7–8 hours (the recommended 
amount of optimal sleep), and long sleepers as >8 hours (identified in the optimal dose of 
sleep model as elevated risk for disease)(49).
Global sleep disturbances—Subjective reports of sleep disturbances were derived from 
the Women’s Health Initiative Insomnia Rating Scale (WHIIRS)(50). Five items (0 to 4)

 from the scale are summed to produce an overall global sleep disturbances score ranging 
from 0 to 20, with higher scores reflecting greater sleep disturbance and predictive of 
CVD(10). Previous literature has used an elevated WHIIRS scores of >10 to indicate a 
significant sleep disturbance(51), which has reasonable specificity for identifying insomnia 
cases (50; 52).
Insomnia Symptoms—Whereas the WHIIRS reflects a global sleep disturbances 
assessment, the global score does not provide specificity and sensitivity for detecting 
discrete insomnia symptoms. Thus, we examined the five individual insomnia symptoms 
reported in the WHIIRS to create an insomnia symptoms specific measure, allowing us a 
more sensitive assessment of the relationship between insomnia symptoms and epigenetic 
age. Individuals were classified as having insomnia symptoms if they reported any one of 
the following occurring 1 to 2 or more times per week (and in sensitivity analyses occurring 
3 or more times a week): restlessness, difficulty falling asleep, difficulty waking during the 
night, early awakenings, and inability to fall back to sleep. We computed a sum score 
reflecting the number of insomnia symptoms reported (0 to 5) to estimate severity, and a 
yes/no score if reporting any insomnia symptom.
Snoring—Self-reported snoring was also included as a covariate in models to adjust for 
possible sleep apnea, given the predictive utility of this measure in WHI for CVD(53).
Depressive Symptoms—The Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale 
(CES-D)(54) 6-item version was administered to participants, as was reported previously(45; 
55), and is used to control for depressive symptoms.
Statistical Analysis
The measures of epigenetic age and cell counts include adjustment for chronological age 
(i.e., an estimate of accelerated aging), therefore further adjustment for chronological age in 
the models was not necessary. Cross-sectional associations of sleep measures with 
epigenetic age acceleration, naïve CD8+ cell counts, and late differentiated CD8+ cell 
counts were performed using bi-weight mid-correlation analyses. To test for differences in 
epigenetic age acceleration between sleep duration categories, sleep disturbances categories, 
and insomnia symptoms, we used a linear multivariate models. Model 1 adjusts for race/
ethnicity (Black/non-Black, Hispanic/non-Hispanic), education (less than high school, high 
school diploma, some college, Bachelor’s degree, graduate school), and BMI categories 
(<18.5, 18.5–24.9, 25–29.9, 30–34.9, 35–39.9, 40+) and tested differences in EEAA and 
IEAA between: 1) any WHIIRS insomnia symptoms (Yes/No), 2) sleep disturbances groups 
with normal quality sleepers (WHIRS 10 or less) as the reference, and 3) short duration 
sleepers, long duration sleepers, and normal duration sleepers (reference). In addition to 
adjusting for Model 1 covariates, Model 2 adjusts for comorbid chronic conditions including 
diabetes, hypertension, and CVD. Secondary analyses employed pairwise comparisons using 
the least significant difference (LSD) method to test differences in EEAA between number 
of WHIIRS insomnia symptoms categories (0, 1–2, 3–4, and 5 symptoms).

 Results
Descriptive statistics on demographic data and distribution of sleep measures can be seen in 
Table 1. Among the sample of 2,078 women, mean age was 64.5 years (SD=7.1), with 
variations in epigenetic age relative to chronological age (−27.6 to +27.9 years for EEAA; 
−21.5 to +42.7 years for IEAA. The WHI sample is racially and ethnically diverse with 
approximately half non-Hispanic white, a third Black, and the remainder of Hispanic 
ethnicity.
Insomnia Symptoms, Sleep Duration, and Epigenetic Age Acceleration
Initial unadjusted analyses of differences in EEAA between women with and without 
WHIIRS insomnia symptoms revealed a significant effect (See Table 2). Further adjustment 
in Model 1 for race/ethnicity, BMI, educational attainment, and snoring found that the linear 
coefficient for insomnia symptoms was significant (P=0.005; Table 4). Further adjustment 
for health conditions in Model 2 did not modify this effect (P=.02). A closer examination of 
whether the number of insomnia symptoms was related to EEAA suggested that greater 
difference in epigenetic age correlated with increasing number of WHIIRS insomnia 
symptoms (P=0.007; See Figure 1) such that the epigenetic age (EEAA) of women with no 
insomnia symptoms were “younger” than those with 1–2 symptoms (mean difference = 
1.17, P=0.002), 3–4 symptoms (mean difference = 1.10, P=0.01), and 5 symptoms (mean 
difference = 1.77, P=0.005). Further analyses adjusting for depressive symptoms did not 
modify these results. In addition, we performed sensitivity analyses to examine whether the 
effect was predominantly from those reporting insomnia symptoms 3 or more times per 
week, as opposed to 1 to 2 times per week. We found that individuals reporting any 
insomnia symptoms, either selected if occurring 3 or more times per week or 1–2 times per 
week or more, exhibited significantly older epigenetic age when compared to those with no 
insomnia symptoms (P’s<.05).
To characterize whether unique dimensions of insomnia were more strongly related to 
epigenetic age, we further analyzed the individual insomnia symptoms: trouble going to 
sleep, frequent waking at night, trouble getting back to sleep, waking earlier than planned, 
and restless sleep. Older epigenetic age (higher EEAA) was present in women who reported 
waking in the night compared to women with no night time awakenings, P=0.004. Model 2 
adjustments did not alter this effect, P=0.008. Women reporting waking at night were on 
average one year older epigenetically than those without night time awakenings. The other 
insomnia symptoms alone did not predict epigenetic age acceleration (See Table 4).
Examination of EEAA with the global WHIIRS sleep disturbance scores, cutoff >10, 
revealed differences in women with elevated WHIIRS scores (M=.573,n=399) compared to 
women with scores 10 or less (M=−.183, n=1,615), P<0.05. Linear effect Model 1 (See 
Table 4) adjusted for race/ethnicity, BMI, educational attainment, and snoring, and Model 2 
further adjusted for health conditions, with subsequent reduction in the strength of the effect 
of sleep disturbances, P=0.09 and P=0.08 respectively. Additional adjustment for depressive 
symptoms did not modify these results, P=0.10.

 Analyses examining differences in EEAA by short sleep and long sleep compared to normal 
sleep duration found no significant effects, P’s>0.10 (See Tables 2 and 4). Further sensitivity 
analyses tested whether categorization of short sleep as 6 hours per night or less would 
generate different findings. Sleeping 6 hrs or less compared to 7–8 hrs was unrelated to 
EEAA, P=.95. Given findings by Vgontzas and colleagues that demonstrate a significant 
increased risk for mortality among short sleepers with insomnia symptoms (8), further 
analyses examined the interaction of short sleep (6 or less; 5 or less) with insomnia 
symptoms. There were no significant interaction effects (P’s>.4). Analyses examining 
associations of sleep duration and disturbances with IEAA found no significant differences 
in relation to insomnia symptoms, nor extremes of sleep duration. See Supplemental Table 
S1 for model coefficients and P values.
Insomnia Symptoms, Sleep Duration, and Cell Subtypes: Naïve and Late Differentiated T 
Cells
Analyses of CD8+ naïve cell with sleep dimensions were performed. While WHIIRS 
insomnia symptoms were not associated with naïve CD8+ cells, short sleep and trouble 
falling asleep were significantly associated with fewer naïve CD8+ cells (P’s<0.05; See 
Table 3).
CD8+CD28−CD45− late differentiated T cells were significantly positively correlated with 
WHIIRS global sleep disturbance scores >10, trouble falling asleep, waking at night, trouble 
going back to sleep, and having any insomnia symptom (All P’s<0.05; See Table 3). The 
findings were such that having a high global sleep disturbance score, discrete insomnia 
symptoms, or any insomnia symptom was related to a greater amount of these late 
differentiated, exhausted T cells in circulating blood. Sleep duration was unrelated to the late 
differentiated T cell subtype (See Table 3).
In subsequent adjusted models, reporting any insomnia symptoms continued to be 
significantly associated with having more CD8+CD28−CD45RA− T cells, after adjustments 
for race/ethnicity, BMI, educational attainment, snoring, and health conditions, B(SE)=.59(.
21), P=0.006. Further adjustment for depressive symptoms had no effect on these results, 
P=0.008. Examination of each insomnia symptom, adjusting for model 1 and 2 covariates, 
revealed modest effects for trouble falling asleep, B(SE)=.32(.19), P=0.09, waking at night 
B(SE)=.40(.20), P=0.05, and going back to sleep, B(SE)=.34(.18), P=0.06. Linear effect 
models, adjusting for race/ethnicity, BMI, educational attainment, snoring, and health 
conditions demonstrated the significant associations of the WHIIRS measure of global sleep 
disturbances with CD8+CD28−CD45RA− was retained, B(SE)=.41(.21), P=0.05.
Discussion
Overall, we find modest correlations between self-reported insomnia symptoms and 
measures of epigenetic age acceleration in peripheral blood cells. Insomnia symptoms were 
significantly associated with the extrinsic measure of age acceleration, which measures the 
age of the immune system. Moreover, and consistent with the findings with extrinsic age 
acceleration, we report that insomnia symptoms were significantly associated with a greater 
proportion of late differentiated cytotoxic T cells (CD8+CD28−CD45RA−), indicative of an

 aged immune system(56). Insomnia symptoms did not seem to relate to intrinsic age 
acceleration, which is independent of age related changes in blood cell counts. More careful 
examination of insomnia symptoms revealed that the association with the extrinsic measure 
of epigenetic age was graded; increasing number of insomnia symptoms was associated with 
an older epigenetic age, in which those reporting 5 symptoms had the oldest epigenetic age 
compared to women with no insomnia symptoms (See Figure 1). This effect was present 
after adjustment for potential confounds including race/ethnicity, BMI, educational 
attainment, snoring, depressive symptoms, and health conditions. When we analyzed 
whether specific dimensions of insomnia symptoms uniquely related to epigenetic age 
acceleration, we found that self-reported waking at night was significantly related to an older 
epigenetic age, more so than other insomnia symptoms reported. In parallel to the findings 
with the number of insomnia symptoms, the global measure of sleep disturbances showed a 
more modest relationship with epigenetic age, suggesting use of the WHIIRS cutoff >10, 
which has high specificity for identifying insomnia cases, is a less sensitive measure than 
examination of the cumulative effect of individual insomnia symptoms in the context of age 
acceleration.
In addition, we found that late differentiated T cells, which are in a senescent or near 
senescent state, were higher in those reporting insomnia symptoms. This finding suggests 
poor sleep may accelerate CD8+ cell replication and progression to cellular senescence. This 
is in line with findings of Prather and colleagues(17), reporting marked telomere shortening 
in CD8+ T cells with sleep disturbances. Importantly, CD8+CD28− T cells have noticeably 
shorter telomere length and reduced telomerase activity, significantly impaired replicative 
capacity, and are at an increased proportion in circulation among those with increasing 
chronological age, individuals who are HIV+ (an accelerated aging disease)(36) and those 
with diseases and conditions of later life(56–58). Likewise, telomeric shortening within 
CD8+CD28− cells was predictive of susceptibility to a novel virus, further implicating this 
cell subset in cellular aging and immune compromise(59). Taken together, our results 
advocate that experiencing sleep disturbances is associated with accelerated aging, 
particularly within the immune system.
In contrast, our hypothesis that extremes of sleep duration would be related to an accelerated 
epigenetic age was not supported by the data. We found no significant effects of short or 
long sleep on extrinsic or intrinsic epigenetic age. There was a trend for a difference in 
intrinsic epigenetic age to be associated with short- as compared to normal sleep duration, 
although this did not reach statistical significance (Table 2a). We did see a significant inverse 
association of naïve T cell counts with short sleep duration (Table 2b), indicating a reduction 
in the number of naïve T cells in the T-cell compartment among those with short sleep. 
These findings have implications for early immune responses to novel antigens, such as 
susceptibility to a new cold or flu virus or in response to vaccinations(60), which in part 
contributes to reduced immune competence seen in late life. Indeed, recent evidence has 
linked short sleep with an increased risk for developing the common cold after exposure(61).
A lack of association of epigenetic age acceleration with extremes of sleep duration is 
contrasted to the considerable epidemiological data linking short and long sleep with 
morbidity and mortality outcomes(11;12). Our null results may be due to measurement error

 of sleep duration. Considerable differences exist between sleep duration obtained when 
assessed by objective measures such as actigraphy as compared to self-reports of sleep 
duration, as used in the current report. Indeed, the correlation between objective and 
subjective measures are r=.45, with average self-report being. 8 hrs more than objectively 
recorded sleep duration(62). Future research should address this question using an objective 
assessment of sleep duration over repeated samplings and not rely solely on retrospective 
self-report of sleep duration.
In contrast to self-reported sleep duration, self-reported insomnia symptoms using the 
WHIIRS has been demonstrated to have test-retest reliability and construct validity 
compared to objective indicators of sleep(52). Although objectively derived assessments of 
waking after sleep onset are likely to capture more nuanced information about frequency and 
length of waking, self-reports of waking during the night, waking early, or difficulty falling 
asleep are all subjective self-reports of insomnia symptoms and are considered valid 
methods in epidemiological studies.
These cross-sectional results need to be replicated in a prospective design to determine 
causation, but suggest that sleep disturbances may increase risk for morbidity and mortality 
by accelerating the rate at which the immune, and possibly other bodily systems, age. 
Should replication and prospective designs support these initial findings, then this raises the 
possibility that maintenance of sleep health (i.e., absence of sleep disturbance) slow the 
aging process and is vital for the prevention of early onset of disease and premature 
death(63). Alternatively, persistent insomnia symptoms may accelerate aging(64) by 
disrupting healthy cellular function, increasing energy demands, promoting DNA damage, 
inflammation, and cellular senescence(65–71), which may lead to early mortality(64). 
Together these biological alterations result in epigenetic modifications that appear with more 
advanced cellular age, which supports the hypothesis that DNAm age captures the 
cumulative work of the epigenomic maintenance system(29).
There are several limitations to the current findings. First, the results are limited by the 
cross-sectional design, and an observation of associations between variables does not 
provide evidence of causality. Future studies should explore the alternative hypothesis that 
older epigenetic age is a driver of disruptions in sleep. Disruptions in circadian patterns with 
age may be the consequence of biological aging of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the 
circadian clock of the body(72). Along this line, aging is associated with alterations in many 
aspects of the SCN that influence sleep timing, duration, rhythm, depth, and quality. 
Therefore the direction of this association cannot be determined in the present results. 
However, we did not find associations of sleep disturbances with IEAA (an indicator of 
more global aging), but rather primarily with EEAA, an indicator of immune system aging. 
Likewise, there are several potential unidentified confounds that might influence the data, 
including unmeasured subclinical disease. As mentioned previously, the current results are 
limited by self-report measures of sleep taken from one sampling time point, and may not be 
representative of long term sleep patterns, adding error to the measure. Future research 
should establish repeated assessments of objectively defined sleep characteristics as they 
relate to changes in biological aging over time. Likewise, although our findings point to a 
link between insomnia symptoms and epigenetic age, the effect sizes are small; further,

 caution should be taken when interpreting these cross-sectional results where directionality 
and causation is not tested. The current sample was comprised of women only, and is not 
representative of males in the population. Finally, we focused on blood tissue. Here we did 
see associations of insomnia symptoms with alterations in cell subsets representative of 
aging immunity including reductions in naïve cytotoxic T cells and increases in late 
differentiated/exhausted T cells. Future studies should explore whether sleep is associated 
with the epigenetic ages of other tissues outside of the immune system. Physiological factors 
appear to have tissue specific aging effects, e.g. obesity is strongly correlated with epigenetic 
age acceleration of liver tissue but much less so in blood(29).
Several strengths of the study design should also be noted, particularly the high quality of 
the WHI study design, measurements, and sample collection, and the diverse sampling of 
women across various strata of the United States of America. The study is well powered to 
test the hypotheses. The study also included a validated measure of sleep, the WHIIRS. 
Another notable strength is the highly accurate biomarkers of epigenetic age as mentioned in 
the introduction.
Conclusions
In summary, insomnia symptoms were significantly associated with a marker of epigenetic 
age acceleration in a sample of over two-thousand women from the WHI study, representing 
the first findings to date to document insomnia symptoms to be associated with the 
“epigenetic clock”. Given that sleep disturbances are also associated with increase 
vulnerability to physical and mental declines, and age related morbidity and mortality 
risk(2–10), these findings raise the possibility that accelerated epigenetic aging might serve 
as one of several mechanisms through which sleep disturbances influence risk for age 
related disease and early mortality. These findings are in concordance with work examining 
sleep disturbances, including insomnia(18), and blood cell telomere length(13;15–17), and 
extend the findings to link insomnia symptoms with accelerated epigenetic aging and 
evidence of an aged immune system. Given the recognized importance of aging biology for 
many chronic diseases seen in later life(73;74) and the growing demand to address the needs 
of an aging population, this work provides initial evidence that addressing behavioral factors 
such as sleep disturbances, which are prevalent in older adults(2), may promote an extension 
of healthspan, more years of healthy living without chronic disease in later life(74;75).

*Each independent predictor is entered in a separate model with EEAA as the dependent variable. Model 1 adjusts for race (Black vs. non-Black; 
Hispanic vs. non-Hispanic), education (category), BMI (category), and snore (yes=1). Model 2 adjusts for comorbid chronic conditions: diabetes, 
hypertension, and CVD.
