Objective. To identify an evidence-based minimum physical activity threshold to predict improved or sustained high
function for adults with lower-extremity joint symptoms.
Methods. Prospective multisite data from 1,629 adults, age ‡49 years with symptomatic lower-extremity joint pain/
aching/stiffness, participating in the Osteoarthritis Initiative accelerometer monitoring substudy were clinically
assessed 2 years apart. Improved/high function in 2-year gait speed and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) were based
on improving or remaining in the best (i.e., maintaining high) function quintile compared to baseline status. Optimal
thresholds predicting improved/high function were investigated using classification trees for the legacy federal guide-
line metric requiring 150 minutes/week of moderate-vigorous (MV) activity in bouts lasting 10 minutes or more (MV-
bout) and other metrics (total MV, sedentary, light intensity activity, nonsedentary minutes/week).
Results. Optimal thresholds based on total MV minutes/week predicted improved/high function outcomes more
strongly than the legacy or other investigated metrics. Meeting the 45 total MV minutes/week threshold had increased
relative risk (RR) for improved/high function (gait speed RR 1.8, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.6, 2.1 and PRO
physical function RR 1.4, 95% CI 1.3, 1.6) compared to less active adults. Thresholds were consistent across sex, body
mass index, knee osteoarthritis status, and age.
Conclusion. These results supported a physical activity minimum threshold of 45 total MV minutes/week to promote
improved or sustained high function for adults with lower-extremity joint symptoms. This evidence-based threshold is
less rigorous than federal guidelines (‡150 MV-bout minutes/week) and provides an intermediate goal towards the
federal guideline for adults with lower-extremity symptoms.
INTRODUCTION
Physical activity is endorsed as a healthy lifestyle strategy.
Federal guidelines for adults stipulate a minimum thresh-
old of 150 minutes/week of moderate intensity, or 75
minutes of vigorous-intensity physical activity or an
equivalent combination (1). These guidelines utilize a leg-
acy metric requiring activity bouts of moderate or vigorous
activity lasting at least 10 minutes, based on studies dem-
onstrating cardiovascular benefits from aerobic activity
(2–5). However, the vast majority of adults fail to meet
these guidelines (6,7). Even more concerning is that as

 many as 2 in 5 adults with lower-extremity joint condi-
tions not only fail to meet guidelines, they register zero on
the legacy bout metric; over an entire week they do not
have a single session of moderate physical activity lasting
10 minutes (8,9).
Maintaining function is crucial to independent commu-
nity living for adults with physical impairments. For
many adults living with joint conditions, improving or
maintaining high function may be as great a concern as
cardiovascular health. Physical function has long been
recognized as a proxy for overall health. Physical function
assessed by gait speed reflects functional status and health
(10). Gait speed has been repeatedly associated with sur-
vival in epidemiologic studies (11–13). Similarly, patient-
reported functional status is related to quality of life and
life expectancy (14). Lower-extremity joint conditions
such as hip or knee osteoarthritis (OA) increase a person’s
risk for subsequent loss of function (12,15). While being
physically active is associated with functional gains (16)
among adults with joint disease (17), it is not known if
there is a level of physical activity that may promote better
function or maintain high functional ability (18).
Investigating what physical activity levels might improve
low function or maintain high (improved/high) function
among adults with lower-extremity symptoms motivates 2
questions: 1) Are there alternative physical activity metrics
that better predict improved/high function than the legacy
bout–based metric, which registers zero for a large portion
of these adults? and 2) What minimum threshold of physi-
cal activity best predicts improved/high function? The
objective of this study is to identify optimal physical activ-
ity metrics and dosage thresholds related to improving low
function or maintaining high function among adults with
lower-extremity joint symptoms.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study population. Participants were a subcohort of the
Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) enrolled into an accelerome-
ter ancillary study conducted at the OAI 2008–2010 clinic
visit (OAI 4-year followup), which is baseline for this
study. The OAI is a multicenter prospective study investi-
gating risk factors and biomarkers for the progression
and/or onset of knee OA (see http://www.oai.ucsf.edu/
datarelease/About.asp). At enrollment, the OAI recruited
4,796 men and women between ages 45 and 79 years from
4 clinical sites: Baltimore, Maryland; Pittsburg, Pennsylva-
nia; Pawtucket, Rhode Island; and Columbus, Ohio. The
OAI enrolled participants with or at high risk for develop-
ing symptomatic, radiographic knee OA. High risk was
defined as frequent knee symptoms without radiographic
OA, or 2 or more eligibility risk factors (e.g., age, high body
mass index [BMI], prior knee injury, knee surgery, family
history of total knee replacement for OA, Heberden’s
nodes, and repetitive knee bending) (19). OAI eligibility cri-
teria
have
been
described
in
detail
elsewhere
(20).
Approval was obtained from the institutional review board
at each OAI site and at Northwestern University. Each par-
ticipant provided written informed consent.
A subgroup of 2,127 OAI participants participated in
an accelerometer study at the 48-month clinic visit,
which represents our study’s baseline. Eligibility for the
substudy
required
a
scheduled
OAI
followup
visit
between August 2008 and June 2010. The present study
sample included 1,919 accelerometer study participants
reporting ankle, foot, knee, and/or hip lower-extremity
joint symptoms of pain, aching, or stiffness. Ankle, foot,
and knee questions solicited symptoms over the past 30
days; hip questions solicited symptoms over the past 12
months. Of individuals reporting hip symptoms, 90%
were in the analysis sample based on symptoms reported
in another joint. Loss to followup was minimal; over
96% of this cohort (1,845 of 1,919) participated in a
followup visit 2 years later. For analysis purposes, we
restricted our sample to 1,647 individuals with baseline
and 2-year followup (2010–2012) physical function mea-
sured objectively by gait speed (n 5 1,476) and/or by
patient-reported outcome (PRO) based on the 12-item
Short Form (SF-12) health survey physical component
score (n 5 1,629), respectively (Figure 1). Excluded were
173 persons with inadequate accelerometer monitoring to
support reliable physical activity estimates (7) (i.e., less
than 4 valid days of monitoring based on daily evidence of
$10 hours of accelerometer wear), and 89 participants did
not have 2-year followup outcomes (64 with no contact, 23
with only phone contact, and 2 refused).
Outcomes. The
primary
outcome
was
change
in
improved or high (improved/high) physical function sta-
tus between baseline and 2-year followup, separately
assessed by objective gait speed and by the PRO physical
function SF-12 physical component score. Improved/high
function was based on transitions across functional
quintiles over time. This method captures practical, mean-
ingful changes in function over time in OA populations
(21–23). Five quintile groups are defined from the full par-
ent enrollment OAI knee OA cohort for objective gait
speed physical function (Q1: ,3.7, Q2: 3.7–4.0, Q3: 4.1–
4.3, Q4: 4.4–4.7, and Q5: $4.8 feet per second) and PRO
physical function (Q1: ,39.4, Q2: 39.4–46.9, Q3: 47.0–
52.1, Q4: 52.2–56.0, and Q5: $56.1). Baseline and 2-year
function scores from accelerometer substudy participants
(n 5 1,647) were categorized into each of these groups.
Subsequent
improved/high
function
was
defined
by
maintaining function in the best group (i.e., Q5 at both
evaluations) or moving into a better group (i.e., moving

 from Q1–Q4 to a higher group) at 24 months compared
to baseline. We used function transitions to identify
improved/high physical function outcomes rather than an
improvement exceeding a minimum clinically important
difference (MCID) due to 1) the value of retaining partici-
pants who maintain high function (e.g., participants whose
high baseline function makes them unable to improve an
MCID) and 2) validity concerns when applying MCIDs
estimated from randomized clinical trial samples to com-
munity populations (24).

assessment. Physical activity was
monitored using the ActiGraph GT1M uniaxial accelerom-
eter
(25).
Trained
research
personnel
gave
uniform
scripted in-person instructions to wear the accelerometer
for 7 consecutive days on a belt at the natural waistline
in line with the right axilla upon arising in the morning
until retiring, except during water activities. Participants
maintained a daily log to record time spent in water and
cycling activities, which may not be fully captured by
accelerometers. Such activity was negligible (interquartile
range [IQR] 0–0 minutes/week) and not utilized in the
present study.
Accelerometer data were analytically filtered using
validated methodology (26,27). Nonwear periods were
defined as $90 minutes with zero activity counts (allowing
for 2 consecutive interrupted minutes with counts ,100)
(7). We identified participants with 4–7 valid monitoring
days (i.e., $10 wear hours per day) needed for reliable
physical activity estimates (7). Thresholds used by the
National Cancer Institute on a minute-by-minute basis were
applied to identify intensity levels as sedentary (counts/
minute ,100), nonsedentary (counts/minute $100), light
(100–2,019 counts/minute), and moderate-to-vigorous (MV;
counts/minute $2,020) (MV-total) (7), and MV activity accu-
mulated in bouts lasting $10 minutes (MV-bout). Due to
negligible vigorous (counts/minute $5,999) activity (median
0, IQR 0–0 minutes/week) in this cohort, vigorous time and
vigorous bouts were not separately evaluated. Weekly activ-
ity minutes spent at each intensity level are summed from
the daily totals over the monitoring hours and averaged
across valid monitored days; for individuals with 4, 5, or 6
valid days of monitoring, weekly activity minutes were esti-
mated as 7 average daily activity minutes spent at each
intensity level.
Baseline covariates. Demographic factors included age
and sex. BMI was calculated from measured height and
weight (kg/m2) to classify individuals as normal weight
(BMI 18.5–24.9), overweight (BMI 25.0–29.9), or obese

 (BMI $30). If baseline (i.e., OAI 4-year) BMI was missing
(0.2%, n 5 4), the most recent annual assessment was
used as a proxy. Knee OA was identified by a Kellgren/
Lawrence grade of $2 in 1 or both knees assessed from
fixed-flexion knee radiography protocol (28).
Statistical analysis. Candidate metrics (sedentary, non-
sedentary, light, and MV-total) were screened by compar-
ing each to the legacy MV-bout metric, the basis for
assessing current physical activity guidelines. For this
purpose, we calculated the area under the receiver operat-
ing characteristic curve (AUC) to transform the predictive
ability of each metric to a common 0 to 1 scale. For each
legacy and candidate metric we first derived the receiver
operating curve, which is graphically represented by the
metric sensitivity plotted versus the fraction of false
positives (i.e., 1-specificity) in relation to a physical func-
tion outcome. We then determined the AUC area (29).
Candidate metrics that performed at least as well (i.e.,
greater than the AUC) as the legacy MV-bout reference
metric AUC were retained for predictive modeling. Com-
parison of candidate metric AUC with the legacy MV-bout
AUC used a test developed by Delong et al (30).
Thresholds were identified using classification and
regression tree (CART) methodology. We separately pre-
dicted improved/high gait speed and improved/high
PRO physical function. For both outcomes, all candidate
metrics with AUCs that exceeded the reference MV-bout
metric AUC were used as classification tree predictors in
addition to the reference MV-bout metric. A classification
tree identifies the predictors and threshold of the selected
predictor with the strongest relationship to the outcome
based on the criterion of minimum classification error
(31). To avoid overfitting, models were evaluated using
cross-validation subsets and pruned to the most parsimo-
nious model within 1 standard prediction error from
the best-fit model (32). Classification tree analysis was
selected over other traditional methods (e.g., stepwise
logistic regression), given the goal to identify thresholds
in an optimal prediction model (i.e., minimize misclassifi-
cation error) (33,34). Analyses were performed using
Salford Predictive Modeler software, version 8.0 (35).
Classification tree algorithms retain all records having out-
comes; missing predictors are handled by substituting
“surrogate splitters,” which are back-up rules that closely
mimic the primary splitting rules. Recognizing that sys-
tematic differences between people with and without
followup outcomes could influence our findings, we con-
ducted weighted analyses recommended by Hogan et al
(36). For simplicity, we report unweighted analyses
because weighted analyses provided identical findings.
To investigate the stability of thresholds across age, sex,
BMI, and radiographic knee OA presence, we performed
sensitivity analyses. Each factor was separately entered
into a classification tree analysis in addition to physical
activity metrics to predict improved/high function to
explore separate thresholds within the factor investigated.
Other analyses were performed using SAS software, ver-
sion 9.4. Statistical testing was conducted at a 2-sided 5%
significance level.
RESULTS
Participants in the OAI accelerometer substudy with base-
line lower-extremity joint symptoms and subsequent func-
tion outcomes (n 5 1,647) were primarily female (56%),
obese (37%), and ranged in age from 49 to 83 years. The
most common lower-extremity symptoms reported were
knee symptoms (93%, 61% of these had radiographic dis-
ease), followed by hip symptoms (60%), foot symptoms

 (12%), and ankle symptoms (11%). Both hip and knee
symptoms were reported by 54% of this sample.
The baseline values of the legacy physical activity
metric and candidate metrics are shown in Table 1 by sub-
sequent improved/high function status. At the 2-year fol-
lowup, 34% (500 of 1,476) had improved/high gait speed
and 38% (622 of 1,629) had improved/high PRO physical
function. The baseline legacy MV-bout metric and MV-total
activity metric showed the greatest separation across all
metrics between people who did or did not belong to
improved/high function groups (25% difference or greater).
It is notable that only sedentary time did not significantly
differ between groups for either function measure.
The relative predictive value of each metric to distin-
guish improved/high function status at 2 years is visually
represented by receiver operating characteristic curves
shown in Figure 2A for improved/high gait speed function
and Figure 2B for improved/high PRO physical function.
The calculated AUC indicates all metrics performed better
than a random “coin flip” (AUC 0.5) to predict improved/
high function measures. However, only the MV-total
activity metric had greater AUC than the legacy MV-bout
reference metric to predict both improved/high gait speed
(AUC 0.65 versus 0.60; difference 0.05; 95% CI 0.03, 0.07)
and PRO physical function (AUC 0.59 versus 0.57; differ-
ence 0.02; 95% CI 0.001, 0.03).
Classification tree analysis was used to identify both the
optimal metric and the physical activity threshold to best
predict improved/high function. The MV-total candidate
metric and the reference MV-bout metric were entered as
classification tree predictors. Separate trees were grown to
predict improved/high gait speed and improved/high PRO
physical function outcomes. The optimal classification
trees are shown in Figure 3. The MV-total metric was
selected over MV-bout as the best predictor of both out-
comes, consistent with the Figure 2 AUC analyses. The
optimal threshold to predict improved/high objective gait
speed physical function was 45 MV-total minutes/week.
The optimal minimum threshold to predict improved/
high PRO physical function was 47 MV-total minutes per
week.
Sensitivity analyses investigated whether optimal phys-
ical activity thresholds were specific to age, sex, presence/
absence of knee OA, or BMI. Each factor was separately
entered in addition to MV-total and MV-bout into a classi-
fication tree analysis to predict improved/high function in
gait speed and in PRO physical function. Seven of the 8
sensitivity classification tree analyses (i.e., 4 exposure
factors 3 2 outcome trees) solely selected an MV-total
threshold (MV-total thresholds of 45 minutes/week for gait
speed and 47 minutes/week for PRO physical function).
One of the 8 sensitivity analyses to predict improved/high
gait speed initially split on age (age #69 years MV-total
threshold: 46 minutes/week, age .69 years threshold:
none). Further investigation of the age .69 years subgroup
identified a candidate MV-total threshold (10 minutes/
week), but the improvement in prediction accuracy was
insufficient for retention (i.e., below the 1 SE rule criterion).
These sensitivity analyses demonstrate good stability of the
MV-total thresholds.
Table 2 summarizes the ability of the thresholds to pre-
dict subsequent improved/high function based on relative
risks (RRs). The optimal gait speed MV-total threshold
(.45
minutes/week)
better
discriminated
subsequent
improved/high function status than the current guideline
(MV-bout $150 minutes/week) demonstrated by the stron-
ger RR (1.8 versus 1.4). Similarly, the optimal PRO physi-
cal function MV-total threshold (.47 minutes/week) had
a higher RR (1.4 versus 1.3) to predict improved/high
function than the current guideline.
Recognizing that a common threshold has communica-
tion advantages for public health applications, we further

 investigated the predictive ability of both MV-total thresh-
olds for each functional outcome. Specifically, we evalu-
ated if evidence supported a conceptually easier 45
minutes/week target for a common MV-total threshold.
Table 2 illustrates the threshold predictive ability of MV-
total .45 minutes/week compared to MV-total .47
minutes/week to distinguish improved/high gait speed as
identical (RR 1.8 versus 1.8) or PRO physical function (RR
1.4 versus 1.4). The similar performance across the func-
tional outcomes tested supports a common MV-total .45-
minute threshold to predict subsequent improved/high
function.
DISCUSSION
The primary finding from this longitudinal study of adults
with lower-extremity joint symptoms (n 5 1,647) supports
a minimum threshold of 45 minutes/week physical activ-
ity of MV-total activity to improve low function or sustain
high function over 2 years. Attaining this evidence-based
threshold better predicted improved/high function in gait
speed and PRO physical function than the current federal
physical activity threshold and represents a less stringent
standard than current guidelines (i.e., MV-bout $150
minutes/week). For adults with lower-extremity joint
symptoms who often do little or no moderate activity, a
less demanding physical activity target tied to function
may be a valuable intermediate benchmark towards meet-
ing the current physical activity guideline.
To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate
aerobic physical activity thresholds related to functional
outcomes for adults living with lower-extremity joint
symptoms. Evidence supporting the World Health Organi-
zation and US physical activity guidelines for adults was
initially based on consensus of evidence for cardiovascu-
lar benefits related to the 150 MV-bout minute/week
threshold (37). An extensive literature now supports
broad morbidity and mortality benefits of meeting this
guideline. A systematic literature review concluded that
engaging in recommended levels of physical activity
could reduce the risk of developing cardiovascular dis-
ease, stroke, hypertension, colon and breast cancer, type 2
diabetes mellitus, and osteoporosis based on the most
methodologically sound studies (38). Moreover, guideline
adherence could result in 20% or greater reduced risk for
premature all-cause mortality among adults with chronic
disease (38–40). Despite strong evidence for meeting cur-
rent physical activity guidelines to support cardiovascular
health and a wide range of potential health benefits for the
general adult population, many adults with mobility-
limiting conditions fail to achieve this goal. Fewer than
11% of US adults with knee OA achieve current physical
activity guidelines (41). This problem motivates investi-
gating potential intermediate thresholds related to differ-
ent health benefits, in order to encourage adults with
lower-joint symptoms to pursue physical activity.
Being physically active can improve function and
reduce
joint
symptoms
among
adults
with
lower-
extremity conditions. Randomized clinical trials demon-
strate the benefit of physical activity programs to improve
physical function in adults with lower-extremity condi-
tions, including hip and knee OA (42–45). Nonstructured
moderate activity, such as walking, can improve function
and reduce symptomatic pain, fatigue, and stiffness
among adults with rheumatic disease (46,47).
Longitudinal studies support a dose-response relation-
ship between physical activity and function. A systematic
review of the long-term effect of physical activity among
older adults having knee pain found no evidence of wors-
ened symptoms related to pain, loss of physical function,
or progression in structural disease (48). One case–control
study concluded that increasing levels of regular physical
activity was associated with a lower risk of disease pro-
gression to total knee replacement (49). Adults with
mobility-limiting
conditions
such
as
knee
OA
who
achieved current physical activity guidelines by engaging
in low-impact physical activity experienced substantial
improvement in physical function, pain, and quality of
life. Although the benefits from physical activity to
improve function are recognized, the minimum time com-
mitment needed to experience health benefits is not
known (50).
Physical activity decreases with older age. Physical
activity studies of adults based on objective accelerometer
monitoring indicate only 10–15% of community-dwelling
adults meet national guidelines, even after adjusting for
age-related decline in physical activity capacity (6,51).
This reality, combined with a dose-response relationship
between physical activity and health, motivates clinical
advice not to abandon guidelines, but to encourage older
adults to pursue achievable incremental increases in
physical activity (52). People who endure symptomatic
joint disease often have a more difficult time being physi-
cally active than the general population and are at ele-
vated risk for functional loss (52,53). Needed for this large
population group is evidence to specify the amount and
the intensity of physical activity associated with good
functional outcomes.

 Our study directly addressed the need for an evidence-
based threshold for adults with lower-extremity symptoms
by identifying physical activity metrics and thresholds that
best predicted improved function or maintenance of high
functional ability over a 2-year period. A big data approach
using classification prediction trees identified that a mini-
mum threshold of 45 total minutes of physical activity of at
least moderate intensity acquired over 1 week predicted
improved/high function in both objectively measured and
PRO physical function. Sensitivity analyses indicated these
MV-total thresholds were stable independent of sex, BMI,
the presence of knee OA, and age. This evidence-based
threshold predicting good functional outcomes is different
from the current guideline in 2 ways. First, the selected
MV-total metric captured all weekly time spent in activities
of at least moderate intensity, as opposed to the legacy met-
ric that included only MV activity time acquired in bouts
lasting at least 10 minutes. For people with lower-
extremity symptoms, the removal of the 10-minute bout
constraint is a realistic step forward to increase activity lev-
els in a symptomatic population, because those symptoms
can inhibit deconditioned people (like those with joint
issues) from being able to sustain 10 minutes of MV physi-
cal activity. Second, the evidence-based threshold requires
a lower physical activity dose (i.e., fewer weekly minutes
of MV activity) than current guidelines. The identified
evidence-based MV-total .45 minutes/week threshold
related to improved/high function is less stringent than the
current aerobic guideline, but does not replace the current
guideline, which supports many other health benefits.
Strengths of the study included prospective data collec-
tion across multiple sites, the large sample size, the objec-
tive assessment of physical activity, and the age and sex
diversity of this cohort. Study limitations need to be con-
sidered in interpreting results. The OAI sample does not
represent the general population. The present sample was
composed of adults with lower-extremity joint symptoms
from a cohort having or at high risk for developing knee
OA. This sample may include a larger proportion of adults
with symptomatic knees than the general population with
lower-extremity symptoms, which may influence the gen-
eralizability of these results. However, the intentional
stratified OAI recruitment produced a diverse cohort
across age and sex. Although the OAI ascertainment of hip
symptoms used a longer time frame than foot, ankle, or
knee symptom ascertainment, 90% of people reporting
hip symptoms would be in the sample solely due to their
additional report of other lower-extremity joints. It is nota-
ble that physical activity thresholds held within sub-
groups, with and without radiographic evidence of knee
OA, support the robustness of these findings to disease
status. Although an important methodologic strength is
the objective measurement of physical activity using
accelerometers, it is recognized the accelerometers used
cannot capture water activities and may underestimate
activities with minimal vertical acceleration/deceleration,
such as cycling. However, time spent in these activities
was negligible. It is acknowledged that other outcome def-
initions may yield different thresholds, and unreported
treatments or factors may influence outcomes. Causation
cannot be inferred from these observational data. Further
research is warranted to confirm these findings
The current study supports an intermediate threshold to
spend at least 45 minutes/week in accumulated physical
activity of at least moderate intensity among adults having
lower-extremity joint symptoms. This threshold to sup-
port improved/high function represents a less demanding
goal than current federal physical activity guidelines in 2
ways. First, all time spent in MV activities contributes to
attaining this function-related minimum threshold, in
contrast to the current MV-bout threshold, which is only
met through activity acquired in bouts lasting at least 10
minutes. Second, a minimum of 45 minutes/week may
represent a more feasible activity goal than the current
physical activity guideline of 150 minutes/week. Success
in meeting the MV-total threshold of 45 minutes/week
increased the likelihood of functional preservation in
high-functioning persons and functional improvement in
those with functional limitations, providing an intermedi-
ate goal towards achieving the current aerobic physical
activity guideline.
