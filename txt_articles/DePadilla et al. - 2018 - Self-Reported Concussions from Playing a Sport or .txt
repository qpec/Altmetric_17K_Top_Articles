Self-Reported Concussions from Playing a Sport or Being Physically Active 
Among High School Students — United States, 2017

Increased susceptibility to concussions and longer recovery 
times among high school athletes compared with older athletes 
(1) make concussions among youths playing a sport or being 
physically active an area of concern. Short-term and long-term 
sequelae of concussions can include cognitive, affective, and 
behavioral changes (1). Surveillance methods used to monitor 
concussions among youths likely underestimate the preva-
lence. Estimates assessed from emergency departments miss 
concussions treated outside hospitals, those generated using 
high school athletic trainer reports miss concussions sustained 
outside of school-based sports (2), and both sources miss 
medically untreated concussions. To estimate the prevalence 
of concussions among U.S. high school students related to 
playing a sport or being physically active, CDC analyzed data 
from the 2017 national Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS). 
Overall, 15.1% of students (approximately 2.5 million*) 
reported having at least one of these concussions during the 
12 months before the survey, and 6.0% reported two or more 
concussions. Concussion prevalence was significantly higher 
among male students than among female students and among 
students who played on a sports team than among students 
who did not. Among all sex, grade, and racial/ethnic subgroups, 
the odds of reporting a concussion increased significantly with 
the number of sports teams on which students played. These 
findings underscore the need to 1) foster a culture of safety in 
which concussion prevention and management is explicitly 
addressed; 2) expand efforts to educate students, parents, 
coaches, and health care providers regarding the risk for con-
cussion; and 3) identify programs, policies, and practices that 
prevent concussions.
YRBS is a biennial, cross-sectional, school-based survey that 
uses a three-stage cluster sampling design to produce nationally 
representative samples of public and private school students in 
grades 9–12 (3). In accordance with local parent permission 
procedures, students voluntarily completed an anonymous, 
self-administered questionnaire during one class period and 
recorded their responses on a computer-scannable answer sheet. 
An institutional review board at CDC approved the protocol 
for the national YRBS. In 2017, the school response rate was 
* The National Center for Education Statistics estimated that in 2017, a total of 
16,451,000 youths were enrolled in public and private high schools. This number 
was multiplied by the estimated prevalence of one or more and then two or more 
concussions related to sports or physical activity found in this study.
75%, the student response rate was 81%, the overall response 
rate was 60%,† and the sample size was 14,765.
In 2017, CDC included a question about concussions on 
the national YRBS questionnaire for the first time. Following 
a definition of concussion (“when a blow or a jolt to the head 
causes problems such as headaches, dizziness, being dazed or 
confused, difficulty remembering or concentrating, vomiting, 
blurred vision, or being knocked out”), students were asked, 
“During the past 12 months, how many times did you have 
a concussion from playing a sport or being physically active?” 
Response options were: “0 times, 1 time, 2 times, 3 times, and 
4 or more times.” Sports team participation was assessed with 
the question, “During the past 12 months, on how many sports 
teams did you play? (Count any teams run by your school 
or community groups.)” Response options were “0 teams, 
1 team, 2 teams, and 3 or more teams.” Prevalence estimates 
were computed overall and by sex (female or male), grade (9, 
10, 11, or 12), the number of sports teams on which students 
played (0, 1, 2, or ≥3), and race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white 
[white], non-Hispanic black [black], or Hispanic). The number 
of students in other racial/ethnic subgroups was too small for 
meaningful analysis.
Sampling weights were applied to each student record to 
adjust for nonresponse and the oversampling of black and 
Hispanic students. For all analyses, statistical software was 
used that took into account the complex sampling design 
and sampling weights. Chi-square tests were used to identify 
associations between student characteristics and having had 
0, 1, 2, 3, or ≥4 concussions. T-tests were used for pairwise 
comparisons when a chi-square test result was significant. 
Among students who played on at least one sports team, the 
association between the number of teams on which students 
played and concussion was evaluated for each demographic 
subgroup using unadjusted logistic regression models. First, 
number of sports teams was treated as a categorical variable and 
then, to test for a linear association, as a continuous variable.
Overall, 9.1% of high school students reported one con-
cussion, 3.0% reported two, 1.0% reported three, and 2.0% 
reported four or more concussions related to sports or physi-
cal activity during the 12 months before the survey (Table 1). 
Thus, 15.1% of students reported having at least one concus-
sion, and 6.0% reported having two or more. Male students

were more likely to report one, two, and four or more concus-
sions than were female students. Students in grades 9, 10, and 
11 were more likely to report a single concussion than were 
students in grade 12, and students in grade 9 were more likely 
to report a single concussion than were students in grade 10. 
Black and Hispanic students were more likely to report four 
or more concussions than were white students. Students who 
played on at least one sports team were more likely to report 
one, two, three, and four or more concussions than were those 
who did not play on any teams.
Among students who played on one, two, and three or more 
sports teams, the prevalence of reporting having had at least 
one concussion was 16.7%, 22.9%, and 30.3%, respectively 
(Table 2). Among students who played on at least one sports 
team, for all demographic subgroups, the odds of reporting a 
concussion increased with an increasing number of teams on 
which students played (Table 3).
Discussion
In 2017, an estimated 2.5 million high school students 
reported having at least one concussion related to sports or 
physical activity during the year preceding the YRBS, and an 
estimated 1.0 million students reported having two or more 
concussions during the same time frame. The findings suggest 
that students who played on a sports team had a significantly 
higher risk for one or more concussions than did students who 
did not play on a team. Furthermore, concussions were signifi-
cantly more common among students who played on two and 
three or more sports teams than among those who played on 
one team. The prevalence of having one or more concussions 
(15.1%) is comparable to the findings of an analysis of 2013 
YRBS data from three states that added different questions to 
their survey to assess sports-related concussions among high 
school athletes. In that study, the prevalence ranged from 
17.6% to 20.1% (4). The prevalence of concussions in the 
current study is higher than estimates based on emergency 
department data (e.g., 622.5 visits per 100,000 population 
aged 10–14 years) (5) and athletic trainer reports (e.g., 1.8 per 
100 high school and college athletes for an average season) (6). 
Emergency department data miss concussions treated else-
where, and athletic trainer reports miss concussions sustained 
outside of school-based sports; both sources miss medically 
untreated concussions (2).

§ Weighted percentages are presented. Weighted percentages might not add to 100 because of rounding.
Although increased awareness and recognition might result 
in higher rates of reported concussions (1), underreporting 
of concussions among athletes remains an important issue. A 
study of high school athletes found that among athletes with 
concussions, 40% reported that their coach was unaware of 
their symptoms (7). Students might not always recognize or 
remember that they have experienced a concussion, or they 
might not want to report having experienced a concussion. 
In this study, the opportunity to anonymously self-report a 
concussion, without negative consequences, such as a loss of 
playing time, might have aided in including concussions missed 
by other data sources. However, this study might overestimate 
the prevalence of concussions related to sports or physical 
activity if students reported concussions occurring before the 
12-month reference period (8) or mistakenly thought that they 
had a concussion because some symptoms of a concussion, such 
as a headache, also occur in the absence of a concussion (9).
The findings in this report are subject to at least four limita-
tions. First, these concussions, self-reported by students, were 
not validated (e.g., through medical record review). Second, 
these data apply only to high school students who attend school 
and are not representative of all youths in this age group or 
in other age groups. Nationwide, in 2013, approximately 5% 
of persons aged 16–17 years were not enrolled in high school 
and lacked a high school credential.§ Third, continuing to 
play sports or be physically active with a concussion that is 
symptomatic increases the risk for a subsequent, more seri-
ous concussion (10). YRBS data found that 6% of students

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
A concussion is a type of traumatic brain injury. Surveillance 
efforts likely miss some concussions related to sports and 
physical activity among youths. 
What is added by this report?
The 2017 Youth Risk Behavior Survey found that 15.1% of 
students reported having at least one concussion related to 
sports or physical activity, and 6.0% reported having two or 
more. Playing on more than one sports team was found to 
further increase the risk for concussion.
What are the implications for public health practice?
It is important to expand education about the risk for concus-
sion, the signs and symptoms of concussion, the need to 
remove athletes with a suspected concussion from play, the 
evaluation of concussions, and the protocol for athletes’ safe 
return to school and play.
reported two or more concussions, but YRBS data do not allow 
for determining the proportion of concussions that might 
have been related to a previous concussion that had not fully 
healed. Finally, it is not known what proportion of concussions 
occurred during team sports participation versus other types 
of physical activity.
A 2014 National Academy of Sciences report concluded 
that, in light of the limitations of existing surveillance systems, 
more comprehensive estimates of youth sports concussions are 
needed (1). This study, and state-level YRBS data (4), support 
this conclusion by suggesting that many concussions among

youths are not being counted and might also indicate that 
similar comprehensive estimates below the high school level 
are needed. To that end, CDC is working toward developing 
a National Concussion Surveillance System to determine the 
incidence and identify the circumstances of concussions, and 
all traumatic brain injuries, across the lifespan (2).
The findings in this report support the need to continue 
education efforts addressing concussion risk associated with 
sports and physical activity, and indicate a need for messaging 
targeted toward students who play on multiple sports teams. 
Additionally, black and Hispanic students were more likely 
to report four or more concussions than were white students; 
targeted messaging might be needed to educate these groups in 
particular about the risks associated with sustaining multiple 
concussions. In addition, coaches and parents can encour-
age athletes to follow the rules of play for their sport with an 
emphasis on player safety, which might reduce the incidence 
and severity of concussions (1,10). It is important that any 
athlete with a suspected concussion be removed from practice 
and competition and not return to play without the clearance 
of a health care provider (10). Continuing to play with a 
concussion might worsen symptoms (1) and increase the risk 
for a second concussion; therefore, it is crucial to talk with 
athletes about the importance of reporting their concussion 
symptoms (10). Among recreational activities, bicycle helmets 
have been shown to reduce head injuries (1). There is a need 
to expand programs, policies, and practices, tailored to specific 
audiences, to ensure that all students, parents, coaches, teach-
ers, and health care providers know how to prevent, recognize, 
and manage concussions. It is critical that these stakeholders 
know how to safely return students to school and to play fol-
lowing a concussion.
