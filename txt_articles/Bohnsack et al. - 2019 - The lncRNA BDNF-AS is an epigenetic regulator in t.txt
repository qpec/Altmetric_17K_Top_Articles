Abstract
Adolescent alcohol drinking is known to contribute to the development and severity of alcohol use disorders (AUDs)
later in adulthood. Recent studies have shown that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are critical for brain development
and synaptic plasticity. One such lncRNA is natural occurring brain-derived neurotrophic factor antisense (BDNF-AS)
that has been shown to regulate BDNF expression. The role of BDNF-AS lncRNA in the molecular mechanisms of AUD
is unknown. Here, we evaluated the expression and functional role of BDNF-AS in postmortem amygdala of either early
onset or late onset alcoholics (individuals who began drinking before or after 21 years of age, respectively) and age-
matched control subjects. BDNF-AS expression is increased in early onset but not in late onset AUD amygdala and
appears to be regulated epitranscriptomically via decreased N6-methyladenosine on BDNF-AS. Upregulation of BDNF-
AS is associated with a significant decrease in BDNF expression and increased recruitment of EZH2, which deposits
repressive H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) at regulatory regions in the BDNF gene in the early onset AUD group.
Drinking during adolescence also contributed to significant decreases in activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated
protein (ARC) expression which also appeared to be mediated by increased EZH2 deposition of repressive H3K27me3
at the ARC synaptic activity response element. These results suggest an important role for BDNF-AS in the regulation of
synaptic plasticity via epigenetic reprogramming in the amygdala of AUD subjects who began drinking during
adolescence.
Introduction
Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) are chronic, debilitating
psychiatric
illnesses
that
contribute
to
considerable
socioeconomic and health burden worldwide1. Age of
onset is one of the primary risk factors for the develop-
ment of AUDs, as individuals who began drinking during
adolescence are four times more likely to develop AUDs
in adulthood2. Adolescence is a critical period in brain
development and adolescent drinking decreases orbito-
frontal cortex activity and increases amygdala activity3
leading
to
less
executive
control,
more
emotional
impulsivity, alterations in decision-making, and have a
higher risk to engage in risky behaviors and develop
mental health problems later in life4,5. The amygdala acts
as a hub for the processing of sensory signaling from
cortical regions, and is involved in regulation of emotional
reactivity, decision-making, and negative affective state of
alcohol addiction6,7. During adolescence, the amygdala
undergoes several key changes in specific inter- and intra-
region connectivity8, and this process is thought to be
disrupted by alcohol use9. Recent studies have begun to
examine the molecular basis of these changes in the
amygdala in preclinical models of adolescent alcohol
exposure and have identified numerous potential mole-
cular components, such as brain-derived neurotrophic
factor (BDNF), that are involved in the development of
alcohol dependence in adulthood10–12.

 The neurotrophin BDNF has emerged as a critical
molecular player in central nervous system (CNS) devel-
opment, psychiatric disorders, and AUDs13–15. BDNF is
associated with survival and differentiation of neurons,
activity-dependent neuroplasticity, long-term potentia-
tion, learning, memory, and anxiety13,16. BDNF is critical
for normal brain development, as constitutive knockout
mice die during second week after birth13 and is known to
be involved in synaptogenesis and maintenance of den-
drites during development and adulthood13,17. BDNF
regulates synaptic plasticity through interactions with the
tropomyosin-related
kinase
B
(TrkB)
receptor
and
induction of several signaling cascades that are involved in
the regulation of synaptic plasticity and cAMP-responsive
element-binding
protein
(CREB)-dependent
gene
expression13. Decreased expression of BDNF in the
amygdala of rodent models of adolescent alcohol expo-
sure has recently been implicated in anxiety-like and
alcohol-drinking behaviors12. Furthermore, mutant ver-
sions of BDNF with decreased TrkB activity are associated
with increase in alcohol consumption.14,15,18. A particu-
larly important downstream target of BDNF signaling is
activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (ARC)
which is a member of the immediate-early gene family
and is important in synaptogenesis and synaptic plasticity
as well as anxiety and alcohol intake phenotypes19–21.
BDNF activates ARC expression through CREB and other
transcription factor binding to the synaptic activity
response element (SARE) site located in the ARC pro-
moter approximately 7 kb upstream from the transcrip-
tion start site22,23.
In addition to complex signaling, the BDNF gene also
has a complex regulatory and genetic structure, with 9
different promoters encoding at least 20 different splice
variants sharing one common exon that encodes the
BDNF protein (known as exon IX)13,24 and expression of
these variants are temporal- and region-specific25. Studies
in animal models have revealed that different BDNF
transcript variants are downregulated in the amygdala by
adolescent alcohol exposure and associated with alcohol
intake in adulthood12.
Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are broadly defined
as RNAs that are greater than 200 bp and lack a functional
open-reading frame. The majority of lncRNAs are found
exclusively in the brain and are important in normal brain
development, with temporal and regional specificity26–28.
Most lncRNAs with described function are involved in
regulating gene expression and chromatin structure
through a number of different mechanisms including cis-
tether, trans-regulation, allosteric modulators of epige-
netic complexes (e.g. polycomb repressive complex II,
PRC2) or transcription factors, or acting as a decoy either
for transcription factors or repressors29–31. LncRNAs
have recently been identified as being important in AUDs
in adults32. Despite several advances in the understanding
of lncRNA function, the function of the vast majority of
lncRNAs are still unknown. A recent study characterized
the role of the lncRNA BDNF-antisense (BDNF-AS) to be
a negative regulator of BDNF exon IX expression and
neurogenesis, and also described the overlap region
between BDNF and BDNF-AS33. However, changes in
BDNF and BDNF-AS expression and associated epigenetic
regulatory mechanisms in the amygdala of human AUD
subjects are currently unknown. We aimed to determine if
there are epigenetic changes mediated by BDNF-AS that
are operative in the regulation of BDNF expression in
adolescence, and whether these changes persist into
adulthood in the amygdala of human postmortem brains
diagnosed with AUDs that began drinking before the age
of 21. Here we report that the epitranscriptome and epi-
genetic mechanisms interact to regulate BDNF expression
in the amygdala and are possibly involved in the patho-
physiology of alcoholism that begins with drinking during
adolescence.
Materials and methods
Samples
Human postmortem amygdala tissue was acquired from
the New South Wales Brain Tissue Resource Center
(Sydney, Australia). Criteria for inclusion of AUD samples
were: age >18 years, no history of major psychiatric dis-
orders, and no history of other substance abuse disorders.
Demographic characteristics are provided in Supple-
mentary Table 1. We have previously described this
cohort34. Detailed methods are provided in Supplemen-
tary Information.
Quantitative real-time PCR for mRNA levels
Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) was run using
standard methods with either Taqman probes or specific
primers (Supplementary Table 2). Changes in expression
were determined using the ΔΔCt method and normalized
to mean Ct values of ACTB and GAPDH. Data are pre-
sented as average fold change of controls.
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for protein levels
BDNF protein was ascertained via the Quantikine
ELISA total BDNF Assay (R&D Systems) following the
manufacturer’s instructions. The optical density of each
sample and standard was measured using the Spectra MR
microplate reader (Dynex Technologies) and the amount
of BDNF was calculated against the BDNF standard curve
and expressed as pg/µg of total protein (Supplementary
Methods).
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was run fol-
lowing previously published protocols35,36. Purified DNA

Page 2 of 11
 was analyzed by qPCR using primers (Supplementary
Table 2). The data were analyzed using the ΔΔCt method,
normalizing to input, and the data are expressed as fold
change relative to controls.
RNA methylation immunoprecipitation (M6A RIP) assay
M6A
RIP
was
performed
using
EpiMark®
N6-
methyladenosine Enrichment Kit (NEB) following the
manufacturer’s instructions with some modifications.
Purified RNA was sheared to <350 bp using a Covaris
ME220 and then purified using Zymo RNA Clean and
Concentrator 5 (Zymo) following the manufacturer’s
instructions. Purified RNA was then measured for con-
centration using the Qubit BR RNA Assay (ThermoFisher
Scientific) following the manufacturer’s instructions, and
1 µg was used for each pulldown with 2 µL of M6A
antibody. Following 1 h incubation and washes, RNA was
eluted and purified with MyOne Silane Beads (Thermo-
Fisher Scientific) then prepared for reverse transcriptase
in which 1 µL from pulldown or input was put in reverse
transcriptase reaction. Resulting cDNA was then used for
qPCR using primers designed to predict M6A sites loca-
ted on BDNF-AS (Supplementary Table 2). M6A sites
were predicted using SRAMP37. The data were analyzed
using the ΔΔCt method, normalizing to input, and the
data are expressed as fold change relative to controls.
Statistics
Statistical analysis was performed using SigmaStat
(Systat Software, San Jose, CA, USA) and data were
visualized using GraphPad Prism (La Jolla, CA, USA).
Comparisons between groups were performed with Stu-
dent’s t-tests. If comparisons failed normality tests then
Mann–Whitney rank sum tests were performed. Pear-
son’s correlations were performed to determine linear
correlation between two groups. Significance was set at
p < 0.05.
Results
Expression of BDNF and BDNF-AS in the postmortem
amygdala
Previous studies in rodents have demonstrated a
decrease in BDNF expression after adolescent alcohol
exposure in the amygdala12, but similar changes in the
human amygdala have not yet been examined. In order to
identify potential changes that are due to adolescent
drinking we evaluated both a cohort that began drinking
before the age of 21 (early onset) and a cohort who began
drinking after the age of 21 (late onset). We then analyzed
these two cohorts to see if there was differences in
drinking or other demographics. We found that our early
onset group drank 234 ± 56 g (mean ± SEM) of alcohol
per day at time of death versus the late onset group which
drank 157 ± 28 g of alcohol per day at time of death,
although this observation was not statistically significant
between early onset and late onset groups (Supplementary
Table 1). We also found that there was no statistically
significant differences in other metrics evaluated, includ-
ing age, postmortem interval (PMI), total drinking years,
and cigarette pack years (Supplementary Table 1).
We then evaluated BDNF mRNA expression at the
common coding exon (BDNF exon IX) and found a sig-
nificant decrease in BDNF mRNA expression in early
onset AUD compared to controls (p = 0.008) (Fig. 1a).
Regulation of BDNF expression is complex25,26; however,
a previous study has demonstrated that increased BDNF-
AS
leads
to
decreased
BDNF
mRNA
expression33.
Therefore, we examined changes in the expression of
lncRNA BDNF-AS in the postmortem amygdala of alco-
holics who began drinking before the age of 21 to deter-
mine
if
this
was
a
regulatory
pathway
potentially
regulating decreased BDNF mRNA expression. BDNF-AS
expression was increased in the early onset group (p =
0.033) (Fig. 1b). We also evaluated changes in both BDNF
mRNA and BDNF-AS expression in the postmortem
amygdala in the late onset group to determine if these
changes were specific to early age onset group. There was
no significant change in either BDNF mRNA (Fig. 1c) or
BDNF-AS (Fig. 1d) expression in the late onset group.
We next analyzed correlations between BDNF and
BDNF-AS expression versus changes in several drinking
variables (total drinking years, alcohol daily use at time of
death (in grams), and standard drinks per week) to
determine if there was any relationship. We first analyzed
the correlation between BDNF and BDNF-AS expression
and found that BDNF and BDNF-AS mRNA levels are
negatively correlated (r = −0.0443, p = 0.003). We then
evaluated whether changes in BDNF-AS expression was a
function of total drinking years, alcohol daily use at the
time of death, and standard drinks per week. We found
that BDNF-AS expression in total samples (n = 42) was
positively correlated with alcohol daily use at time of
death (r = 0.523, p = 0.0004) and standard drinks per
week (r = 0.466 p = 0.002) but not total drinking years
(Supplementary Fig. 1). Examination of AUD subjects
who began drinking before the age of 21 revealed that
BDNF-AS trended towards being significantly correlated
with alcohol use per day at time of death (r = 0.567,
p = 0.069), but this was not the case for controls
(r = 0.212, p = 0.37) or in the late onset group (r = 0.258,
p = 0.45) (Supplementary Fig. 1). Similarly, BDNF mRNA
expression in total samples (n = 42) negatively correlated
with alcohol per day use at time of death (r = −0.416,
p = 0.0062) and standard drinks per week (r = −0.374 and
p = 0.015) but not total drinking years (r = −0.253,
p = 0.106) (Supplementary Fig. 1). When we determined
correlations of BDNF mRNA expression separately versus
standard drinks or alcohol daily use at time of death in

 only early onset drinker and late onset drinker groups we
found no significant correlations. However, we did
observe a trend towards significant correlation for BDNF
and both alcohol use per day at time of death (r = −0.431,
p = 0.058) and standard drinks per week (r = −0.43,
p = 0.058) (Supplementary Fig. 1) for controls. We also
found that there was no statistically significant correla-
tions in other metrics evaluated: age, PMI, and cigarette
pack years.
BDNF protein levels in the postmortem amygdala
Concentration of total (free and TrkB bound) BDNF
protein in postmortem human amygdala of AUDs and
control
subjects
was
determined
via
enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay. Average (mean ± SEM) BDNF
protein (pg/μg of total protein) in controls (0.228 ± 0.011;
n = 22) was not significantly different than total alcoholics
(0.192 ± 0.019; n = 22). However, further analysis by
separation of alcoholics by age of onset of drinking
revealed a significant (p = 0.043) decrease in BDNF pro-
tein levels in subjects (n = 11) in the early onset group
(0.177 ± 0.029) versus controls (0.228 ± 0.011; n = 22)
(Fig. 1e). Interestingly, no significant (p = 0.31) differences
were observed in the late onset group (0.207 ± 0.025;
n = 11) versus controls (0.228 ± 0.011; n = 22) (Fig. 1f).
BDNF protein levels in total samples (n = 42) were sig-
nificantly negatively correlated with both standard drinks
per week (r = −0.377, p = 0.014) and alcohol use per day
at time of death (r = −0.376, p = 0.0142). When we
determined correlation of BDNF protein expression
separately in controls, early, and late of onset drinkers
with standard drinks per week and alcohol use per day at
time of death, we found no significant correlations similar
to what was found with BDNF mRNA correlations
(Supplementary Fig. 2).
Epigenetic modifications at the BDNF gene in the
postmortem amygdala
Previous reports in rodent models of adolescent alcohol
exposure have demonstrated that changes in BDNF
expression is due to changes in epigenetic modifications.
Particularly, deficits in histone acetylation (H3K9/14ac) of
BDNF exon IV promoter was associated with deficits in
BDNF expression12. Further, BDNF-AS is known to con-
tribute to epigenetic changes facilitated by the PRC2
complex at the BDNF exon IX promoter in HEK293
cells33.
To
evaluate
if
changes
observed
in
BDNF
expression were due to epigenetic changes, we utilized
ChIP assay to determine if there were differences in
enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) occupancy and its
catalytic
product,
repressive
H3K27
trimethylation
(H3K27me3), at several sites in the BDNF promoter
region (Fig. 2a) and at a region where BDNF exon IX and
BDNF-AS overlap33. We evaluated EZH2 occupancy at
these loci. We observed increases in EZH2 at both the
BDNF-IX promoter (p = 0.023) and overlap region (p =
0.027) in the early onset AUD group. The overlap region
(Fig. 2a) is the region of overlap between transcribed
BDNF and BDNF-AS transcripts (located in the common
exon IX of BDNF and exon 5 of BDNF-AS)33. At the
BDNF-IV promoter, though there appears to be a trend
(p = 0.084) towards an increase in the early onset group
(Fig. 2b). We observed no changes in EZH2 occupancy at
any of the loci in the late onset group (Fig. 2c). There were
significant increases in H3K27me3 associated with the
BDNF-IV (p = 0.014) and BDNF-IX (p = 0.049) promoters
and also at the overlap region (p = 0.003) (Fig. 2d) in the
early onset group. In the late onset group, there was only
an increase (p = 0.027) in H3K27me3 at the BDNF-IV
promoter (Fig. 2e). We examined for correlations between
repressive H3K27me3 at the BDNF-IX, promoter, and
BDNF overlap region in total sample (n = 42) with
drinking variables. We found no significant correlations
with either alcohol use per day at the time of death nor
standard drinks per week for either BDNF-IX and BDNF
overlap region.
We next analyzed changes in EZH2 and suppressor of
zeste 12 (SUZ12, another member of the PRC2 complex)
mRNA levels using qPCR to determine if changes in
occupancy of EZH2 could be due to changes in overall
levels. We found no change in either EZH2 or SUZ12
mRNA levels in early onset or late onset postmortem
human amygdala (Supplementary Fig. 3). SUZ12 is a core
component of the PRC2 complex and known binding
partner of lncRNAs30. We therefore performed RIP assay
to test for an interaction between BDNF-AS and SUZ12
protein and found that SUZ12 binds to BDNF-AS as
determined by the RIP assay (Supplementary Fig. 4).
Epigenetic modifications at the ARC SARE site and ARC
mRNA levels in the postmortem amygdala
The early immediate gene ARC is a downstream target
of BDNF, is involved in synaptic plasticity, and is a critical
target of adolescent and adult alcohol exposure in rodent
models12,21. Analysis of changes in ARC expression in
early onset postmortem amygdala shows decreased ARC
(p = 0.016) (Fig. 3a), but not in late onset postmortem
amygdala (Fig. 3b). BDNF signaling is known to regulate
ARC expression through the ARC SARE site located
~7.7 kb upstream of the transcription start site22,23 and is
regulated by enzymes involved in epigenetic modula-
tion22,23, and therefore we examined if there were epige-
netic changes at this location (Fig. 3c). H3K27me3
occupancy
was
increased
at
the
ARC
SARE
site
(p = 0.018) in the early onset AUD group (Fig. 3d). We
next evaluated if this change was mediated by increased
PRC2 signaling and found increased EZH2 associated
with the SARE site in this group as well (p = 0.049)
Bohnsack et al. Translational Psychiatry  (2019) 9:34 
Page 5 of 11
 (Fig. 3e). These changes are not present in the late onset
AUD group (Supplementary Fig. 5). We also found
decreased H3K27ac (a histone post-translational mod-
ification
associated
with
increased
gene
expression)
associated with the SARE site in the early onset AUD
group (p = 0.009) (Fig. 3f).
RNA methylation of BDNF-AS in the postmortem amygdala
We next wanted to determine the mechanism for
BDNF-AS upregulation in early onset AUD subjects.
Our initial experiments focused on H3K4me3 at the
BDNF-AS promoter as this mark is known to be
involved in active transcription and in the regulation of
lncRNAs38,39.
However
we
found
no
significant
increase in H3K4me3 in the early onset group (Sup-
plementary Fig. 6). Recent reports have suggested that
post-translational modifications can modulate lncRNA
expression40 so we utilized N6-methyladenosine (M6A)
RIP assay to determine if there were changes in RNA
methylation at predicted M6A sites in BDNF-AS. Our

elevated at the BDNF-IX promoter and the BDNF and BDNF-AS overlap site in the amygdala of individuals who began drinking before the age of 21.
Significance was determined by Mann–Whitney test. c EZH2 is not elevated at any of the three BDNF sites measured in individuals who began
drinking after the age of 21. Significance was determined by Mann–Whitney test for BDNF-IV, BDNF-IX, and BDNF and BDNF-AS overlap region in later
age of onset. d Early onset in the postmortem amygdala of AUD subjects show increases in repressive H3K27me3 associated with several BDNF gene
locations while e late onset show only increases in repressive H3K27me3 at the BDNF-IV promoter. Significance was determined by Mann–Whitney
test for BDNF-IV for early age of onset and BDNF-IX for both early and late age of onset. Values are presented as mean ± SEM. Significance was
determined using Student’s t-test unless otherwise noted. *p < 0.05 and **p < 0.01. AUD alcohol use disorder. n = 22 (controls), 11 (early onset AUDs)

 results indicate a decrease (p < 0.001) in BDNF-AS
RNA methylation in the early onset AUD group
(Fig. 4a), but not in the late onset AUD group
(Fig. 4b). We did not observe any change in mRNA
expression of several known RNA methyltransferases
or the RNA demethylase ALKBH5 (Supplementary
Fig. 7a–h).
Discussion
This study demonstrates that early age of onset of
alcohol
consumption
increases
BDNF-AS
lncRNA
expression induced via diminished RNA methylation,
which triggers aberrant epigenetic mechanisms to pro-
duce deficits in BDNF signaling in the amygdala and
possibly associated with pathophysiology of AUD (Fig. 5).

 Effects of adolescent drinking and changes in BDNF
signaling in adulthood
BDNF signaling is an important modulator of CNS
development through mediation of important processes
such as neuronal survival, neurogenesis, neurite out-
growth, and neuronal differentiation13,16. Importantly,
expression of both BDNF protein and specific BDNF
mRNA isoforms are developmentally controlled, with
different
areas
of
the
amygdala
showing
different
expression patterns during adolescence and adulthood.
BDNF expression in the central nucleus of amygdala
(CeA) slowly rises to a plateau in adulthood, while the
basolateral amygdala has decreased expression in adult-
hood relative to adolescence41 and disruption to normal
BDNF expression and signaling in adolescence is likely to
produce detrimental outcomes on normal brain devel-
opment. Changes in BDNF signaling are likely to be
involved in structural changes in the amygdala, which
involve synaptic pruning and altered connectivity between
the amygdala and other brain regions throughout the
adolescent period8. Based on the previous finding that
adolescent alcohol exposure in rodents decreases BDNF
expression in the CeA12, our present findings confirm the
hypothesis
that there
would be changes in BDNF
expression in a cohort of postmortem amygdala from
AUD subjects that began drinking during adolescence,
demonstrating a conserved pathway that may induce
increased drinking and other psychiatric problems in
adulthood caused by adolescent alcohol exposure. Pre-
vious work has found that individuals with alcohol
dependence have decreased circulating BDNF in blood42.
Interestingly,
transgenic
mice
harboring
a
homolog
(Val68Met) of a common human polymorphism of BDNF
(Val66Met) compulsively consume more alcohol than
wild-type
mice18.
The
Val68Met
variant
leads
to
decreased intracellular trafficking and activity-dependent
BDNF release and function18. Decreasing BDNF or ARC
expression in the CeA of rodent models of alcoholism in
adulthood increases drinking and anxiety-like behaviors,
which are measures of alcohol dependence21,43. These
previous findings taken together with the present findings
shown here suggest that disruptions to BDNF expression
and ARC signaling are likely to increase the risk for
alcohol dependence, and the risk is greater if these
changes occur at a critical period of brain development44,
such as adolescence, due to enduring effects on epigenetic

Decreased BDNF Expression and Signaling
Decreased ARC Expression and Signaling
Decreased Synaptic Plasticity
Higher Risk of Developing Alcohol Use Disorder in Adulthood
Increased Comorbidity with other Psychiatric Disorders
Fig. 5 Proposed association of regulation of decreased BDNF
expression by BDNF-AS through recruitment of the PRC2 complex in
the human amygdala of individuals who began drinking in
adolescence. Adolescent drinking appears to increase the expression
of BDNF-AS most likely via inhibition of RNA methylation. This is
associated with decreases in BDNF expression in the amygdala via
recruitment of EZH2 and the associated increase in H3K27
trimethylation (H3K27me3) at the promoter and overlap region of
BDNF exon IX. Interestingly, the reduction in BDNF expression is
associated with a reduction in activity-regulated cytoskeleton-
associated protein (ARC) expression, possibly via an increase in
occupancy of EZH2 and H3K27me3 at an important regulatory site of
the ARC gene known as synaptic activity response element (SARE).
These BDNF-AS-regulated epigenetic mechanisms induced by
adolescent drinking in humans appears to be important in the
pathophysiology of alcohol use disorders (AUD) later in life
Fig. 4 BDNF-AS is upregulated by a potential epitranscriptomic
mechanism in early onset group. a Drinking during adolescence
decreases RNA methylation at the predicted M6A site in BDNF-AS.
b Drinking in adulthood does not change methylation at the M6A site
in BDNF-AS. Values are presented as mean ± SEM. Significance was

 programming. However, the possibility cannot be ruled
out that other factors besides drinking during adolescence
are involved with changes in BDNF expression that we
observed in human postmortem amygdala. These factors
could include a longer time period for disruption of
normal neural processes by alcohol and a higher lifetime
alcohol consumption at the time of death.
Potential role of lncRNAs in epigenetic regulation by
adolescent drinking in AUD subjects
LncRNAs have recently emerged as a potential mole-
cular target in AUDs by the use of RNA sequencing32,45.
However, evaluation of lncRNAs in a population of indi-
viduals with AUDs that began drinking before the age of
21 has not been explored. Previous studies have char-
acterized the lncRNA, BDNF-AS, to be a negative reg-
ulator
of
BDNF
expression33.
Rodent
studies
have
demonstrated that infusion of BDNF-antisense oligo-
deoxynucleotides into the CeA increases anxiety and
alcohol consumption43. Therefore, we postulated that the
naturally occurring BDNF-AS may be involved in changes
observed in BDNF expression in our early onset cohort.
We found increased BDNF-AS only in individuals who
began drinking before the age of 21. Additionally, similar
to previous findings demonstrated in vitro33, increased
BDNF-AS negatively correlated with BDNF exon IX
expression. Intriguingly, we also found that BDNF-AS
expression positively correlated with the amount of
alcohol consumed using two different metrics of alcohol
consumption (grams consumed per day at time of
death and standard drinks per week). One possibility
is that earlier age of alcohol use may interact with
later alcohol consumption to induce BDNF-AS expres-
sion. Our results suggest that BDNF-AS may also be
important in epigenetic programming during develop-
ment, and expression of this transcript is dysregulated
after drinking in adolescence and associated with AUDs
later in life.
Our data indicate that BDNF-AS may be regulated
epitranscriptomically by decreased RNA methylation at a
M6A site in the amygdala of early onset AUD but not in
late onset AUD. Previous reports have found that
decreased M6A methylation prevents RNA turnover and
decreases targeted degradation by YTH domain family 2,
which is recruited to the RNA by M6A methylation46.
Other roles for M6A methylation appear to either pro-
mote or inhibit recruitment of proteins that bind RNA47,
a potential mechanism for the binding of SUZ12 to
BDNF-AS and could be explored in future experiments.
Nonetheless, the observation that adolescent alcohol
exposure decreases BDNF-AS methylation in the amyg-
dala reveals new mechanisms of RNA regulation that add
another layer of complexity of epigenetic regulation of
BDNF expression in AUD.
Role of PRC2 complex regulating epigenetic changes in
early onset AUD
LncRNAs have been demonstrated to interact with
SUZ12, a member of the PRC2 complex, via its zinc-finger
domain30, and BDNF-AS knockdown disrupts EZH2
recruitment to BDNF promoters in cell culture models33.
We tested this hypothesis by examining EZH2 occupancy
and its catalytic product, H3K27me3, at regions of the
BDNF promoter, including the region of BDNF exon IX
that overlaps with BDNF-AS. Our results indicate that
there is increased EZH2 recruited to both the BDNF
overlap region and the promoter of BDNF exon IX with
corresponding increases in H3K27me3 at these locations.
Coupled with our data showing that SUZ12 binds directly
to BDNF-AS, this suggests that BDNF-AS regulates
BDNF-IX expression through direct binding and recruit-
ment of the PRC2 complex and subsequent repression of
transcription by deposition of H3K27me3.
In this study, we also found increases of EZH2 and
H3K27me3 at the ARC SARE site. This may be due to
chromatin remodeling secondary to decreased BDNF
signaling and recruitment of class I histone deacetylases
(HDACs)22 catalyzing removal of histone acetyl groups,
which we have also observed. The recruitment of EZH2 to
this site warrants further experimentation to determine if
it occurs through decreased BDNF signaling, subse-
quently decreased occupancy of CREB-binding protein,
and increased occupancy of class I HDACs at the SARE
site of ARC gene. EZH2 is also heavily implicated in brain
development, where it has a role in regulating self-renewal
and differentiation in the cerebral cortex48. Since there is
significant pruning and differentiation of neurons during
adolescence44, EZH2 dysregulation and an increase in
repressive H3K27me3 marks at the BDNF and ARC reg-
ulatory regions by alcohol drinking during this critical
period could contribute to an increased risk of AUDs and
higher overall alcohol consumption later in life (Fig. 5).
Conclusions
Our results appear to suggest that BDNF-AS is upre-
gulated most likely via decreased RNA methylation in the
amygdala of adult AUD population who began drinking
during adolescence, but not in AUD subjects who began
drinking in adulthood. However we are unable to deter-
mine if these effects are causative without further
experimentation, and indeed changes that we observed
could be due to other factors and interactions. Future
experiments will have to consider these possibilities in
larger cohorts of human postmortem brain and through
the use of reverse translational approach in animal
models. We demonstrate that increased BDNF-AS is
associated with decrease in BDNF expression through an
epigenetic mechanism involving the recruitment of PRC2
and the repression of gene promoters. Downstream

 signaling targets of BDNF such as ARC are also decreased
through recruitment of EZH2 and the deposition of
repressive H3K27me3 marks. Our results provide trans-
lational evidence for a mechanism for decreased BDNF in
the amygdala previously shown in rodent models of
adolescent alcohol exposure: namely, similar decreases in
BDNF and ARC that are associated with higher alcohol
intake12. These results suggest the possible role for
developmentally sensitive lncRNAs in early onset AUD,
and that EZH2 inhibitors may prove useful in the treat-
ment of adult psychopathology after adolescent alcohol
drinking.
