ABSTRACT
Objective To summarise all meta-analyses of 
randomised controlled trials that have evaluated the 
effects of exercise therapy on functional capacity in 
patients with chronic diseases.
Design Umbrella review of meta-analyses of 
randomised controlled trials.
Data sources We systematically searched the 
CENTRAL, CINAHL, DARE, Medline, OTSeeker, PEDro, 
SPORTDiscus, ProQuest Nursing & Allied Health 
Database, Web of Science, Scopus, OpenGrey and BMC 
Proceedings from database inception to 1 September 
2016.
Eligibility criteria for selecting studies We 
included meta-analyses that compared the effects of 
exercise therapy with no treatment or usual care in 
adults with non-communicable chronic diseases and 
included outcomes related to functional capacity. We 
excluded meta-analyses with less than 100 patients.
Results Eighty-five meta-analyses with 22 different 
chronic diseases were included. The exercise 
interventions resulted in statistically significant (p<0.05) 
improvements for 126 of 146 (86%) functional capacity 
outcomes, compared with the control group. The 
standardised mean differences were small in 64 (44%), 
moderate in 54 (37%) and large in 28 (19%) of the 146 
functional capacity outcomes. The results were similar 
for aerobic exercise, resistance training, and aerobic and 
resistance training combined. There were no significant 
differences in serious adverse effects between the 
intervention and control groups in any of the meta-
analyses.
Conclusion Exercise therapy appears to be a safe way 
to improve functional capacity and reduce disability in 
individuals with chronic disease.
InTRODuCTIOn
Chronic diseases place high economic burden on 
society and reduce the quality of life of more than 
a billion individuals that live with a disability.1–4 
Furthermore, almost half of the global population 
suffers from at least one chronic disease and may, 
therefore, be at risk for reduced functional capacity 
and disability.5 6 Disability is defined by WHO in 
the International Classification of Functioning, 
Disability and Health (ICF) as ‘an umbrella term 
for impairments, activity limitations and participa-
tion restrictions’.7 Traditionally, medical research 
on physical activity or exercise has focused on the 
effects of exercise on disease risk factors, preven-
tion, possible disease progression and risk of death. 
However, physical functioning is important for the 
activities of daily living of the patient and there is 
a need for more resources for overall patient care, 
particularly among the increasing number of older 
people.
During past decades, exercise training has been 
increasingly used in the treatment of chronic 
diseases and specialists have started to use the terms 
‘exercise therapy’ and ‘therapeutic exercise’. Exer-
cise therapy for chronic diseases can be broadly 
categorised as aerobic, resistance, combination of 
aerobic and resistance, or other condition-specific 
exercise-based training. Condition-specific exercise 
is used to target specific functional impairments; 
for instance, supervised walking training or balance 
training may be used to improve walking ability in 
patients with stroke. To measure functional capacity, 
either objective measures of performance, such as 
maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max), or patient-re-
ported measures, such as the SF-36 Physical Func-
tion Scale, may be used.8 Disability is evaluated 
using patient-reported measures and is determined 
as the degree of loss in functional capacity.4
Several meta-analyses have found exercise therapy 
improves functional capacity and reduces disability 
in individuals with chronic diseases,9 10 but due to 
the large number of randomised controlled trials 
(RCTs) and meta-analyses of RCTs, an umbrella 
summary of the results is necessary. Knowing in 
which conditions physical training should be added 
to therapy protocols is important for the patient and 
for the clinician’s decision making. Therefore, the 
purpose of this systematic review was to conduct 
an umbrella review11 of all meta-analyses of RCTs 
that have evaluated the effects of exercise therapy 
on the physical performance, functional capacity, or 
disabilities of patients with chronic non-communi-
cable diseases when compared with usual care. This 
systematic review design has been planned on the 
basis of previous reviews of the multidimensional 
effects of exercise therapy in different chronic 
diseases.12 13 This evidence-based knowledge is 
important for professionals in sports and exercise 
medicine and physiotherapy and for specialists in 
other fields to understand the important role of 
exercise therapy in healthcare.
METhODS
This updated review, based on the overview of 
reviews protocol by the Cochrane Collaboration,14 
focuses solely on the physical performance and 
functional capacity outcomes, which are theoreti-
cally the most direct and quickly achieved benefits 
of exercise therapy.

Review
Search strategy and selection criteria
A systematic search was conducted using the following 
bibliographic databases: CENTRAL (via OvidSP), CINAHL (via 
EBSCO), DARE (via OvidSP), Medline (via PubMed), OTSeeker, 
PEDro, SPORTDiscus (via EBSCO), ProQuest Nursing & Allied 
Health Database, Web of Science, Scopus, OpenGrey and BMC 
Proceedings from their inception to 1 September 2016. To 
retrieve additional articles, Google Scholar was used to search 
for relevant clinical guidelines and systematic reviews for more 
references, the reference lists of the included meta-analyses were 
screened manually and the personal archives of the authors 
were searched. Article language and publication status were 
not restricted. The search phrase consisted of MeSH terms and 
keywords related to exercise, meta-analysis and chronic disease 
(see online supplementary table 1).
Eligible articles were required to (1) be meta-analyses of RCTs, 
(2) have outcome measures related to physical performance, 
functional capacity or disability, (3) compare exercise therapy 
with no treatment or usual care, (4) have mostly adult partici-
pants, as defined by the Cochrane Collaboration14 and (5) have 
patients with any non-communicable chronic disease as defined 
by WHO.15 Meta-analyses were excluded if (1) they did not 
report the number of studies or participants, (2) they assessed 
postsurgical recovery or site-specific musculoskeletal conditions 
such as patellofemoral pain syndrome (although exercise therapy 
may be a standard treatment), (3) the exercise intervention was 
of very low intensity, for example, yoga, or (4) the meta-anal-
ysis had the same outcome as another meta-analysis assessing the 
same disease and intervention that was newer, higher quality as 
assessed with AMSTAR checklist16 or with a higher sample size.
Data analysis
Article screening, data extraction and quality assessment were 
carried out by two authors independently (TP
, ST). Discrepancies 
were resolved by discussion or by consulting the senior authors 
(AH, UMK). First, the titles and abstracts were screened, then 
the full-text articles were retrieved and evaluated against the 
inclusion criteria. Articles that were not available were requested 
from the authors. Then, outcome data at the end of the interven-
tion, intervention characteristics, publication bias assessments 
and adverse effects were extracted. Finally, the quality of each 
included meta-analysis was evaluated using the AMSTAR check-
list.16 For results that were not presented as standardised mean 
difference (SMD) in the original meta-analysis, the Cochrane 
Collaboration’s Review Manager V
.5.3 was used to convert the 
outcomes to SMD to allow visual comparison of the results in a 
forest plot. If data were insufficient for conversion, data were 
extracted from original RCTs and processed as instructed by the 
Cochrane Collaboration.14
The meta-analyses were classified according to the type of 
exercise therapy into four categories:
1. Aerobic exercise
2. Resistance training
3. Aerobic and resistance training combined
4. Other condition-specific exercise-based training
For each exercise category, the data were analysed qualita-
tively based on the SMDs of each included outcome. The SMDs 
were evaluated using forest plot figures as well as proportions 
of significant results and proportions of small (SMD <0.5), 
moderate (SMD 0.5–0.8) and large (SMD >0.8) effect sizes.17 
The significance of the results (p<0.05) was judged based on 
the 95% CIs of the SMDs. In addition to this primary anal-
ysis, the results were evaluated qualitatively based on the mean 
differences (MDs). We did not include meta-analyses with less 
than three studies or less than 100 participants in the main anal-
ysis. We tested if these meta-analyses would have changed the 
results by performing a qualitative sensitivity analysis by adding 
the results of these meta-analyses in the figures and comparing 
the results visually.
RESulTS
The search process is presented in a flow diagram in figure 1. The 
systematic search retrieved a total of 11 947 articles and seven 
additional records were identified through the manual search. 
After removing duplicates, 10 425 articles remained; of these, 
10 108 articles were excluded based on their titles and abstracts. 
The remaining 317 articles were retrieved as full-text versions. 
Of these articles, 233 were excluded (see online supplementary 
table 2) and finally, 84 meta-analyses were included in the quali-
tative synthesis. Of these, 13 meta-analyses were excluded from 
the report figures (see online supplementary table 3). Our search 
strategy resulted in the inclusion of meta-analyses with the 
following chronic diseases: Alzheimer’s disease, cancer, chronic 
fatigue syndrome, chronic heart failure, chronic kidney disease, 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cognitive impairment, 
coronary heart disease, dementia, fibromyalgia, haematological 
malignancies, heart failure, interstitial lung disease, multiple 
sclerosis, osteoarthritis, Parkinson’s disease, peripheral arterial 
disease (intermittent claudication), rheumatoid arthritis, stroke 
and type 2 diabetes.
Meta-analysis quality
The AMSTAR Score ranged from 1 to 11 out of 11 with a 
median of 6 which indicates moderate overall methodological 
quality (see online supplementary table 4). A quarter (21 of the 
85 included meta-analyses) assessed publication bias. Eleven 
of 147 (7%) outcomes were reported to have publication bias, 
although it was minimal in almost all cases. The outcomes with 
potential publication bias are indicated in figures 2–5.
Aerobic exercise interventions
Thirteen meta-analyses with aerobic exercise interventions,18–30 
were included in the qualitative synthesis, and two eligible 
meta-analyses31 32 were excluded from the figures as they were 
older, lower quality or had a lower sample size than other 
meta-analyses with the same disease and outcome. Participant 
characteristics for the meta-analyses are presented in online 
supplementary table 5. The meta-analyses included land-based 
exercise only, water-based exercise only or both. Land-based 
exercise included walking, cycling, circuit training, and sports 
such as basketball and soccer. There was considerable hetero-
geneity in the interventions included in the meta-analyses. The 
length of interventions ranged from 2 weeks to 104 weeks. The 
exercise frequency was 1–10 times per week, the duration was 
10–180 
min per session, and the intensity was 27%–95% of 
maximum heart rate (for detailed intervention characteristics, 
see online supplementary tables 6–10). The exercise interven-
tions resulted in statistically significant improvements for 28 
of 31 (90%) outcomes, compared with the control group (see 
figure 2). The SMDs were small, moderate and large in 45%, 
45% and 10% of the outcomes, respectively. For results as MD, 
see online supplementary table 11. Results were similar regard-
less of whether objective or patient self-reported measures of 
functional capacity were used.

Review
Resistance training interventions
Eleven 
meta-analyses 
with 
resistance 
training 
interven-
tions,30 33–42 were included in the qualitative synthesis and two 
eligible meta-analyses43 44 were excluded from the figures. The 
length of the interventions ranged from 2 weeks to 104 weeks. 
The exercise frequency was two to seven times per week, the 
duration was 6–90 
min per session, and the volume and repetition 
range were one to four sets per exercise and 5 to 30 repetitions 
per set, respectively. The equipment used varied from traditional 
free weights to therapeutic tools, such as an isokinetic dynamom-
eter. The exercise interventions resulted in statistically significant 
improvements for 17 of 19 (89%) outcomes, compared with 
the control group (see figure 3). The SMDs were small, moderate 
and large in 42%, 37% and 21% of the outcomes, respectively.

Review
Combined aerobic and resistance training interventions
Thirty-two meta-analyses with combined aerobic and resistance 
training interventions30 45–75 were included in the qualitative 
synthesis and nine eligible meta-analyses28 76–83 were excluded 
from the figures. The length of the interventions ranged from 2 
weeks to 112 weeks. The characteristics of interventions were 
similar to those in the separate aerobic or resistance training 
interventions. The exercise interventions resulted in statisti-
cally significant improvements for 54 of 60 (90%) outcomes, 
compared with the control group (see figure 4). The SMDs 
were small, moderate and large in 40%, 42% and 18% of the 
outcomes, respectively.
Condition-specific exercise
T
wenty 
meta-analyses 
with 
condition-specific 
interven-
tions26 41 84–101 were included in the qualitative synthesis and 
two meta-analyses102 103 were excluded from the figures. Condi-
tion-specific exercise was conducted both individually and in 
groups. The interventions included, for example, supervised 
walking therapy and specific physical rehabilitation approaches 
such as dual-task walking, transfer practice, specific aerobic 
exercises and resistance training. In most studies, the exercise 
was supervised by physiotherapists or occupational therapists. 
The length of interventions ranged from 2 weeks to 104 weeks. 
The exercise frequency was 1–14 times per week for 10–300 
min 
per session. In the few meta-analyses that reported exercise 
intensity, it was low to moderate. The exercise interventions 
resulted in statistically significant improvements for 27 of 36 
(75%) outcomes (see figure 5). The SMDs were small, moderate 
and large in 47%, 25% and 28% of the outcomes, respectively.
Sensitivity analysis
To test if meta-analyses with less than three studies or less than 
100 participants would have changed the results of this study 
we added the results of these meta-analyses in the figures to 
see if they changed the results. The results appeared to be in 
agreement with larger meta-analyses (the mean indicated a low 
to moderate positive effect), however, due to the very wide CIs, 
the results could not be interpreted reliably. That is, the often 
non-significant effects were probably not caused by inefficiency 
of exercise therapy but rather by the small sample size.
Safety
None of the meta-analyses reported a statistically significant 
difference in adverse effects, deaths or hospitalisations between 
the exercise and control groups. Information about the adverse 
effects was available in 64 of 85 (75%) meta-analyses; although, 
most of the meta-analyses reported insufficient reporting of 
adverse effects in the original RCTs. The adverse effects expe-
rienced by control and intervention group participants ranged 
from increased pain to myocardial infarction (see online supple-
mentary table 12).
DISCuSSIOn
The main finding of this umbrella review was that exercise 
therapy can improve physical performance and functional 
capacity in all of the included non-communicable chronic 
diseases. In approximately half of the physical performance 
and functional capacity outcomes, the effect of exercise was 
moderate or large. Therefore, the improvements are likely to 
be clinically important through reduction of functional capacity 
limitations in everyday activities. Although adverse effects were 
not consistently reported, based on the available data, exercise 
therapy appears to be safe in all of the included chronic diseases. 
The results appear to be similar for all training types, regard-
less of whether the studies used objective or patient-reported 
outcomes. However, condition-specific programmes had a lower 
proportion of significant results compared with aerobic exercise, 
strength training and combined aerobic and strength training. 
The finding that physical performance and functional capacity 
are improved by exercise therapy, is in agreement with the 
meta-analyses that were excluded from the qualitative synthesis 
as well as meta-analyses where multiple chronic diseases had 
been combined.9 10
Validity of the results
At the time of writing this overview, there were 13 meta-analysis 
protocols that would have fulfilled the inclusion criteria for this 
overview in the PROSPERO International Prospective Register 
of Systematic Reviews. It appears unlikely that future meta-anal-
yses would change the overall conclusion of this overview, 
however, future research will likely increase our disease-specific 
knowledge on many specific aspects of exercise therapy. It is

also unlikely that expanding this overview to include systematic 
reviews without meta-analysis would change the results consid-
erably as the vast majority of systematic reviews appear to be in 
agreement with these results.104
Generalisability of the results
The results of this review are applicable to adult patients with 
any one of the included chronic diseases. As it is possible that 
meta-analyses have not been conducted or only a few RCTs are 
available for some chronic diseases for which exercise therapy 
might not be effective, our results cannot be directly generalised 
to chronic diseases that were not included in this review. Our 
review covers most non-communicable chronic diseases with 
high prevalence in the general population. For cancer, the results 
can be generalised mostly to cancer survivors after aggressive 
cancer treatments.
Impact of exercise therapy
Perhaps one of the most important impacts of improved func-
tional capacity is improved coping with activities of daily 
living. This may also contribute to reduced experience of 
pain and disease progression, as well as psychological bene-
fits.105 Improved functional capacity of elderly patients has 
important economic benefits due to reduced need of care and 
the ability to live at home. The results of this study are in line 
with a recent RCT showing that a structured physical activity 
programme reduced mobility disability among older, at-risk 
adults.106 Increasing functional capacity and functional reserve

Review
are important components of maintaining unrestricted mobility, 
independence and a high quality of life; therefore, paying atten-
tion to the patients’ functional capacity should be a routine part 
of each medical examination.
Disease-specific considerations
Due to the scope of this overview we have not focused in detail 
on disease-specific results. Furthermore, detailed comparisons 
on how well individuals with different chronic diseases respond 
to exercise based on this overview might not be reliable as the 
methods used in the original RCTs and meta-analyses vary 
considerably. The differences in the results for different chronic 
diseases could be caused by a multitude of confounding factors 
that we have not systematically appraised in this overview, such 
as the quality and duration of the exercise programme design, 
supervision, adherence and disease severity. However, it is 
important to keep in mind that different diseases cause different 
types of functional impairments and exercise programmes 
should be designed to target those impairments. Improving 
aerobic performance while influencing cardiometabolic risk 
factors is important in diseases such as type 2 diabetes and coro-
nary heart disease; however, training specific muscle groups may 
be necessary when improving the functional capacity of patients 
with specific musculoskeletal problems. Our results concerning 
the types of training used in patients with different diseases 
reflect these disease-specific needs. Comparing the effect sizes 
of different types of exercise on different outcomes would not 
be valid using this study design, but different types of training 
programmes (aerobic, strength and both combined) appear to 
give the specific desirable benefits consistently. There was a good 
match between the objective measurements and self-reported 
functional benefits. The lower proportion of significant positive 
effects due to condition-specific exercise may be related to the 
more severe functional limitations among certain patient groups, 
such as those with Parkinson’s disease or those with severe 
(preoperative) osteoarthritis. Moreover, usual care also included 
physical training components, for example, in the treatment of 
patients with stroke. So, the condition-specific programmes in 
our classification are often carried out in situations where the 
disease sets limitations to training and recovery.
Implications for practice
When applying the results of this umbrella review in clinical 
practice, consider that the patients usually did not have comor-
bidities in the original RCTs. In addition, in the scientific trials 
the inclusion and exclusion criteria are usually carefully planned 
and followed, and the training programmes are tailored and 
guided according to the disease type and severity, which may 
have reduced the number of complications.13 In clinical work 
disease-specific functional and mobility limitations should be 
considered and identified as early as possible, to prevent them 
from worsening. Also, the type of exercise therapy programme 
should be selected to best correct the disease-specific functional 
problems. The supplementary tables with the exercise interven-
tion characteristics and the included meta-analyses may be used 
as a basis for designing exercise programmes for different chronic 
diseases. Usually the training programme should be progressive 
and include follow-ups to document the adherence, effectiveness

What are the new findings?
 
► Our umbrella review of meta-analyses shows that aerobic, 
resistance, and the combination of aerobic and resistance 
training have beneficial effects on objective and self-
reported measures of functional capacity in patients with 
non-communicable chronic diseases.
 
► Exercise therapy appears to be safe for patients with 
non-communicable chronic diseases.
how might it impact on clinical practice in the future?
Exercise therapy should be recommended for all patients with 
non-communicable chronic diseases to prevent the decline of 
functional capacity and to improve it further.
Review
and possible adverse effects. It is a challenge for the healthcare 
system and its professionals to address these issues in real clin-
ical situations. A recent study reported that among adults with 
disabilities who had visited a health professional within the past 
12 months, 56% of did not receive a recommendation for phys-
ical activity.107
Recommendations for future research
The development of reporting guidelines for adverse effects is 
warranted, as there appears to be a serious lack of consistency 
in reporting in the RCTs included in the meta-analyses. More-
over, very few meta-analyses fulfilled the 11th criteria in the 
AMSTAR checklist: ‘was the conflict of interest included?’ We 
also encourage development and inclusion of proper cost-ben-
efit analyses in future exercise therapy studies, since the current 
trials usually do not provide adequate data for such analyses. 
These studies should include both disease-specific and general 
outcome measures and collaboration with cross-sector partners. 
Moreover, currently there seems to be great variation in the 
exercise programme designs and lengths of interventions, which 
indicates that meta-regression and network meta-analyses are 
needed to find out the most optimal ways to improve functional 
capacity in different chronic diseases. Finally, although we used 
WHO’s ICF framework’s definition of disability, the patient-re-
ported outcome measures used in the included meta-analyses to 
describe disability may not have been developed using ICF as 
a guiding framework. Evaluating how these outcome measures 
fit with the ICF framework, could be another focus for future 
research.
Strengths and limitations
The main strength of our umbrella review was that we only 
included meta-analyses with RCTs. Moreover, the likelihood of 
retrieving all relevant articles was maximised by using a highly 
sensitive search strategy. However, there were some limitations 
to our study. First, we did not publish a protocol for this study. 
Nonetheless, to our knowledge, this would not have changed 
the way the study was conducted, although, it might have made 
us exclude very low intensity exercise protocols from the review 
earlier. Another limitation was low methodological quality 
in some meta-analyses. Nevertheless, the results of the lower 
quality meta-analyses seemed to be in line with those with higher 
AMSTAR scores. It is possible that many of the lower scores 
also reflect poor reporting standards rather than poor meth-
odological quality. The effect of publication bias on the results 
remains unclear, as publication bias was statistically analysed for 
only a third of the outcomes. However, in almost all instances, 
it was reported to be minimal. Therefore, it likely does not have 
a large impact on the vast majority of results. The quality of the 
presented evidence is unclear as the GRADE quality evaluation108 
was available for only approximately a tenth of the outcomes. 
For these outcomes, the ratings ranged from low to high. When 
including several meta-analyses, it is possible for a single study to 
be included in more than one meta-analysis. However, since we 
did not include overlapping meta-analyses on the same outcome 
and the same chronic disease, this was unlikely in this overview.
Deviations from the unpublished protocol
We included yoga and taiji in the search strategy as we had 
preplanned to include these interventions in the review. 
However, after conducting the search, we decided to exclude 
these forms of exercise with very low or unclear intensity as 
meta-analyses did not appear to distinguish the results between 
less intensive and more intensive variants of these types of exer-
cise. Without additional information regarding the intensity of 
exercise, interpretation of the results from the figures could have 
been challenging. Yoga and taiji may also have effects via other 
mechanisms than exercise itself.
COnCluSIOn
Exercise therapy appears to be a safe way to improve physical 
performance and functional capacity, and reduce disability in 
individuals with non-communicable chronic disease. This applies 
to aerobic exercise, resistance training, combined aerobic and 
resistance training, and to most of the other condition-specific 
training protocols.

What is already known?
 
► Worldwide chronic diseases reduce the functional capacity 
and quality of life of more than a billion individuals.
 
► Meta-analyses suggest that exercise therapy improves 
functional capacity and reduces disability in individuals with 
different chronic diseases, but due to the large number of 
randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses of 
RCTs, it is challenging for clinicians to summarise the results.
