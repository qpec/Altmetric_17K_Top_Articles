 Equivalence between solar irradiance 
and solar simulators in aging tests of sunglasses
Mauro Masili and Liliane Ventura* 
Background
Ocular health is a serious concern worldwide, but particularly in tropical countries where 
UV indexes are extremely high in summer and still very high in the winter compared to 
countries that are farther apart from the tropics. In most countries in the southern hem-
isphere, and specifically in Brazil, a continental sized tropical country, sunglasses stand-
ards are not quite appropriate for the ultraviolet conditions, as well as for the people’s 
behavior profile about UV protection, and public should be more aware about ultraviolet 
Abstract 
Background: This work is part of a broader research that focuses on ocular health. 
Three outlines are the basis of the pyramid that comprehend the research as a whole: 
authors’ previous work, which has provided the public to self-check their own sun-
glasses regarding the ultraviolet protection compatible to their category; Brazilian 
national survey in order to improve nationalization of sunglasses standards; and studies 
conducted on revisiting requirements of worldwide sunglasses standards, in which 
this work is inserted. It is still controversial on the literature the ultraviolet (UV) radia-
tion effects on the ocular media, but the World Health Organization has established 
safe limits on the exposure of eyes to UV radiation based on the studies reported in 
literature. Sunglasses play an important role in providing safety, and their lenses should 
provide adequate UV filters. Regarding UV protection for ocular media, the resistance-
to-irradiance test for sunglasses under many national standards requires irradiating 
lenses for 50 uninterrupted hours with a 450 W solar simulator. This artificial aging test 
may provide a corresponding evaluation of exposure to the sun.
Methods: Calculating the direct and diffuse solar irradiance at a vertical surface and 
the corresponding radiant exposure for the entire year, we compare the latter with the 
50-h radiant exposure of a 450 W xenon arc lamp from a solar simulator required by 
national standards.
Results: Our calculations indicate that this stress test is ineffective in its present form.
Conclusions: We provide evidence of the need to re-evaluate the parameters of the 
tests to establish appropriate safe limits for UV irradiance.
Significance: This work is potentially significant for scientists and legislators in the 
field of sunglasses standards to improve the requirements of sunglasses quality and 
safety.

protection as a whole. The authors of this work have been conducting researches in 
order to bridge these gaps. Three outlines are the basis of the pyramid that comprehends 
the research as a whole: (1) authors’ previous work [1], which has provided the public to 
self-check their own sunglasses regarding the ultraviolet protection compatible to their 
category. This has allowed population to self-test their own sunglasses for free and in an 
easy way to find out in 30 s whether their sunglasses are adequate or inappropriate to 
be worn by the Brazilian standard limits; (2) Brazilian national survey [2] has improved 
information such as how many daily hours Brazilians wear sunglasses, in which period 
of the day and season, in which are the environments most popularly worn, what kind of 
sunglasses are mostly purchased, and so forth. This information provides parameters for 
nationalization of sunglasses standards, such as how long sunglasses should last in such 
community; (3) studies conducted on revisiting requirements of worldwide sunglasses 
standards, such as the UV protection range extended to 400 nm in 2013 in Brazil as part 
of our researches. This work is a continuation of these researches.
According to the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection 
(ICNIRP), ultraviolet (UV) radiation constitutes the portion of the electromagnetic 
spectrum spanning from 100 to 400 nm [3]. The International Commission on Illumina-
tion (CIE—Commission Internationale de l’Eclairage) [4, 5] subsequently split the UV 
spectrum into three important spectral bands with respect to the effects of UV radia-
tion on biological systems. These bands are widely known as UV-C (100–280 nm), UV-B 
(280–315 nm), and UV-A (315–380 nm or 400 nm, depending on the standard).
Investigations on UV radiation incident upon the eyes have noted pathological modifi-
cations to the cornea and to the internal structures of the eye [6, 7]. The possible effects 
include edema, pterygium, lens opacity (cataract), and retina damage [8, 9].
It is well known that sunglasses should provide filters for protection against UV radia-
tion. National and regional standards [10–14] for the sunglasses industry require that 
sunglasses provide levels of protection linked to the luminous transmittance, i.e., on the 
category of lenses. The Australian/New Zealand standard [11], the first one for general 
use sunglasses, set a UV wavelength range from 280 to 400 nm. The 2013 version of Bra-
zilian standard extended the upper limit of the UV-A range from 380 to 400 nm, becom-
ing more consistent with the Australian/New Zealand standard [11], as Brazil, Australia, 
and New Zealand share greater risk of a higher UV dose [15]. However, the current Bra-
zilian standard, NBR ISO 12312-1:2015 [10], which replaced the NBR 15111:2013, has 
returned the UV-A upper limit to 380 nm. In a recent work [2], the authors emphasized 
the importance of considering the UV-A limit of 400 nm for UV-protecting filters based 
on the radiant exposure (in J m−2) on the eye’s surface.
It is also important to understand the lifetime of the optical properties of sunglasses. 
The exposure of sunglasses to the sun may deteriorate their UV protection and alter the 
category under which they are classified (lenses may become lighter when overexposed 
to the sun) over time. Moreover, Chou, Dain, and, Cheng [16] recently showed that 
transmittance is not the only factor effected by UV radiation exposure. They showed 
that exposure of lenses to high levels of UV radiation diminishes the impact resistance of 
lenses. Thus, it should be a requirement that both the transmittance and the impact tests 
should be performed subsequently to the aging test of the lenses.

Aging tests of sunglasses lenses
One of the requirements of the Brazilian standard NBR ISO 12312-1:2015 and other 
standards is to perform a test in which sunglasses are irradiated by a solar simulator for 
a specified period. The UV protection provided by the sunglasses prior to exposure to 
UV radiation is then compared to their UV protection capabilities following exposure 
in the solar simulator. This test provides a measure of any change in the UV protection 
as a result of exposure of the sunglasses to the sun. The procedure is referred to as the 
resistance-to-solar-irradiation test or the simply artificial aging test. It consists of irradi-
ating the lenses of sunglasses with an ozone-free xenon arc lamp (450 W) using a cutoff 
filter (clear white crown glass B 270; 4 mm thick) between the lamp and the lenses under 
test, which are placed 300 mm away from the lamp. The lenses are subjected to artificial 
solar irradiation by the solar simulator for 50 ± 0.1 h [10, 12]. Following the exposure to 
radiation, spectrophotometry is performed to determine the sunglasses’ transmittance 
of radiation in the UV-A and UV-B ranges; then, these measurements are compared 
with the values found before the resistance-to-irradiation test. Thus, the extent to which 
the UV filters are deteriorated during the aging process can be estimated.
The aim of this test is to establish a correlation between the periods of exposure to 
natural and simulated sunlight required by many standards for sunglasses. Furthermore, 
typical periods of exposure are considered based on data obtained from a national sur-
vey [2] in Brazil. This correlation varies among different countries and even among dif-
ferent locations within the same country, such as in Brazil. Attempts to match artificial 
aging tests with environmental counterparts have been problematic in many areas [17–
20]. To the best of our knowledge, this is a pioneering effort to achieve such equivalence, 
at least for sunglasses standards.
Therefore, the objective of whole project is to establish the equivalence between solar 
exposure during use of the sunglasses and the solar simulator parameters used to carry 
out the resistance-to-solar irradiation test. Hence, the goal is to provide additional infor-
mation regarding the parameters used in the UV testing of solar lenses to contribute to 
the further optimization of the Brazilian standard. Other national standards may also 
benefit from the present work, especially those nations that are located at similar abso-
lute latitudes.
Methods
The task of determining the global irradiance on the earth’s surface involves calcula-
tions of direct and diffuse solar irradiance. The geometry taken into account in this work 
refers to an individual who is standing up and wearing sunglasses. In this case, the direct 
beam irradiance is incident upon a vertical (plane) surface, with a well-known depend-
ence on the incident angle with the normal direction to the surface, described by Lam-
bert’s cosine law. The diffuse irradiance refers to the radiation scattered from the clouds 
and the atmosphere as well as from the ground and its surroundings.
The starting point in this calculation is to determine the spectral irradiance (in 
W m−2 nm−1), called E(λ, r, t), at site level, where λ is the wavelength, r collectively rep-
resents all spatial coordinates, i.e., geographical position and altitude, and t is time of 
day. For this calculation, we use the SMARTS2 spectral model, proposed by Gueymard 
[21], which is free to download. The accuracy of this model has been assessed in the 
 Page 4 of 13
Masili and Ventura  
BioMed Eng OnLine  (2016) 15:86 
literature [21, 22]. The model uses the extraterrestrial solar spectrum (based on satellite 
data) and through radiative transfer models of the atmosphere, the spectral irradiance is 
determined at ground level. The model is capable of calculating the direct and the diffuse 
radiation components for any plane orientation. Specifically, for a vertical plane orien-
tation, the cosine of the incident angle with the horizontal has to be included (oblique 
incidence). Alternatively, the sine of the zenith angle of solar rays may be used. The sum 
of the two components is the global irradiance. Thus, the global spectral irradiance can 
be expressed in the following form:
where indexes b and d represent direct and diffuse, respectively, and θz(r, t) is the zenith 
angle of the solar beams.
Integration over the appropriate wavelength range yields the solar irradiance E(r, t) (in 
W∙m−2) in terms of the spectral irradiance E(λ, r, t) [Eq. (1)], as follows:
Therefore, the radiant exposure (in J·m−2) on a surface over a given period is calcu-
lated by integrating the irradiance E(r,t) over time, i.e.,
To establish the equivalence between solar radiant exposure (3) and the radiant expo-
sure emitted by a simulator lamp, we calculate the radiant exposure from the lamp using 
the above-mentioned equations, using the lamp’s spectral irradiance provided by the 
manufacturer instead of the solar spectral irradiance. Hence, the solar radiant exposure 
can be compared with the lamp’s radiant exposure.
The fundamental idea is to compute the lamp’s radiant exposure [Eq. (3)] incident on 
the lenses within the simulator and the sun’s radiant exposure, both in the region 280–
492 nm, and compare them with each other. When calculating the lamp’s radiant expo-
sure, one must consider the distance of the samples from the bulb. On the other hand, 
for the sun’s radiant exposure, the calculation is more difficult due to many variables to 
be considered. Evidently, the solar irradiance changes during the day and throughout the 
year at each location, and it is primarily latitude dependent. Thus, we formulate three 
specific situations for solar irradiance to model, which are quite representative of the con-
ditions that sunglasses are submitted to, as they are worn by an individual throughout a 
year. In each situation, a different amount of daily hours for wearing sunglasses is con-
sidered. Therefore, a daily average of the solar radiant exposure is obtained for each sce-
nario and compared with the lamp’s radiant exposure. The ratio between both expresses 
a lamp–sun equivalence in “days of use” for each scenario. In other words, for instance, 
1 h of exposure in the solar simulator is equivalent to different amount of exposure hours 
under different solar irradiance conditions, such as the scenarios previously described.
A variety of assumptions, pertaining to both the solar simulator setup and the outdoor 
environment, can be taken into account to determine this equivalence relation. Those

assumptions will be presented and discussed in the following section. In all of that, the 
oblique incidence (cosine corrected) will be accounted for.
Results and discussion
Calculations were carried out for the 27 Brazilian state capitals, which span all over the 
country, and for the specific town of São Paulo, São Paulo State, Brazil, which is a rep-
resentative example for our purposes. São Paulo is the largest city in Brazil, with nearly 
12 million inhabitants, located at latitude −23°32′
51″
 S, longitude −46°38′
10″
 W at an 
average altitude of 760 m. For the northern hemisphere readers, this latitude is approxi-
mately equivalent to the latitude of Havana, Cuba. The latitudes of the 27 Brazilian state 
capitals range from +2°49′
11″
 N down to −30°01′
59″
 S. Although our main calcula-
tions are performed for Brazilian cities, in fact, other southern hemisphere countries, 
which share same latitudes, would benefit from our results once those calculations are 
latitude driven. We also present results for 110 Northern Hemisphere national capitals 
once many of them are at higher latitudes than nations in Southern Hemisphere. The 
SMARTS2 model herein used [21], aside information about site location, date, and time, 
requires input parameters to characterize the atmosphere, such as ozone column, aero-
sols, turbidity, and others. In addition, it is also possible to input parameters which char-
acterize the local environment, such as soil reflectance. Regarding the atmosphere, for 
Brazilian cities calculations we have selected the SMARTS2 built-in Tropical standard 
atmosphere, which has average typical gas concentrations and no pollutants. Likewise, 
for northern national capitals, we used the SMARTS2 built-in Mid Latitude standard 
atmosphere. In both cases, the local environment was mainly assumed as urban area 
with concrete soil. A clear sky assumption has also been made.
Spectral irradiance data corresponding to a distance of 500 mm from the lamp’s 
bulb (XBO450–OFR xenon arc lamp) were provided by OSRAM over the range 280–
2400 nm. Although values of the solar spectral irradiance are available up to a wave-
length of 4000 nm, all calculations were carried out over the range 280–492 nm, both 
for sun and lamp spectral irradiances [see integration limits in Eq. (2)]. The reason for 
this choice is that this is the range of the fading action spectra, which is primarily in the 
UV region and, to a lesser extent, in the blue region, corresponding to short wavelength 
radiation. Moreover, it plays an important role for the ocular health.
The standardized solar irradiance for air mass 1 (AM1) is 1000 W m−2, which is 
expressed as 1 sun. This is the approximate solar irradiance at the Earth’s surface on a 
horizontal plane at sea level on a clear day, with sun at zenith. Table 1 presents the cal-
culated irradiance of the XBO450–OFR xenon arc lamp from OSRAM for several dis-
tances from the lamp bulb for orthogonal irradiation. The sun-equivalent irradiance 
was calculated as the ratio between the lamp’s irradiance and the standardized solar 
irradiance (1000 W m−2) at each desired distance. The lamp’s spectral irradiance was 
derived for the desired distances using the inverse square law for point-like light sources. 
Because the xenon arc length in this lamp is 2.7 mm, according to the manufacturer, 
a distance from the arc equivalent to five times its largest dimension provides a devia-
tion of 1 % from the inverse square law [23]. In Table 1, the minimum distance from the 
tested lenses to the lamp used for calculations is 50 mm. For this particular distance, 
or shorter distances, the extension of the lenses to be irradiated should be taken into

account, once the light incidence at the edges of the lenses is not orthogonal. Never-
theless, the standard requires transmittance measurements in a circle of 5 mm radius, 
centered on the optical axis of the lenses. This requirement ensures a nearly normal inci-
dence in the region of interest, with a maximum deviation of order of 6 % from normal 
incidence. Therefore, for every distance longer than 50 mm from the bulb, the inverse 
square law remains valid.
It is worth noting that when sunglasses are irradiated 300 mm away from the lamp’s 
bulb, as required by the standards NBR ISO 12312-1:2015 [10, 11], EN ISO 12312-1:2015 
[12], and ISO 12312-1 [13], the equivalent sun irradiance is 0.5, as listed in the first row 
of Table 1. In other words, the irradiance is similar to that observed when sunglasses 
are orthogonally exposed to 50 % of the solar irradiance at AM1. The remaining data 
in Table 1 present the equivalent lamp–sun irradiance values for decreasing distances 
between the sunglasses and the lamp. Because the inverse square law was used to con-
vert the lamp’s irradiance at 500 mm to that at a desired distance, it should be noted that 
when the distance is halved, the irradiance is quadrupled. To achieve an exact match 
between the lamp’s irradiance and one equivalent sun at AM1, the distance from the 
bulb should be 205 mm.
Brazilian standard [10] and Australian/New Zealand standard [11] require that sun-
glasses should be irradiated for 50 uninterrupted hours at a distance of 300 mm from 
the lamp’s bulb in the resistance-to-radiation test. Reasons for that particular distance 
and period seem unclear and likely lost in history. Under these conditions, according to 
Table 1, 1 h of lamp exposure is equivalent to 0.5 h of orthogonal sun exposure at AM1, 
i.e., this simulation system is equivalent to 0.5 sun. Therefore, irradiating sunglasses for 
50 h under a simulator should be equivalent to exposing the sunglasses to the sun for 
25 h at AM1. This result is not realistic because the atmospheric path of solar beams var-
ies with solar displacement. In addition, it should be considered that when an individual 
wears sunglasses, the lenses are not orthogonally exposed to the sun because they are 
usually worn in the vertical position, in which the lenses are not orthogonal to the sun’s 
rays. Therefore, the incidence angles of solar rays with respect to the sunglasses lenses 
are relevant, and the sun’s elevation should thus be taken into account, i.e., one should 
account for oblique incidence.
Some researchers have shown the personal effects of outdoor solar exposure [24, 25] 
addressing the dermatological aspects.

In this sense, concerns regarding solar exposure are pertinent and the effectiveness of 
solar simulation on the standards and its parameters are relevant. In order to establish 
the correspondence of solar simulator and natural sun exposure on sunglasses worn by 
an individual, some pertinent considerations, named boundary conditions are required.
On authors’ public on-going web survey, 55,000 people have already answered the 
questions and as a result, most users in Brazil wears sunglasses for at least 2–4 h a day, 
and purchase new ones every 2 years.
Therefore, three possible scenarios are reasonable to be explored to set a corre-
spondence of sun simulation on sunglasses and natural sun exposure with boundary 
conditions.
In a recent publication [2], the authors showed that the profile of solar irradiance on 
vertical surfaces has two distinctive peaks, which indicate the highest irradiances at a 
given time of day. One of the peaks refers to the time equivalent to the middle of the 
morning period (average of 143 min after sunrises); the second peak refers to the middle 
of the afternoon period (average of 143 min before sunsets). Using the established irradi-
ance profiles, three scenarios of solar exposure were analyzed: (1) Sunglasses exposed 
to the sun over the period spanning from 30 min before the first peak (sunrise in the 
morning) to 30 min after the second peak, before sunset. The precise time at which each 
peak occurs shifts throughout the year, and this drift is accounted for. Hence, for each 
day, the period of exposure to the sun is different. For our purposes, the exposure period 
is called photoperiod; (2) The photoperiod spanning from sunrise to sunset. This range 
corresponds to the maximum possible irradiation from the sun and is included herein 
for comparison purposes; This second scenario, apparently unreal, is quite important for 
outdoor workers, especially in tropical countries, where a large part of the population is 
outdoor worker. (3) The 60 min of exposure time centered at the morning peak.
We note that in the three scenarios considered in this work, sunglasses were assumed 
to be worn in the upright position, tracking the position of the sun and accounting for 
the oblique incidence. One may argue that, on a daily basis, although the assumption of 
a vertical position is accurate, the tracking of the sun may be not. The latter assumption 
can be relaxed by assuming a random vertical positioning of the sunglasses. In this case, 
the sunglasses are, on average, facing the sun for half of the wearing period, and in the 
other half, they are worn with the lenses directed away from the sun. Hence, the incident 
radiant exposure onto the sunglasses is 50 % of the previously calculated amount. Thus, 
our proposed times for the stress test could be halved.
Also, actual human exposure conditions can be less than our worst-case assumptions, 
but reduction of UV by automotive windscreens, shading, etc. are not experienced by 
many who only wear their sunglasses in open environments, e.g., beachgoers, lifeguards, 
farmers, and most outdoor workers.
Aging test
For lenses irradiated for 50 h at a distance of 300 mm from the lamp during the aging 
test, the accumulated radiant exposure [Eq. (3)] delivered by the lamp to the lenses is 
7.8 MJ m−2.
Comparisons of the lamp’s radiant exposure with the sun’s radiant exposure in the 
three chosen scenarios were made based on these conditions. In this work, the authors 
 Page 8 of 13
Masili and Ventura  
BioMed Eng OnLine  (2016) 15:86 
also considered that the sunglasses faced the sun, vertically (with the sunglasses posi-
tioned on the face of an individual), for the entire period. For each scenario, we selected 
a southern summer day (day 355) and a winter day (day 172) to compare the radiant 
exposure levels. Obviously, those seasons are reversed for Northern Hemisphere. The 
chosen days represent the solstices, i.e., the year’s longest and shortest photoperiods, 
because similar to the reason for selecting a position in which sunglasses face the sun 
for the entire test period, these days provide the most extreme conditions. In addition, 
the sun’s daily average radiant exposure is herein presented. The daily average was cal-
culated by summing the solar radiant exposure over the entire year and dividing it by 
365.25 days. Last column of Table 2 presents the results of the lamp–sun equivalence 
for each scenario, in which the lamp–sunglasses distance is 300 mm, as established by 
the standards. The equivalences in “days of use” presented in the last column of Table 2 
are determined by the ratio between the lamp’s radiant exposure (6th column) and the 
global solar radiant exposure (5th column), both italicized for clarity.
In the first scenario, sunglasses were exposed to solar radiation from half an hour 
before the first peak in the direct solar radiant exposure profile up to half an hour past 
the second peak for a particular day. In this scenario, the global solar radiant exposure, 
which is the sum of the direct and diffuse components, amounts to 3.7 MJ m−2 for day 
355 (southern summer day). Hence, the lamp’s radiant exposure (over a 50-h period), 
which sums to 7.8 MJ m−2, is two times greater than the solar radiant exposure of day 
355 (see second row in Table 2). Thus, the exposure time of 50 h in the simulator is 
equivalent to the exposure to sunlight for approximately 2 days of specific day 355. In this 
scenario, day 355 has 8.6 h (from peak to peak) of exposure time to sunlight. Therefore,

and the radiant exposure provided by the lamp over a 50-h period (distance between sun-
glasses and lamp is 300 mm) for 2 specific days of the year: the shortest (day 172) 
and longest (day 355) days

the national standard requirements for aging tests—in which lenses are exposed for 50 h 
to a 450 W lamp (XBO450–OFR) at a distance of 300 mm from the lamp bulb—appears 
to be inadequate for aging tests, at least with regard to the superficial radiant exposure 
equivalence between the exposure to the lamp and to the natural environment.
Even for a less severe scenario, such as exposure on a winter day (e.g., day 172, for 
southern hemisphere), the solar radiant exposure components that reach a vertical 
surface are 1.5 MJ m−2 (direct) and 0.5 MJ m−2 (diffuse), resulting in a global radiant 
exposure of 2.0 MJ m−2. Assuming the same testing conditions described previously, the 
lamp-exposure time (50 h) is equivalent to 4 days (the photoperiod for day 172 is 4.0 h). 
Once more, the requirements defined for the aging tests are not sufficient.
Calculations were performed for each day of the year to allow the results to be aver-
aged throughout the year, yielding a daily average. Table 2 summarizes the average 
results alongside the results for the particular days referenced above. The table also pre-
sents a comparison with results obtained for the entire photoperiod of each day, i.e., 
from sunrise to sunset.
Table 2 presents the central results of this work. It can be observed that the test for 
sunglasses’ resistance to radiation (and the aging process thereof) required by the stand-
ards only probes the deterioration of the UV protection of the lenses for quite a short 
period and is therefore insufficient to guarantee their safety in terms of eye protection. 
Thus, the solarization test is ineffective and has no practical value.
To overcome these limitations of the standard requirements, one may either increase 
the exposure time of the lenses to the lamp or decrease the distance of the lenses from 
the lamp. Increasing the exposure time is certainly possible, although doing so may 
increase the cost and certification time, eventually causing the procedure to become 
impractical. According to Table 1, decreasing the distance from the lamp may be a more 
effective alternative because of the inverse square law for point sources. For instance, 
setting the distance from the lamp to 50 mm yields the results presented in Table 3. As 
expected, a sixfold reduction in distance increases the lamp–sun equivalence to a fac-
tor of 36, compared with values presented in last column of Table 2. On the other hand, 
increasing the exposure times avoids the consequential temperature rise that may come 
from decreasing the distance. A third alternative would be to change the 450 W lamp 
to higher power lamp, e.g., a 1600 W lamp, which is commercially available. However, 
this would require a major evaluation of this requirement in the standards, especially the 
specifications of the simulator as a whole.
Based on informed estimates, it is quite reasonable to assume that the UV protection 
of sunglasses should be required to last at least 2 years (730.5 days) under the first sce-
nario considered in this work. To simulate such a case, simply decreasing the distance 
from the lamp in the stress tests is insufficient, and the exposure time must be increased. 
For instance, on third row in Table 3, at lamp-sunglasses distance of 50 mm, the lamp 
provides 280.3 MJ m−2 for the 50 h of simulation period. Under the assumptions of the 
first scenario, the solar radiant exposure is, in average, 3.2 MJ m−2 per day. Thus, the 
ratio lamp–sun is 88 days. Hence, to increase the lamp–sun equivalence from 88 days 
to 730.5 days (2 years), the total radiant exposure of the lamp should be increased by a 
factor of 8.3, i.e., from 280.3 MJ m−2 to 2326.5 M m−2. This means to increase the period

of the 450 W lamp simulator by the same factor, i.e., from 50 to 414.6 h of exposure, at a 
distance of 50 mm.
To simulate the unlikely scenario of an individual who wears sunglasses from sunrise 
to sunset (in São Paulo, Brazil), the lamp–sun equivalence should be increased even 
more, and the lamp-exposure time should be increased to 603.7 h.
Table 4 presents the calculated data for radiant exposure lamp–sun equivalence, in 
days, for decreasing distances between the lamp and tested sunglasses. The data were 
calculated for 27 state capitals in Brazil. For each scenario and particular distance, the 
minimum and maximum values are listed. The entries labeled MED in Table 4 are the 
median values among all 27 locations in Brazil for which the calculations were carried

out. Once the latitude distribution of all locations considered in this work is non uni-
form, the median was calculated instead of the average to avoid unintended deviations. 
As expected, the lamp–sun equivalences as functions of distance, shown in each row of 
Table 4, follow an inverse square law.
Evidently, a typical person wears sunglasses throughout the year over a period of less 
than 8–12 h a day on average (our survey [2] indicates an average of 2 h daily). In such 
cases, the user may wear his/her sunglasses over a longer season while retaining the 
UV protection of the lenses. Tables 2, 3 and 4 present results calculated for the third 
scenario, in which an individual wears sunglasses for a typical period of 1 h daily when 
this period is assumed to coincide with the maximum exposure to solar radiation. To 
simulate this case, the lamp-exposure time should be 67.3 h (at a distance of 50 mm) to 
ensure a protection lifetime of 2 years (730.5 days).
Based on the survey of the Brazilian population, most users wears the same pair of 
sunglasses for a minimum of 2 years and for a period of 2 h a day. Therefore, the standard 
must guarantee that sunglasses should be safe over this period. In this case, the solariza-
tion test should be performed for 134.6 h (at a distance of 50 mm). In this respect, our 
contribution is the refinement of the parameters required by current standards for solar 
simulator exposure.
In order to extend the scope of this work, Table 5 presents, similarly, the same results 
as Table 4 for 110 national capitals from Northern Hemisphere. It is worth noting that 
the results for the lamp–sun equivalences are very similar to the values from Brazil, with 
a slight difference in favor of Norther Hemisphere due to the higher latitudes in general. 
Nevertheless, the results indicates that the solarization test of sunglasses is inadequate 
even for countries in Northern Hemisphere.
As in Brazil the sun delivers 0.5 MJ m−2 a day, for the third scenario, in 24 months, it 
would be delivered an amount of 365.3 M m−2 (0.5 M m−2 × 730.5 days). Therefore, for 
implementing such requirement for the “resistance to radiation test” of the standards, an

appropriate solar simulator, which provides irradiance, should be architected in order to 
supply accelerated simulation of sun exposure. It should assemble adequate lamp power, 
exposure time, distance from the bulb and controlled temperature that the sample will 
be exposed to.
Conclusions
The present test parameters for exposing samples to a solar simulator, as specified by the 
Brazilian and many national standards, should be revisited to establish safe limits for UV 
filters of sunglasses. By changing the exposure time within the solar simulator and the 
distance of the samples from the lamp, respectively, to 67.3 h and 50 mm, sunglasses can 
be safe to wear for a period of 2 years for users who wear them for a maximum of 2 h a 
day. It is worth noting that the temperature inside a solar simulator should not exceed 
limits that deteriorate the optical properties of sunglasses. Thus, it has to be assured by 
further investigation that the temperature inside the solar simulator at this distance from 
the lamp does not reach inappropriate levels.
Our calculations were made to ensure the safety of sunglasses worn in Brazil, but are 
also valuable to countries that share same latitudes. Additionally, results for 110 national 
capitals in northern hemisphere were presented, broadening the reach of this effort to 
help establish safe limits for UV filters of sunglasses.
