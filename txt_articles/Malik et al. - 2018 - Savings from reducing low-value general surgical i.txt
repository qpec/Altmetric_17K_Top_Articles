Background: Finding opportunities for improving efficiency is important, given the pressure on national
health budgets. Identifying and reducing low-value interventions that deliver little benefit is key. A
systematic literature evaluation was done to identify low-value interventions in general surgery, with
further assessment of their cost.
Methods: A multiplatform method of identifying low value interventions was undertaken, including a
broad literature search, a targeted database search, and opportunistic sampling. The results were then
stratified by impact, assessing both frequency and cost.
Results: Seventy-one low-value general surgical procedures were identified, of which five were of high
frequency and high cost (highest impact), 22 were of high cost and low frequency, 23 were of low cost and
high frequency, and 21 were of low cost and low frequency (lowest impact). Highest impact interventions
included inguinal hernia repair in minimally symptomatic patients, inappropriate gastroscopy, interval
cholecystectomy, CT to diagnose appendicitis and routine endoscopy in those who had CT-confirmed
diverticulitis. Their estimated cost was €153 383 953.
Conclusion: Low-value services place a burden on health budgets. Stopping only five high-volume,
high-cost general surgical procedures could save the National Health Service €153 million per annum.

Introduction
An expected £30 billion (€34 billion; exchange rate 28
September 2017) funding gap is expected by 2020–2021
in the English National Health Service (NHS)1. This pro-
vides motivation to identify and reduce the use of health-
care interventions that deliver little benefit, and which
could be substituted with less costly alternatives without
affecting safety and quality of care. The goal is not to imple-
ment cost-cutting strategies, but rather to improve value
(health outcomes achieved per monetary unit spent)2. T
o
align the objectives of clinicians, patients and providers, a
greater emphasis on value is key, and achieving high value
care for patients must become the goal of healthcare deliv-
ery, thereby reducing costs3–5.
Improvements in value can be achieved if resources are
reallocated from low-value services towards equally (or
more) effective, but less costly, approaches. In the UK, the
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)
commenced a formal agenda in 2006 to address the issue
of disinvesting in low-value care/procedure/practice6.
Initially, a pilot disinvestment programme was introduced,
aiming to identify low-value interventions that, if stopped,
would save over €1⋅14 million per intervention. However,
this was abandoned after NICE concluded that there were
few identifiable candidates for total disinvestment, and that
NICE’
s previous strategies (of forming clinical guidance)
were already indirectly identifying potential candidates
for disinvestment. Consequently, NICE has published
recommendation reminders reiterating existing guidance.
Furthermore, following the launch of the Department
of Health’
s Quality, Productivity and Prevention pro-
gramme, NICE reviewed its disinvestment programme
and issued ‘
Do not do’ recommendations from their
existing guidance7.
Internationally, the Choosing Wisely movement has also
addressed this issue through the promotion of physician
and patient conversation, in order to reduce unnecessary
interventions. Each specialty was asked to follow the lead
taken by the American Board of Internal Medicine by
issuing a list of five procedures considered to be of low
value, and to reduce their use. The Choosing Wisely
campaign has flourished, and has been adopted by other
countries including Australia, Germany, Italy, Japan, the
Netherlands and Switzerland8–10.

There have been challenges to the Choosing Wisely pro-
gramme, of note the withdrawal of the American Associa-
tion of Clinical Endocrinologists, and the limited uptake
of issued guidance11. Furthermore, surgical societies have
selected only low-cost procedures for consideration in the
Choosing Wisely campaign9,
11–16. The UK recently issued
its own Choosing Wisely guidance17, with the notable
absence of surgical interventions. This appears to be a
missed opportunity to improve value, given the financial
burden of surgery within health budgets.
An initial step would be to establish a systematic and
transparent strategy to identify low-value clinical services
for review, with reference to general surgery, the goal
being to stimulate discussion, with the objective of reduc-
ing low-value care in surgery. The present review focuses
on general surgical interventions, and classifies those inter-
ventions in terms of potential disinvestment opportunity. A
further step was taken to evaluate the impact on the health
budget by estimating the monetary value of those low-value
interventions.
Methods
A multiplatform method of identifying low-value services
was undertaken. This included a peer-reviewed literature
search, a targeted database search, and opportunistic sam-
pling. The intention was to identify general surgical pro-
cedures or interventions that are currently employed as a
result of established practice, or previously published guid-
ance that more recently published research has found to
be ineffective, with overestimated or incorrect outcome
improvements18.
A recognized difficulty with research in the field of dis-
investment is the lack of established terminology used to
describe low-value procedures19,
20. Therefore, an exten-
sive list of keywords was required to perform a compre-
hensive literature evaluation. The method used presently
was similar to that of other published approaches11. Previ-
ous strategies have yielded such a vast number of articles
(159 858 citations) that it was impossible to evaluate every
citation and only a fraction of the citations were reviewed
(1500 papers). Given this, the present literature review
employed strict limitations, gathering the maximum num-
ber of relevant papers, in order to accumulate a manageable
number of citations that could be evaluated systematically
to identify low-value procedures.
Literature review
A MEDLINE search strategy using the PubMed interface
was employed, using the keywords and Medical Subject

The choice of search terms was influenced by previous
search strategies11. Filters were applied to identify cita-
tions published between 2000 and 2015, publication type
(only meta-analyses and systematic reviews were consid-
ered), English-language articles, and those with available
abstracts. The inclusion of only high-level evidence is
due to clinician perspectives that compelling evidence is
required for a change in current practice. This had the
additional benefit of narrowing the number of citations
to a manageable volume21. Titles, abstracts and full-text
articles were screened according to the previously stated
exclusion criteria (Table 2).

 Savings from reducing low-value general surgical interventions

Targeted database search
All reports from the Cochrane Library were considered,
after standard filters (humans, English language, surgery)
had been applied. Similarly, all reports from the NICE ‘
Do
not do’recommendations were reviewed. The reason for
reviewing these databases is that they both offer valuable
sources of high-level evidence that identify areas of current
overuse and low-value practices. Therefore, a further 1345
and 1000 citations, respectively, were reviewed using this
search method.
Choosing Wisely
All currently published recommendations from the Choos-
ing Wisely movements in the USA, Canada, Japan, Aus-
tralia and the Netherlands were reviewed. These are based
on consensus opinion of established medical literature with
the aim of identifying services to stop, and are thus a rele-
vant source of guidance on low-value practices.
Opportunistic sampling
Opportunistic sampling included reports identified by
reviewing the full-text article citations; bibliographies of
identified key articles were hand-searched for additional
relevant articles.
A master list of surgical services was compiled follow-
ing the three search strategies (Appendix S1, supporting
information). All citations were assessed to ensure they
addressed a clinical general surgical practice or a diagnostic
test, and that they had evaluated it against current prac-
tice. If no comparison was made, or no clinically relevant
outcome was measured and superiority/inferiority demon-
strated, the article was excluded, as value of intervention
was not determined. Any article concerning novel insights
into pathophysiology or a novel molecular basis of disease
was excluded. When practice information could not be
identified by the abstract alone, the entire article was
reviewed. Studies that reported the value of a procedure
or service as inferior or similar to current strategies were
included.
Further estimation of the impact of each identified
low-value intervention was performed by evaluating cost
and calculating potential savings. This was done by assess-
ing both the cost of intervention and the incidence per
annum in the UK. The frequency of procedure performed
was included where available from the Procedures Explorer
T
ool on the Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) website for
the year 2014. This information is derived from the
Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data set, developed
through a collaborative project between the RCS Sur-
gical Specialty Associations, NHS England and Right
Care22. If frequency information was not available through
this method, a literature search was performed to iden-
tify relevant epidemiology. Frequency information was
identified for 36 of the 71 interventions (Appendix S1,
supporting information). Interventions for which volume
information was not identified included experimental
interventions where national data are unavailable (such
as use of protease inhibitors, single-incision surgery) or
where episodes are not coded for the specific practice (for
instance, second-look endoscopy following endoscopic
submucosal dissection, choice of expensive gauze dress-
ings). The median frequency (calculated from available
data) was 10 058.
Costing
information
was
taken
directly
from
the
National Schedule of Reference Costs 2014–201523.
Each intervention was costed according to its relevant
healthcare resource group (HRG), which is a reimburse-
ment tariff of the average unit cost to the NHS of providing
a defined service in a given financial year24. Any costs of an
intervention beyond the associated HRG, such as the cost
of specialized high-cost devices or costs of specific diagnos-
tic imaging per procedure (so-called ‘
unbundled HRGs’
),
were not accounted for as they are often not consistently
used for a given intervention24. Furthermore, assumptions
that the interventions were done on outpatients and did
not involve any co-morbidities were made in order to
make the most conservative estimate possible23. It should
be noted that this was a crude measure of costing, taking
into account only the cost of the intervention as defined by
reference costs HRGs, and without performing a formal
economic evaluation. Similarly, if costing information was
not available through this method, a literature search was
performed to identify relevant information. Unit costs
were identified for 57 of the 71 interventions (Appendix
S1, supporting information). Interventions for which the
costs were not identified included those where the cost
difference could not be calculated with ease owing to the
nature of intervention (such as the cost of extra theatre
time for omental wrapping in pancreatic surgery, the use
of loop ileostomy in preference to loop colostomy), as well
as interventions with a minimal difference between the
low-value intervention and the alternative (for example,
not
using
diathermy
to
prevent
surgical-site
infec-
tion, non-scalpel incision in vasectomy). The median
cost (from the available data) was calculated to be
€149⋅00.
T
o categorize the results further, the median cost and fre-
quency were used (€149⋅00 and 10 058 respectively). Thus,
all interventions of above-median cost were categorized

as high cost. Similarly, interventions that were performed
more commonly than the median were categorized into the
high-frequency group. Interventions where volume activity
information was not available (often due to the interven-
tion being experimental in nature, or not in routine use
as against current clinical orthodoxy) were automatically
considered low frequency. Ultimately, the interventions
were grouped into those with high frequency and high
cost (highest impact), low frequency and high cost, high
frequency and low cost, and low frequency and low cost
(lowest impact).
Results
The search strategy identified 6680 citations, from which
71 low-value services were identified (Fig. 1; Appendix S1,
supporting information). The literature review yielded
a final contribution of 22 services, with the Cochrane
database review identifying 19, the NICE ‘
Do not do’lists
identifying 27 recommendations, the Choosing Wisely
published guidance identifying 11 services, and an oppor-
tunistic review adding a further seven. After subtracting
duplicated low-value services (those identified through
more than one search strategy), a final list was compiled.
This list was then further stratified according to impact,
by defining the cost per intervention and frequency of
use. Five services were in the high-cost, high-frequency
group (highest impact); 22 in the high-cost, low-frequency
group; 23 in the low-cost, high-frequency group; and 21
in the low-cost, low-frequency group (lowest impact).
Highest impact group
High-frequency and high-cost procedures represent ser-
vices that place the greatest burden on the current health
economy (Table 3). Traditionally, patients with a hernia
are offered surgery to prevent hernia strangulation, which
in itself carries a mortality risk. However, the two ref-
erenced RCT
s25,
26 highlight the safety of watchful wait-
ing, indicating that the rate of hernia accident is 0⋅11 per
cent in patients aged over 65 years27. This suggests sur-
gical hernia repair is a low-value procedure. The North
American hernia trial’
s long-term follow-up27 indicated
that there was notable crossover between the two study
cohorts, as patients who presented initially with min-
imal symptoms may have developed worsening symp-
toms sufficient to warrant intervention. On the other
hand, Kaplan–Meier estimates found that after 10 years
32 per cent of patients would still be suitably treated with

Traditional treatment of cholecystitis involves anti-
microbials for the initial inflammatory response, followed
by surgery after an interval. Improved outcomes have
been demonstrated with index acute cholecystectomy.
Therefore, interval cholecystectomy is low value, with
a cost of €1269 per readmission between initial presen-
tation and eventual cholecystectomy43. There were 72
572 admissions with right upper quadrant pain, with a
30-day readmission rate of 16⋅75 per cent, amounting
to a total cost of €15 436 857. Further, savings of €934
per patient undergoing index cholecystectomy have been
estimated39. (Caution must be taken here, given the cited
study39 is a German RCT and costs were calculated on
the basis of Diagnosis Related Group classification in
2010.) Therefore, with 72 572 non-surgical admissions
for right upper quadrant pain, even if 80 per cent of these
patients were operated on acutely (a conservative estimate
of operative suitability given in the previously cited trial: of
642 patients, only 15 were excluded as unsuitable for acute
intervention), €54 251 823 could potentially be saved.
Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that the QALYs
of laparoscopic cholecystectomy performed within 3 days
of admission, beyond 3 days but in the same admission,
and electively in a subsequent admission were 0⋅888, 0⋅888
and 0⋅884 respectively over a 1-year horizon, indicating
that outcomes are not improved with different treatment
strategies54.
It is generally accepted that after an episode of acute
diverticulitis patients should have endoscopic evaluation to
rule out colorectal malignancy. However, recent evidence
has called this into question, with de Vries and co-workers’
systematic review46 finding that rates of colonic cancer and
advanced adenoma in patients with uncomplicated diver-
ticulitis are equal to, or even less than, the rates encoun-
tered in asymptomatic individuals. Therefore, endoscopy
following a radiological diagnosis may be considered low
value. There were 33 175 patients with an episode of
non-operated diverticulitis admitted in the year 2014 in the
UK. If each of these patients went on to have outpatient
flexible sigmoidoscopy, a cost of €8 392 770 would be
incurred.

priateness of referrals for gastroscopy, suggested that 22
per cent were not in line with guidance from the American

nostic overuse. With 552 078 procedures performed in
2014, this represents a burden of overuse of €40 614 688.
Middle and low impact
Within the high-cost and low-frequency group (Table 4)
is the use of early endoscopic retrograde cholangio-
pancreatography (ERCP) in acute gallstone pancreatitis,
which was recommended in the 2005 UK pancreatitis
guidelines66,
67. However, subsequent evidence, including
from a Cochrane review57 and other meta-analyses56,
suggests that there may be no benefit to early ERCP in
the absence of cholangitis. This is an example of newer
evidence changing practice. The incidence of acute pan-
creatitis is 30 per 100 000, of which 36⋅9 per cent are
caused by gallstones68. This is a potential 7095 candidates
for early ERCP (a low-value procedure), of whom 48 per
cent had acute ERCP in 200260; only a small proportion of
these (rate of cholangitis about 4 per cent according to Uy
et al.56) would benefit from early ERCP, with potentially
3122 low-value ERCPs being performed and potential
savings of €6 398 514.
Further interventions in the high-cost, low-frequency
group
include
those
involving
new
technologies
(5
interventions), procedures applied to rare diseases (4
interventions) and procedures not performed commonly
owing to alignment with current surgical practice (14
interventions) (Appendix S1, supporting information).
Protease inhibitors in ERCP69 and robotic surgery58–64
are examples of new technologies that are seldom used,
owing to limited availability. In the case of robotic surgery,
there is evidence of moderate improvement in out-
comes at a considerable cost, calculated to be €1259 per
robotic operation63,
64. Literature review also identified
different management pathways as being of low value,
including the use of second-look gastroscopy after endo-
scopic mucosal dissection48, the benefit of oesophageal
stenting before neoadjuvant chemotherapy70, and the
avoidance of risk-reducing surgery in those with limited
life expectancy71. These services reflect management path-
ways that have been instituted following a growing body
of evidence and are often not in current practice.

low value. A recent review84 of the practice of antibiotic

prophylaxis during operative hernia repair in London and
south-east England showed that 84 per cent of surgeons
believe antibiotics are indicated. The cost of a single dose
of co-amoxiclav is €2⋅99 and, with 54 894 hernia repairs
done in 2014, this would reflect a sum cost of €163 895 if
all patients received antimicrobials.
Lastly, the group of low-cost, low-frequency procedures
(Table 6) includes those that are performed rarely, often
with anecdotal evidence justifying current practice.
Discussion
This systematic approach has identified 71 low-value
general surgery services. The five with high impact
(commonly performed and costly) were: inguinal hernia
repair in patients with minimal symptoms, inappropriate
gastroscopy, interval cholecystectomy, CT to diagnose
appendicitis, and routine endoscopy in those who have
had imaging-confirmed diverticulitis. Estimated potential
opportunity savings to the NHS of stopping these pro-
cedures are €153 383 953 per annum. With five general
surgical procedures carrying a burden of €153 million, the
Audit Commission’
s previous estimate89 (€570 million per
annum for all healthcare) is likely to be conservative. Iden-
tification and stopping of low-value services represents
a significantly greater opportunity for efficiency savings
than thought previously. Furthermore, the assessment
used conservative assumptions – that all procedures were
performed where possible as an outpatient (in the case
of endoscopy, ERCP, hernia repair) and in individuals
without co-morbidities.
This study also demonstrates the potential opportu-
nity cost of low-value services. For instance, although a
high-impact procedure such as index laparoscopic chole-
cystectomy may offer savings of €67 million per annum,
a reduction in the use of mechanical bowel preparation, a
low-impact procedure, will confer annual maximum sav-
ings of less than €114 000. It is therefore important that
clinicians and providers focus debate on the potential
reduction of high-impact services.
There are pitfalls with labelling a procedure as low
value, as clinical context dictates value90. A prime example
is inguinal hernia repair in the minimally symptomatic
individual. Although the two cited RCT
s25,
26 both found
watch-and-wait therapy to be equivalent to surgical repair
in the short term, long-term follow-up identified a pref-
erence for surgical treatment. Thus, for patients whose
symptoms worsened, the procedure would have been of
high value. Therefore, an intervention is only low value
when applied in the correct clinical context, and stopping
these procedures will not be without problems. Complete
cessation of elective inguinal hernia repair would result in
the reduction of uncomplicated day-case operations with
optimal outcomes, to an increase in emergency surgery
where further complications such as bowel resection may
ensue25,
26.
Similarly, stopping CT for the diagnosis of appendici-
tis may result in incorrect or delayed treatment and sub-
sequently patient harm28–38. Although CT should be
considered low value, it may well be that the expertise
for accurate ultrasonography, which is heavily operator
dependent, is not readily available (particularly out of
hours).
Endoscopy following a radiological diagnosis of diverti-
culitis has been presented as low value here44–47. Yet stop-
ping it may result in missing an early colorectal cancer.
Endoscopy should still be considered in patients who have
a high risk of colorectal cancer, such as those with a family
history.
It is important that stopping low-value interventions hap-
pens only in correct clinical populations where the inter-
vention is of little benefit. The challenge lies in identifying
patients for whom the clinical context dictates the inter-
vention as low value. Thus, the classical surgical adage of
careful patient selection proves true to both economic and
surgical objectives.
This study has several limitations. First, the list is not
exhaustive, as it focuses solely on high-level evidence
(meta-analysis, RCT or systematic review) over a 5-year
interval. It is possible that citations that may be relevant
have fallen outside the search criteria91.
Another challenge is the limitation of the administra-
tive data sets used. For example, when reviewing the use
of flexible sigmoidoscopy after CT diagnosis of diver-
ticular disease, or early ERCP in gallstone pancreatitis,
although the volume of each procedure was recorded,
the indication was not. It is not possible to identify the
number of inappropriate procedures performed nation-
ally. Although the number of flexible sigmoidoscopies per-
formed is known, the number of procedures that followed
uncomplicated diverticular disease is not. Similarly, the
number of early ERCPs performed in gallstone pancre-
atitis in the absence of cholangitis is unclear. Therefore,
assumptions have been made based on potentially outdated
literature92, or indeed by assuming that surgical orthodoxy
will result in all patients with CT-confirmed diverticulitis
having flexible sigmoidoscopy. In the case of interval chole-
cystectomy, costs have been estimated from literature not
based in the UK, as the cited study is a German RCT and
costs therefore were calculated on the basis of German
Diagnosis Related Group classification, using data from
201039. It may be incorrect to extrapolate findings from

Accurately
estimating
the
volume
activity
of
the
high-cost,

procedures
has
proven
difficult. This is often due to the experimental nature
of these therapies (for example, robotic and single-incision
surgery, protease inhibitor use in ERCP, tetrastarch for
fluid resuscitation, and heated carbon dioxide during
laparoscopy), as well as the fact that this group deals with
disease of rarity. This part of the list often describes pro-
cedures that are not performed routinely because current
surgical practice is aligned with published guidelines such
as avoiding treating varicosities in pregnancy, avoiding
routinely offering a defunctioning stoma in operations for
anal incontinence, and not offering risk-reducing surgery
where there is limited life expectancy. Such services were
often found through NICE’
s ‘
Do not do’database, high-
lighting how many of their recommendations are already
in line with current practice.
The literature search has highlighted a number of
novel technologies, in particular the robotic technique
and single-incision approaches. When compared with
conventional techniques, outcomes are improved only
marginally. Thus, they must be considered low value and
a potential candidate for disinvestment. The European
Association for Endoscopic Surgery cautions that the
benefits of a robotic approach have not been measured,
but that it could offer great ‘
potential with sophisticated
electromechanical systems’
58. There is a global acceptance
that robotic surgery is likely to be common in operat-
ing theatres of the future, although the costs remain
high93.
This paper should serve as a stimulus for discussion
among surgeons, patients and commissioners. It highlights
that, in the surgical sphere, there are a number of low-value
services that could be stopped, with significant savings.
