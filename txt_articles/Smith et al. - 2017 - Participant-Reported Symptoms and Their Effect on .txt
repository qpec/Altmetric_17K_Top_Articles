Purpose
To assess the role of participant-reported symptoms on long-term adherence to preventive therapy
in the United Kingdom sample of the International Breast Cancer Intervention Study (IBIS-I). IBIS-I
was a randomized controlled trial that investigated the effectiveness of tamoxifen in reducing the
risk of breast cancer among women at increased risk of the disease.
Participants and Methods
Women were randomly assigned to tamoxifen versus placebo (20 mg/day; n = 4,279). After 456
exclusions, 3,823 women were included in this analysis. Adherence (, 4.5 years or $ 4.5 years)
was calculated using data from six monthly clinical visits. Analyses were adjusted for age, Tyrer-
Cuzick risk, smoking, use of hormone replacement therapy, menopausal status, baseline meno-
pausal symptoms, and treatment.
Results
Overall, 69.7% of women were adherent for at least 4.5 years (tamoxifen: 65.2% v placebo: 74.0%;
P , .001). Differences in adherence between treatment arms were observed from 12 months
onward (all P , .01) and were largest at 54 months. Dropout rates were highest in the first 12 to
18 months and decreased thereafter. Women reporting nausea/vomiting were less likely to be
adherent in both the tamoxifen (odds ratio [OR], 0.57; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.86; P = .007) and placebo
(OR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.93; P = .023) arms. Headaches were associated with adherence only in
the placebo arm (OR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.42 to 0.91; P = .016), whereas gynecologic symptoms were
significant only in the tamoxifen arm (OR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.62 to 0.97; P = .024). Effect sizes for each
symptom on adherence were not significantly different between the treatment groups (P . .05). In
both treatment arms, we observed significant trends for lower adherence with increasing severity
for all symptoms (P , .01) except headaches (P = .054).
Conclusion
In the IBIS-I trial, experiencing predefined symptoms in the first 6 months reduced long-term
adherence. Effects were similar between treatment arms, suggesting that women were attributing
age-related symptoms to preventive therapy. Interventions were required to support symptom
management.

INTRODUCTION
Breast cancer remains the most commonly di-
agnosed cancer in women from developed coun-
tries.1 In 2013, more than 50,000 women were
diagnosed with breast cancer in the United King-
dom, and 11,643 deaths were recorded in 2012.2
Incidence of the disease has rapidly increased since
the 1970s,3,4 with one in eight women now expected
to be diagnosed with breast cancer in her lifetime.5
Efforts to prevent the disease are therefore taking on
greater significance.6
Preventive therapy is an option for women at
increased risk of breast cancer resulting from
known risk factors such as having a family his-
tory of the disease. Individual participant data
from nine primary prevention trials showed
a reduction in breast cancer incidence of at least
30% among women who used selective estrogen
receptor modulators.7 These data also show
an increased risk of thromboembolic events and

 endometrial cancer among women receiving preventive therapy,
tamoxifen in particular. Data from the International Breast Cancer
Intervention Study (IBIS-I) showed that the preventive effects of
tamoxifen last at least 20 years.8 However, uptake of preventive
therapy is low, with only 16% of women opting to use chemo-
prevention after it has been offered.9 Patient concern about adverse
effects of drugs is a major deterrent to initiating preventive therapy.10-14
Women who adhere to the full course of medication are more
likely to experience benefit; however, adherence to the recom-
mended course of therapy is suboptimal.9 Among preventive
therapy trials reporting 5-year follow-up, 5-year adherence ranges
from 61%15 to 81%.16 Menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes
and irregular bleeding are common among women taking selective
estrogen receptor modulators17-19 and may reduce adherence.9
Studies that collected off-therapy forms report that more than half
of all women who drop out of preventive therapy trials attribute
their decision to adverse effects of medication.20-23 However,
retrospectively assessing decisions to discontinue medications may
be a biased approach.
Data from the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel
Project, Prevention-1 (NSABP P-1) trial, also called the Breast
Cancer Prevention Trial (BCPT), show that after 12 months, 84%
of participants were considered to be adherent, which is defined as
taking at least 76% of their medication.17 In models adjusted for
participant characteristics and participant-reported outcomes,
women who had a higher quality of life after 3 months of therapy,
as assessed by the mental component of the 36-Item Short Form
Health Survey (SF-36), were more likely to be adherent. Women
who experienced gynecologic, vasomotor, or sexual symptoms
were less likely to be adherent after 1 year. No studies have ex-
amined associations between these symptoms and adherence using
5-year follow-up data.
The aim of this analysis was to assess the role of predefined
symptoms on long-term adherence in the United Kingdom sample
from IBIS-I. We hypothesized that there would be associations
between nausea/vomiting, headaches, hot flashes, irregular bleed-
ing, vaginal dryness, and vaginal discharge recorded at the 6-month
follow-up and lower adherence to the full course of therapy. These
effects were expected to be similar across treatment arms. Because
these symptoms occur primarily in the first 12 months of treat-
ment,24 we anticipated a higher rate of dropout in the first year
compared with the remaining years of the trial. We hypothesized
that the effect of the predefined symptoms on adherence would be
larger among women reporting more severe symptoms.
PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS
Participants and Procedures
Details of the trial design and entry criteria are described
elsewhere.8,25 Briefly, women age 35 to 70 years at increased risk of
developing breast cancer were recruited between April 1992 and March
2001 from various centers in Australia/New Zealand, the United
Kingdom, and other European countries. Written informed consent to
participate was collected after an initial discussion with an IBIS-I
physician and a consideration period of at least 24 hours. For this
analysis, only data from the United Kingdom were reported because
case report forms and adherence data were not as reliably collected in
other countries. Women were excluded from the adherence analysis if
they died, were diagnosed with any invasive cancer (excluding non-
melanoma skin cancer), experienced a thromboembolic event or deep
vein thrombosis, or underwent a prophylactic mastectomy during the
5-year active treatment phase. Women who withdrew within the first
6 months after random assignment were also excluded from the main
analyses.
On study entry, women were randomly assigned to 5 years of
treatment with tamoxifen (20 mg/day) or matching placebo on a 1:1 basis.
A baseline case report form was completed for each participant, which
assessed baseline demographics (eg, age) and clinical information (eg,
baseline menopausal symptoms and family history). All women received
follow-up via six monthly visits or telephone calls for the duration of the
active treatment period (60 months). During these follow-ups, current use
of the assigned medication was assessed, and patient symptoms in the
previous 6 months were self-reported using predefined items. Local ethics
committees approved the trial at each participating institution.
Measures
Adherence. Adherence was defined as the period of persistent use of
the allocated medication from initiation to cessation.26 In our data, ad-
herence was calculated by using the period of time between the trial
randomization date and the date of the final follow-up visit. Trial co-
ordinators recorded whether participants were still using their allocated
medication at each time point (yes/no). Notes on adherence were described
on the case report forms (eg, if a patient could not be contacted). Pre-
defined rules developed for these analyses were used by two researchers to
review all case report forms and assess adherence (see the Appendix, online
only). Women who marked “no” for their use of the medication at any
point were classified as nonadherent. Agreement between the two raters
was high (k, 0.95). Each participant was assessed for persistent use of the
medication for at least 4.5 years (adherent) or stopping before 4.5 years
(nonadherent).
Participant symptoms. Any menopausal symptoms before beginning
the trial were recorded in the baseline case report form (yes/no). Sub-
sequent symptoms were assessed every 6 months during clinical visits or
telephone calls by using predefined items for nausea, vomiting, headaches,
hot flashes, irregular bleeding, vaginal dryness, and vaginal discharge.
Because of the low number of women reporting nausea and vomiting and
the similarities between these symptoms, these responses were combined.
Irregular bleeding, vaginal dryness, and vaginal discharge were more
common but were combined because the symptoms are similar (referred
to as gynecologic symptoms herein). All symptoms were classified as mild,
moderate, or severe as judged by the women.
Demographic and clinical variables. Baseline demographics included
age (, 50, 50 to 60, . 60 years), body mass index (, 25, 25 to 30, . 30,
unknown), family history (one affected relative or two or more affected
relatives), Tyrer-Cuzick 10-year breast cancer risk score (, 8%, $ 8%),
smoking status (never, current, ex), hormone replacement therapy (HRT)
use (never, current, ex), menopausal status (premenopausal, post-
menopausal), baseline menopausal symptoms (yes/no) and whether they
had undergone a hysterectomy (yes/no) or oophorectomy (yes [single], yes
[bilateral], no).
Statistical Analysis
We used the Kaplan-Meier method27 to estimate adherence at dif-
ferent follow-up times, both overall and by treatment group separately.
Baseline factors, treatment arm, and the occurrence of symptoms at month
6 were analyzed for the prediction of adherence by using logistic regression.
Predictors were included in the multivariable analyses if they were sig-
nificant in the univariable models. Tests of heterogeneity were used to
determine whether the effects of the predefined symptoms on adherence
were similar between the treatment groups. Changes in likelihood ratio
statistics were used to determine the effect of treatment and symptoms at
6 months on adherence. The analyses testing the effect of symptom severity
on adherence were also based on comparisons of proportions. We used

 a nonparametric test of trend for ranks across ordered groups. All P values
were two-sided and all CIs were at the 95% level. All calculations were
performed by using STATA version 13.1 (STATA, College Station, TX).
RESULTS
A total of 7,152 women were enrolled in the IBIS-I trial, 4,279 of
whom were from the United Kingdom and were included in this
analysis (CONSORT diagram; Fig 1). Women were excluded from
the adherence analysis if they did not consent (n = 1), were in-
eligible (n = 1), had breast cancer on entry (n = 13), were randomly
assigned in error (n = 1), or did not take tablets (n = 3). We then
inspected case report forms and further excluded all data from 273
women who were diagnosed with a cancer, including breast cancer
(n = 180), experienced a venous thromboembolic event (n = 18),
had undergone a prophylactic mastectomy (n = 16), did not initiate
any medication (n = 30), or died during the active treatment period
(n = 29). An additional 164 women withdrew from the study
within 6 months of random assignment and were also excluded
(97, tamoxifen arm; 67, placebo arm). Of these, 32 women re-
ported experiencing a symptom before the 6-month visit (19,
tamoxifen arm; 13, placebo arm). This left 3,823 women to be
included in the adherence analysis (1,890, tamoxifen arm; 1,933,
placebo arm). Baseline demographic and clinical factors were
balanced between treatment groups (Table 1).
Overall, 69.7% of women were adherent for at least 4.5 years.
Kaplan-Meier estimates for adherence were significantly higher
among women taking placebo (75.2%) than among those taking
tamoxifen (66.8%; hazard ratio [HR], 1.43; 95% CI, 1.27 to 1.60;
P , .001; Fig 2). The mean time on treatment was 4.3 years (standard
deviation [SD], 1.4), and this was higher on the placebo arm (mean,
4.4 years [SD, 1.3 years]) than on the tamoxifen arm (mean, 4.1 years
[SD, 1.5 years]; P , .001). Significant differences in the proportion
of women who were classified as adherent between treatment arms
were observed after 12 months (P , .003), and differences were
largest at 54 months. Overall, annual dropout rates were highest
within the first 12 to 18 months of follow-up (12.2%, tamoxifen
arm; 7.4%, placebo arm) and decreased thereafter (Fig 3).
In univariable analysis, family history, smoking status, HRT
use, menopausal status, occurrence of hysterectomy, baseline
menopausal symptoms, and treatment arm were significantly
associated with adherence and were entered into the multivariable
model (Table 2). In the multivariable analysis, women in the ta-
moxifen arm (OR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.58 to 0.77; P , .001) and
women with any baseline menopausal symptoms (OR, 0.73; 95%
CI, 0.62 to 0.86; P , .001) were less likely to be adherent at follow-
up. Significantly lower odds of adherence were also observed in
current smokers (OR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.47 to 0.68; P , .001), ex-
smokers (OR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.69 to 0.96; P = .016), users of HRTat
baseline (OR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.67 to 0.98; P = .028), and ex-users of
HRT (OR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.84; P , .001). Higher odds of
adherence were noted with increasing age (OR, 1.03 per year; 95%
CI, 1.02 to 1.05 per year; P , .001), premenopausal women (OR,
1.29; 95% CI, 1.07 to 1.56; P = .009), and those with a higher Tyrer-
Cuzick risk score (OR, 1.03 per 1% increase; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.06
per 1% increase; P = .046).
Baseline menopausal symptoms were reported by 25.0% of
women, but the difference between treatment arms was not sta-
tistically significant (P = .74). At 6-month follow-up, a low pro-
portion of women experienced nausea/vomiting (5.6% tamoxifen
arm v 4.5% placebo arm; P = .14) and headaches (7.3% tamoxifen
arm v 6.8% placebo arm; P = .53), whereas gynecologic symptoms
(28.9% tamoxifen arm v 14.2% placebo arm; P , .001) and hot
flashes (44.2% tamoxifen arm v 20.5% placebo arm; P , .001) were
more common and significantly different between treatment arms.
More than half (53%) of nonadherence is explained by treatment
group (P , .001) and an additional 22% of nonadherence is
explained by reporting any of the aforementioned symptoms at
6 months (P = .002).
Women reporting nausea/vomiting were less likely to be
adherent in both the tamoxifen (OR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.86;
P = .007) and placebo (OR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.93; P = .023)
arms (Table 3). Headaches were associated with adherence in the
placebo arm only (OR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.42 to 0.91; P = .016),
whereas gynecologic symptoms were significant in the tamoxifen
arm (OR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.62 to 0.97; P = .024; Table 3). Hot
flashes were not associated with adherence in either treatment
group. Tests of heterogeneity showed that the effect sizes for each
symptom on adherence were not significantly different between
the treatment groups (nausea/vomiting, P = .96; headaches, P = .25;
hot flashes, P =.53; gynecologic symptoms, P = .24).

 The majority of symptoms reported at 6 months among both
treatment groups were of mild or moderate severity (Fig 4). There
were significant trends for lower adherence with increasing severity
for all symptoms (P , .002 to P , .001), with the exception of
headaches (P = .054).
DISCUSSION
In the IBIS-I primary prevention trial, two thirds of women were
adherent to tamoxifen or matching placebo for the duration of
therapy. Dropout rates were highest in the tamoxifen arm, par-
ticularly after the first 12 months of follow-up, which coincides
with the period when women are most susceptible to experiencing
adverse effects from the drug.24 The association between nausea/
vomiting, headaches, hot flashes, and gynecologic symptoms was
largely similar between the tamoxifen and placebo arms, and tests
of heterogeneity indicated no significant differences between the
arms. Women may therefore be attributing age-related symptoms
to their assigned medication. This is suggestive of the nocebo
response, whereby seemingly inert substances cause adverse
symptoms or effects.28
Bodily symptoms such as dizziness, headache, and fatigue are
frequently misattributed by clinical trial participants as adverse
effects of medications, and this also extends to participants on
the placebo arm.29-31 For example, as expected in the Inter-
national Breast Cancer Intervention Study II (IBIS II) trial, a
large proportion (64%) of women taking anastrozole reported

 musculoskeletal problems; however, only slightly lower proportions
of women experiencing this symptom (58%) were noted in the
placebo arm.32 Such symptoms are also common among healthy
people,33 demonstrating that trial participants may be misattributing
normal bodily changes to adverse effects of drugs. In line with
findings in the adjuvant setting, our data suggest that misattributing
non-medication symptoms as adverse effects can affect adherence.34
Our observations have implications for communicating with
women who are considering initiating preventive therapy and for
those already using it. Research from the literature on chronic
disease has shown people with more negative general attitudes
toward medication at baseline are more likely to misattribute
non-medication symptoms as adverse effects.35 Addressing
such concerns in women before preventive therapy is initiated
may reduce symptom misattribution and have consequent
positive effects on medication adherence.36 Discussing the
prevalence and natural history of symptoms with women
before therapy is initiated may also affect their interpretation
of normal bodily changes. This information will be particularly
important for women who are expected to experience men-
opause while taking preventive therapy. These discussions may
encourage more realistic expectations of the likelihood of
experiencing adverse effects, which have been shown to be
powerful drivers of subsequent experience37 and adherence in
the adjuvant setting.38
Although it is commonly thought that treatment-related
adverse effects affect adherence to preventive therapy for breast
cancer, the evidence supporting this assumption is weak. A recent
systematic review of adherence to preventive therapy for breast
cancer included studies that suggested an association between
adverse effects of treatment and persistent use of medication.9
However, the design of these studies was subject to bias because of
retrospective recall when completing the off-therapy forms and an
inability to compare adherence rates between those who did and
did not experience adverse effects.20-23 Data from the NSABP P-1
trial has demonstrated the role of gynecologic, vasomotor, and
sexual symptoms on adherence at 1-year follow-up.17 Our analysis
adds to these data by demonstrating that more than one fifth of
5-year nonadherence can be explained by participant-reported
early symptoms.

 To ensure that women experience the full benefit of preventive
therapy, interventions such as that used in the MENOS1 (Rando-
mised Controlled Trial of a Cognitive Behavioural Intervention for
Women Who Have Menopausal Symptoms Following Breast Cancer
Treatment)39 trial have been successful in helping to manage
symptoms. Physical activity has also been shown to reduce the
impact of adverse effects experienced in the adjuvant breast cancer
setting, including fatigue,40 arthralgia,41 and menopausal symp-
toms.42 Medication-taking behavior was not assessed as an outcome
within these trials, and the extent to which improving symptoms and
adverse effects by physical activity translates to improved adherence
remains an unexplored hypothesis.
This study had notable strengths and limitations. We are
among the first to prospectively investigate the association between
these predefined symptoms and subsequent long-term adherence
in women taking breast cancer preventive therapy. The analysis
used data from the IBIS-I trial, which includes a large sample of
well-characterized women who regularly completed clinic visits
during which adherence was assessed. However, there is no current
gold standard for assessing adherence. Although there are nota-
ble advantages to using clinician-assessed case report forms, this
method may be subject to bias, which likely led us to overestimate
adherence. Adherence was defined as the time between initiating
and stopping the medication.26 However, we did not report the use
of medications on a day-to-day basis, and different patterns of
associations between our exposure and outcome variables may be
expected if adherence was defined differently. Our data were
collected in the context of a clinical trial with women who may have
a stronger motivation to participate than those taking tamoxifen as
part of usual care. Our adherence estimates may therefore be
higher than achievable in routine practice, and additional research
is needed to investigate adherence outside a trial context.43 Our
analysis focused on the relationship between early symptoms and
long-term adherence because the majority of the symptoms we

 assessed occur within the first year of therapy.24 However, the
symptoms experienced by some women may have been transient,
which may have weakened the relationship between experiencing
a symptom and subsequent adherence. Reporting an early symptom
may also be a marker for subsequent experience, and the evolution
of these symptoms was not investigated as part of this analysis.
Late-onset symptoms may be contributing to the 25% of un-
explained variance in 5-year adherence that we identified within
these data. Finally, because of time constraints in the clinic visits,
we assessed the experience of symptoms by using single severity
measures for each item. These measures do not assess the effect of
symptoms on physical, mental, or sexual quality of life. Participant-
reported outcome measures assessing these factors may be more
closely associated with adherence.17
In conclusion, these data from the IBIS-I breast cancer
preventive therapy trial show that the effect of nausea/vomiting,
headaches, hot flashes, and gynecologic symptoms on adherence
was similar between tamoxifen and placebo arms, suggesting that
women are attributing non-medication–related bodily changes
to preventive therapy. Our data have implications for commu-
nicating with prospective users of preventive therapy, particu-
larly with regard to encouraging accurate symptom expectations
and correcting potential misattributions. Intervention strate-
gies are needed to promote adherence, as well as to effectively
communicate the harms and benefits of preventive therapy to
participants.
