Abstract
Background: Wine glass size can influence both perceptions of portion size and the amount poured, but its
impact upon purchasing and consumption is unknown. This study aimed to examine the impact of wine glass size
on wine sales for on-site consumption, keeping portion size constant.
Methods: In one establishment (with separate bar and restaurant areas) in Cambridge, England, wine glass size
(Standard; Larger; Smaller) was changed over eight fortnightly periods. The bar and restaurant differ in wine sales
by the glass vs. by the bottle (93 % vs. 63 % by the glass respectively).
Results: Daily wine volume purchased was 9.4 % (95 % CI: 1.9, 17.5) higher when sold in larger compared to
standard-sized glasses. This effect seemed principally driven by sales in the bar area (bar: 14.4 % [3.3, 26.7];
restaurant: 8.2 % [−2.5, 20.1]). Findings were inconclusive as to whether sales were different with smaller vs.
standard-sized glasses.
Conclusions: The size of glasses in which wine is sold, keeping the portion size constant, can affect consumption,
with larger glasses increasing consumption. The hypothesised mechanisms for these differential effects need to be
tested in a replication study. If replicated, policy implications could include considering glass size amongst alcohol
licensing requirements.

Background
Alcohol consumption is ranked 5th amongst the 20 lead-
ing risk factors for global burden of disease [1]. In
addition to price, availability and marketing [2–4], other
cues may also encourage people to drink more than they
might otherwise, such as glassware and portion size. A
recent Cochrane systematic review provided evidence
that larger portion, package and tableware size increase
consumption of food and non-alcoholic beverages [5].
Whilst this review did not identify any studies concern-
ing the impact of these cues on alcohol consumption, it
seems reasonable to expect that serving wine in larger
portions, bottles and glassware will increase its con-
sumption. The mechanisms underlying the “portion size
effect” are not fully understood. People generally per-
ceive the amount served to them as representing an ap-
propriate portion size and consume less when offered
smaller portions and more when offered larger portions
[6].The portion sizes, therefore, we routinely encounter
can shape the social and personal norms for what we
consider a suitable amount to consume [7]. The amount
of food or the size of a non-alcoholic drink in front of us
can also influence the size of bites or sips taken, with
larger quantities resulting in larger bites or sips [8, 9].
The way in which food and drink is presented can also
influence consumption. For example, the size and shape
of a plate or glass can alter perceptions of quantity and

 influence how much is served [10, 11]. These effects
may often operate outside of awareness [12, 13] making
smaller default sizes for portions, packages and table-
ware effective barriers to the overconsumption that lar-
ger sizes cue [14].
The aim of the current study is to generate prelimin-
ary evidence of the impact of wine glass size on sales of
wine for on-site consumption in one UK bar/restaurant.
Wine in the UK can be purchased either by the glass,
with a set portion (125 ml (must be available), 175 ml or
250 ml), or by the bottle (standard size: 750 ml). The
mechanisms underlying any effect of glass size on con-
sumption may differ according to whether it is bought
and consumed by the bottle or by the glass [12, 15, 16].
Glasses
provided alongside
bottles
may
affect
the
actual
portion served (by
influencing the
amount
poured) [17–19], and glasses containing pre-served
portions may change perceptions of portion size [20, 21]
and in turn how much is consumed. However, such effects
may be curbed if people drink a certain number of
glasses of wine regardless of the perceived size of the
glasses [22–24]. This study reports the effects of wine
glass size on wine sales, examining the results within
separate bar and restaurant areas of one UK establish-
ment –– where sales varied in terms of the extent to
which these occurred by the glass or by the bottle.
Methods
Setting
The study was conducted in an independent eating and
drinking establishment in Cambridge, England, from
mid-March to early July 2015. The establishment had
separate bar and restaurant areas, both selling food and
drink, where wine could be purchased by the glass
(125 ml or 175 ml), bottle (750 ml) or carafe (500 ml or
1000 ml). All wine purchases were usually served in the
establishment’s standard glass, which had a 300 ml cap-
acity. During the study period, sales by the glass
accounted for around 78 % of total wine transactions in
the establishment. Approximately 90 % of wine sold by
the glass was in 175 ml portions, with the remaining
10 % being 125 ml portions. The establishment sold on
average 126.6 litres of wine per week (S.D. 14.9 litres)
for the equivalent period in 2014 (9.9 % of their total
sales); the equivalent figure for the study period was
121.0 litres (S.D. 12.6). The average price of a 175 ml
glass of wine in the establishment for the study
period was around £5 (€7/$7.50) (UK average £3.46
(€5/$5) [25]).
Design
The study design involved repeated baseline and inter-
vention phases, with each of eight consecutive periods
lasting two weeks:
A: Baseline: standard 300 ml glass used
B: Larger 370 ml glass replaced standard glass
A: Standard 300 ml glass used
C: Smaller 250 ml glass replaced standard glass
B: Larger glass
A: Standard glass
C: Smaller glass
A: Standard glass
The primary outcome was the daily volume of wine
(ml) purchased in ‘Larger glass’ and ‘Smaller glass’ inter-
vention periods compared to baseline (all ‘A’ periods).
Procedure
Three different sized but similarly shaped wine glasses
were used in the establishment for each of eight fort-
nightly periods. The glasses were used both when
serving wine by the glass and when providing glasses for
purchases of bottles or carafes of wine (i.e. without
changing portion sizes). In keeping with their license to
sell alcohol, wine served by the glass was measured out
by bar staff using CE stainless steel thimbles (Beaumont
tm) which, when filled to the brim, contained the volume
specified on the thimble (i.e. 125 ml or 175 ml). Glasses
not being used in that fortnightly period were removed
from the establishment’s shelves, so that only the appro-
priate glass size was available. There were no changes to
the establishment’s wine menu or pricing during the
study period.
The standard glasses used in the target establishment
were unlined Royal Leerdam Fortius glasses (see Fig. 1),
with a capacity of 300 ml. The two additional glasses
were: Smaller: 250 ml glass of same design; Larger:
370 ml glass of same design.
Sales data were obtained from the establishment’s till
records. Daily wine volume (ml) sold was calculated by
multiplying each volume available to purchase (e.g.,
175 ml glasses, 750 ml bottles) by the number of units
sold daily, and summing across all wine purchases.
Analysis
Regression analyses predicted daily volume of wine (ml)
purchased from glass size. Analyses included dummy
variables as covariates for day of the week, overall sales
in the establishment each day (excluding wine sales),
and maximum daily temperature in Cambridge [26].
Equivalent wine sales in the previous year (allowing
adjustment for seasonal fluctuations in sales), holiday
periods (two dummies indicating school holidays and
public holidays) were also explored as covariates, but
were non-significant and led to worse model predictions,
so were excluded from final analyses. The number of
items sold (excluding wine sales) for each day was used
as a proxy for the number of customers, to control for
sales fluctuations over time. Both wine sales and sales

 excluding wine were logged in the analyses. Due to het-
eroscedasticity, both the mean and variance of sales (see
Table 2) were included in models (using identity and log
links respectively).
Analyses were also conducted separately for the bar
and restaurant areas of the establishment, given the dif-
ferential distribution of wine sales by the glass in the
two areas (bar: 93 % by the glass; restaurant: 63 % by the
glass).
Results
Table 1 presents the unadjusted mean daily volumes of
wine sold, overall and in the bar and restaurant areas.
The raw data here suggest higher sales on days when
using larger glasses compared to days using standard
glasses, with an inconsistent pattern for smaller glasses.
However, this does not control for potential con-
founders, such as establishment busyness, with, for ex-
ample, the first fortnight when larger glasses were used
overlapping with the Easter weekend.
The results of the regression analyses are presented in
Table 2. Figure 2 shows the effect of the glass size on
sales expressed in percentage. It suggests that there was
an effect of larger glass size (compared to standard glass
size) overall and in the bar area, with increases in daily
wine sales of 9.4 % (95 % CI: 1.9, 17.5) and 14.4 % (95 %
CI: 3.3, 26.7) respectively. In the restaurant area, a simi-
lar direction of effect was seen but was not significant
(8.2 %; 95 % CI: −2.5, 20.1). Findings were inconclusive
as to whether wine sales were different with smaller vs.
standard glasses.
Discussion
Consistent with evidence from the recent Cochrane sys-
tematic review that tableware size influences consump-
tion of food and non-alcoholic beverages [5], the larger
glass size had an effect on overall wine sales (compared
to standard glasses). However, results were inconclusive
for the smaller glass size. Separating out the results in
the different areas of the establishment, the effect for
larger glasses was significant in the bar area, but not in
the restaurant area.
Almost all sales in the bar were by the glass. As glasses
containing pre-served portions may change perceptions
of portion size [20, 21], the results for the larger glasses
in the bar area are consistent with larger glasses being
perceived to contain less, given the same actual portion
[21]. As a result, portions may be drunk faster [20],
which may lead people to drink more. Alternatively,
there may be decreased satisfaction with perceived-to-be
smaller portions or a perception that the portion did not
comprise a full glass, leading to additional purchases.
However, these mechanisms might be expected to oper-
ate across glass sizes (i.e., we should observe similar pat-
terns when comparing the smaller and standard glasses),
which was not evident in this study. This requires

 further investigation as to which glass comparisons yield
similar results. Additional field studies are warranted
alongside laboratory studies to test the two hypotheses
for the observed effect outlined above. These findings
can be considered within the broader literature of the
many sensory and behavioural cues that influence
the consumption of alcohol, of which size is just one
[27, 28]. Future research might ultimately attempt to
elucidate the combination of cues that reduced alcohol
consumption the most.
The effect size of the larger wine glasses in the res-
taurant area, where sales by bottles and carafes repre-
sented 1/3 of the sales but 2/3 of the volume, while they
represented 1/15 of the sales and 1/5 of the volume in
the bar, did not reach statistical significance. This may
reflect a smaller effect size of wine glass size in this con-
text that the study was insufficiently powered to detect.
Replication of the current study is needed in other set-
tings where wine is served primarily using bottles or
carafes in studies powered to detect smaller but poten-
tially important effect sizes.
Strengths and limitations
This study is the first, to our knowledge, to explore the
impact of glass size on wine sales for on-site consumption
in a real-world setting (although it is likely that industry
research exists). Examining how wine sales were affected
in the bar area, where sales were predominantly by the
glass, suggests several possible mechanisms that might
underlie the influence of glass size, as described above.
However, several limitations should be noted. First, the
multiple treatment reversal design has a higher risk of
bias than an experimental design. Second, the predomin-
ance of sales by the glass in both the bar and restaurant
areas meant that we were unable to robustly examine
the effects of sales by the bottle. Third, the study took
place in only one establishment in a relatively affluent
English city. Finally, our outcome measure was sales for

 on-site consumption rather than consumption itself, al-
though this still represents an objective measure of
behaviour.
Implications for research and policy
Replication of the current intervention is needed.
Further field studies could reduce further the risk of
bias through experimental designs involving more
observations, conducted in settings that include less
affluent areas. Further investigations need to establish
the contexts in which the strongest effects are likely
to occur, including the extent to which these results
might extend to in-home alcohol consumption. While
further research is needed to establish the reliability
of these findings – and in particular, explore the use
of different glass sizes – the results offer initial evi-
dence that reducing the use of larger glasses may re-
duce consumption of alcohol. If further work does
suggest glass size might be an effective target for
intervention, the next step would be to explore how
this might be implemented [29]; for example, ensuring
that all glasses were below a certain size could be one cri-
terion amongst alcohol licensing requirements.
Conclusions
In summary, the size of glasses in which wine is sold,
keeping the portion size constant, affected wine sales,
but only when comparing larger glasses to standard
glasses. The possible mechanisms for these effects need
to be assessed in addition to replication of the current
study in other establishments.
