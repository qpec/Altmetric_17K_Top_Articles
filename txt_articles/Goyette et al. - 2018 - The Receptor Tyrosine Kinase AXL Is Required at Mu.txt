In Brief
Metastasis is responsible for the majority
of breast cancer deaths. Goyette et al.
report that AXL is expressed in HER2+
human tumors that acquire aggressive
features. Blockade of AXL in mice
decreases metastasis. These results
suggest that co-targeting AXL and HER2
may limit the metastatic progression of
HER2+ breast cancer.

SUMMARY
AXL is activated by its ligand GAS6 and is expressed
in triple-negative breast cancer cells. In the current
study, we report AXL expression in HER2-positive
(HER2+) breast cancers where it correlates with
poor patient survival. Using murine models of
HER2+ breast cancer, Axl, but not its ligand Gas6,
was found to be essential for metastasis. We deter-
mined that AXL is required for intravasation, extrava-
sation, and growth at the metastatic site. We found
that AXL is expressed in HER2+ cancers displaying
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) signa-
tures where it contributes to sustain EMT. Interfering
with AXL in a patient-derived xenograft (PDX)
impaired transforming growth factor b (TGF-b)-
induced cell invasion. Last, pharmacological inhibi-
tion of AXL specifically decreased the metastatic
burden of mice developing HER2+ breast cancer.
Our data identify AXL as a potential anti-metastatic
co-therapeutic target for the treatment of HER2+
breast cancers.
INTRODUCTION
Metastasis is a complex multistep process that involves intra-tu-
moral cell invasion followed by entry into the circulation (intrava-
sation), and completes when the cancer cells invade (extravasa-
tion) and survive in distant tissues to grow as macro-metastatic
lesions (Lambert et al., 2017). Unfortunately, once the disease
spreads to secondary organs it becomes virtually incurable
(Kedrin et al., 2007). Among breast cancers, both the Triple-
Negative (TNBC) and HER2-positive (HER2+) subtypes are
linked to poor survival due to their propensity for metastasis
(Seal and Chia, 2010; Visvader, 2009). HER2 is a member of
the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) of receptor tyrosine
kinases (RTKs) that is overexpressed or amplified in �20% of
human breast cancers and transmits signals mediating tumor
growth, invasion, and metastasis (Brenton et al., 2005). While
some patients afflicted with HER2+ breast cancer benefit from
anti-HER2 therapeutic treatment, others may either be unre-
sponsive or will develop resistance and relapse with a metastatic
disease (De Laurentiis et al., 2005; Mukohara, 2011). Hence,
defining the molecular mechanisms by which HER2 promotes
cancer spreading may reveal novel anti-metastatic therapeutic
strategies.
AXL, TYRO3, and MER collectively form the TAM family of
RTKs. Within this family, AXL is specifically activated by its ligand
GAS6 (Graham et al., 2014; Linger et al., 2008; O’Bryan et al.,
1991). While TAMs are dispensable for embryonic development,
their compound genetic deletions in mice revealed their essential
role in inhibiting innate immunity (Lemke and Rothlin, 2008; Roth-
lin et al., 2007). TAMs are frequently implicated in diseases, and
AXL is broadly expressed in solid cancers including breast can-
cer, non-small cell lung carcinoma, ovarian cancer, and clear cell
renal carcinoma where its levels correlate with increased risks of
metastasis (Gjerdrum et al., 2010; Lozneanu et al., 2016; Rankin
et al., 2010; Shieh et al., 2005; Yu et al., 2015). In addition, AXL
expression correlates with the acquisition of mesenchymal fea-
tures of cancer cells and provides advantages to tumors such
as increased invasion and resistance to antimitotic agents
in vitro (Asiedu et al., 2014; Gjerdrum et al., 2010; Vuoriluoto
et al., 2011; Wilson et al., 2014). Within breast cancer cell lines,
AXL expression is restricted to cells with the Triple-Negative

 gene signature, such that AXL is viewed as a marker of this
breast cancer subtype (D’Alfonso et al., 2014; Wilson et al.,
2014). Whether AXL is activated by GAS6 during cancer progres-
sion and metastasis remains unclear. GAS6 expression corre-
lates with positive outcome in breast cancer (Mc Cormack
et al., 2008) while it is linked to increased metastasis in non-small
cell lung cancer (Wu et al., 2017). AXL can also bypass the need
of GAS6 by cooperating with other transmembrane receptors
including EGFR, MET, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF),
and VEGFR-2 (Meyer et al., 2013; Ruan and Kazlauskas, 2012;
Salian-Mehta et al., 2013). In this study, we set out to develop
murine genetic models of AXL and GAS6 deletion to test their
role on metastasis in HER2+ breast cancer. We extended these
observations in tumor specimens and human cell lines, including
patient-derived xenografts (PDXs), and tested whether pharma-
cological inhibition of AXL could be a valid strategy to limit breast
cancer metastasis.
RESULTS
AXL Expression in HER2+ Breast Cancers Correlates
with Poor Patient Outcome
Because expression of AXL in human breast cancer is reported
to be limited to cell lines derived from TNBC patients (D’Alfonso
et al., 2014), AXL is currently viewed as a marker of the TNBC
molecular subtype (Leconet et al., 2016). Indeed, analysis of
RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data (Wilson et al., 2014) revealed
that only TNBC cell lines express high levels of AXL and this is
correlated with Vimentin (VIM) expression, suggesting that AXL
is expressed in cell lines displaying mesenchymal features (Fig-
ure S1A). However, analyses of the expression levels of AXL in
breast cancer patient samples has yielded conflicting data for
expression in molecular subtypes and for patient outcomes
(Gjerdrum et al., 2010; Jin et al., 2017; Wilson et al., 2014; Wu
et al., 2015). To resolve which breast cancer molecular subtypes
express AXL at the protein level, we stained a panel of tumor mi-
croarrays (TMA) (Yousef et al., 2014), derived from breast tumor
specimens linked with clinical data, using an AXL antibody that
had been validated for immunostaining on human samples (Wil-
son et al., 2014) and that we validated in this study (Figure S1B).
Unlike observations made in cell lines, these analyses revealed
that AXL expression was broadly detectable across breast can-
cer subtypes (Figures 1A and 1B). Furthermore, high expression
of AXL protein correlated with adverse clinical outcome when
data from all breast cancer subtypes were pooled (Figure S1C).
We sought to characterize the role of AXL in HER2+ breast can-
cers because this molecular subtype is aggressive and prone to
progress to a metastatic disease. We found that high AXL protein
levels correlated with lung and brain metastases in HER2+
patients (Figure 1C). We analyzed transcriptomics data linked
to clinical data of our cohort of HER2+ breast cancer patients
(GSE58644) and found that low expression of AXL correlated
with better survival (Figure 1D). Thus, high AXL expression in
HER2+ breast cancer unexpectedly correlates with increased
risk of metastasis and a reduced probability of survival.
Axl Promotes the Metastatic Progression of HER2+
Breast Cancer In Vivo Independently of Gas6
Because we found that AXL expression correlated with poor
outcome of HER2+ breast cancer patients, we used a murine
HER2+ breast cancer model to investigate the specific contribu-
tions of AXL and its ligand GAS6 in disease progression. Expres-
sion of a deletion mutant of the rat ortholog of HER2 targeted to
the mammary gland of mice using mouse mammary tumor virus
promoter (MMTV; NeuNDL2-5) results in tumors that progress to
invasive carcinoma and metastasize to lungs (Ursini-Siegel et al.,
2008). Transcriptomic data revealed that Axl and Gas6 were both
expressed in MMTV-NIC tumors (Laurin et al., 2013), suggesting
that this model would be useful to determine their functions
in vivo during HER2-driven breast cancer progression. After veri-
fying that mammary gland development occurred normally in
the absence of Axl or Gas6 (Figures S2A–S2C), we interbred
Axl and Gas6 germline knockout mice with MMTV-Neu animals
to generate five female cohorts: Neu+, Neu+:Axl+/�, Neu+:Axl�/�,
Neu+:Gas6+/�, and Neu+:Gas6�/� (Figure 1E). We reasoned that
these Axl and Gas6 knockout models would faithfully mimic an
effective systemic inhibition of this ligand/RTK pair. The mice
were monitored by weekly palpation to test for apparition of
tumors. We found that all genotypes developed mammary tu-
mors and noted a minor delay of tumor onset for Neu+:Axl�/� fe-
males, whereas Neu+:Gas6�/� mice presented no difference as
compared to the Neu+ control (Figure 1F). Five weeks after tumor
onset, the mice were sacrificed for characterization of tumor initi-
ation, tumor growth, and metastasis. To characterize the tumor
initiation process, we quantified the number of mammary intrae-
pithelial neoplastic lesions (MINs) on inguinal mammary glands.
Only Neu+:Axl�/� females presented an increased number of
MINs suggesting that neoplastic initiation occurs efficiently in
the absence of Axl (Figures S2D and S2E). Furthermore, all geno-
types bore tumors with a solid adenocarcinoma phenotype
(confirmed by a pathologist) suggesting that loss of Axl or
Gas6 did not alter the differentiation state of the tumors (Fig-
ure S2F). While loss of Axl did not alter the total tumor mass, a
small decrease was observed when Gas6 was ablated (Fig-
ure 1G). To assess the proliferative and apoptotic status of the
tumors, we stained them for Ki67 or cleaved-caspase 3, respec-
tively, and while we found no difference in proliferation or
apoptosis in Axl null tumors, tumors devoid of Gas6 showed
increased
apoptosis
(Figures
S2G–S2I).
This
increase
in
apoptosis was independently confirmed by TUNEL staining
and likely explained the decrease in tumor mass seen in Gas6
mutants (Figures S2J and S2K). Strikingly, Neu+:Axl�/� mice
(E) MMTV-Neu mice were crossed with AXL KO or GAS6 KO mice and the cohort was analyzed 5 weeks after tumor onset.

 exhibited a decrease in both the frequency and the total number
of lung metastatic lesions (Figures 1H, 1I, and S2L). In contrast,
ablation of Gas6 had no effect on the lung metastatic burden
(Figures 1H, 1I, and S2L). These data demonstrate an essential
and Gas6-independent contribution of Axl to the metastatic pro-
gression of HER2+ breast cancer.
HER2 Complexes with AXL to Promote Its Stability and
Recruitment at the Cell Surface
Because our mouse models revealed that Gas6 is dispensable
for the metastatic progression of HER2+ breast cancer, we
investigated the possibility of crosstalk between AXL and
HER2. We tested if AXL can co-immunoprecipitate with either
human HER2 or its splice variant HER2 D16 that is frequently ex-
pressed in human tumors (Kwong and Hung, 1998; Siegel et al.,
1999). An interaction between AXL and HER2 and HER2 D16 was
detected when the proteins were co-expressed in HEK293T cells
(Figure 2A). The interaction between AXL and HER2 was also
detectable both by co-immunoprecipitation and proximity liga-
tion assay (PLA) in MCF10A cells that stably express HER2
(Figures 2B and 2C). Furthermore, immunofluorescence re-
vealed that the AXL/HER2 complex is localized at cell edges in
MCF10A-HER2 cells (Figures 2C and S3A). An interaction be-
tween endogenous HER2 and AXL was also detectable in
SKBR3 cells (Figure S3B). Because all of the mouse models
and
mouse
cell
lines
used
in
this
study
exploit
either
NeuNDL2-5 or an activated mutant of Neu (NeuT; V664E
mutant), we tested whether these variants also interact with
AXL. We found that AXL co-precipitated with NeuT not only
when the proteins were co-expressed in HEK293T cells, but
also endogenously with NeuNDL2-5 in NIC cells (a cell line
derived from the MMTV-Neu-IRES-Cre mice) (Ursini-Siegel
et al., 2008) (Figures S3C and S3D). To test whether AXL was
also found in a complex with HER2 in tumors from HER2+ breast
cancer patients, we performed PLA experiments that revealed
the existence of AXL/HER2 complexes in human tumors (Fig-
ure 2D). In addition, immuno-staining for both proteins revealed
that a pool of AXL is co-localized with HER2 at the plasma mem-
brane in HER2+ tumor samples (Figure 2E).
To address the functional impact of HER2/AXL coupling, we
performed surface biotinylation experiments in MCF10A control
and MCF10A-HER2 cells to determine AXL protein levels at the
cell surface. These experiments revealed that HER2 expression
leads to a 3.4-fold increase in the cell surface pool of AXL, and
this enrichment occurs despite a decrease in the expression of
AXL and GAS6 at the mRNA levels (Figures 2F and S3E). Inter-
estingly, this HER2-mediated enrichment of AXL at the cell sur-
face was not dependent on the kinase activity of either AXL or
HER2 (Figure S3F). One possible explanation for the HER2-asso-
ciated increase in AXL at the cell surface is that HER2 affects the
trafficking of AXL and we therefore tested the localization of AXL
with late (Rab7+) or recycling (Rab11+) endosomes. Using an
AXL antibody that stained the intracellular pool of AXL, these ex-
periments revealed that in cells expressing HER2, the presence
of AXL decreased in Rab7+ late endosomes and increased in
Rab11+ recycling vesicles as compared to the control cells (Fig-
ures 2G, 2H, S3G, and S3H). To test whether the coupling of AXL
to HER2 might stabilize the protein, we performed cycloheximide
chase assays that revealed that the AXL protein is more stable in
MCF10A-HER2 (t1/2 = 5.13 hr) than in the control MCF10A cells
(t1/2 = 1.73 hr) (Figure 2I). Collectively, these results suggest
that AXL and HER2 form a physical complex that lead to
HER2-mediated stabilization of AXL and its enrichment at the
cell surface.
HER2 Transphosphorylates AXL to Promote Cancer Cell
Invasion
Because a proteomic screen of HER2 overexpression revealed
AXL as a candidate substrate (Bose et al., 2006), we hypothe-
sized that the formation of an AXL/HER2 complex might facilitate
transphosphorylation events between these RTKs. To test this,
we overexpressed the human HER2 D16 or NeuT together with
a kinase dead (KD) mutant of AXL in HEK293T cells. These
experiments revealed that both HER2 D16 and NeuT phos-
phorylate AXL KD in a HER2 kinase activity-dependent manner
because it was sensitive to the HER2 inhibitor lapatinib (Figures
3A and S4A). We next expressed HER2 D16 or NeuT in MDA-
MB-231 cells that express endogenous HER2 at very low levels
and AXL at high levels. We found that oncogenic HER2 variants
promoted the phosphorylation of endogenous AXL, and these
events were abrogated by inhibiting HER2 activity with lapatinib
(Figures 3B and S4B). We also tested whether AXL could pro-
mote the phosphorylation of HER2 in T47D luminal A cells, which
expresses HER2 but not AXL. In these cells, expression of exog-
enous AXL, which was found to be phosphorylated at basal
state, had no impact on HER2 phosphorylation (Figure 3C). Simi-
larly, inhibition of AXL with the small molecule inhibitor R428 in
the MCF10A-HER2, NIC, and SKBR3 cell lines had no impact
on the phosphorylation of HER2 on multiple tyrosine sites (Fig-
ure S4C). Interestingly, in T47D overexpressing AXL, addition
of lapatinib was sufficient to decrease AXL phosphorylation (Fig-
ure 3C), and this effect could be reproduced with MCF10A-
HER2, NIC, and SKBR3 cell lines (Figure S4E). We also found
that treatment of T47D cells with heregulin (HRG), a ligand of
the HER2/HER3 heterodimer, led to a further increase in AXL
phosphorylation (Figure 3C). We confirmed that lapatinib, at
the concentration used here (0.1–1 mM), showed no off-target
activity on AXL in a GAS6-mediated activation of AXL (Fig-
ure S4D). We subsequently investigated whether the co-inhibi-
tion of HER2 and AXL would have a functional impact on cell
invasion. While treatments with the HER2 blocking agents lapa-
tinib or herceptin (antibody) had no impact, the AXL inhibitor
R428 was sufficient to reduce cell invasion in MCF10A-HER2,
SKBR3, and NIC cells (Figures 3D–3G, S4F, and S4G). However,
(G and H) AXL is less present in late endosomes (Rab7+) (G) and enriched in recycling vesicles (Rab11+) (H) in MCF10A-HER2 cells. See also Figures S3G and S3H
(n = 15–25 cells). **p = 0.0013, **p = 0.0061.

Figure 3. HER2 Transactivates AXL to Promote Cell Invasion
(A) Overexpression of HER2D16 promotes the phosphorylation of AXL (kinase dead) and this is blocked by the HER2 inhibitor lapatinib (1 mM).
(B) Expression of HER2D16 in MDA-MB-231 cells promotes transactivation of endogenous AXL, which is blocked by lapatinib (1 mM) (n = 3). *p = 0.049.
(C) Expression of AXL in serum-starved T47D cells does not promote transactivation of endogenous HER2, but activation or inhibition of HER2 modulates AXL
phosphorylation (n = 3). Lapatinib (1 mM) **p = 0.002 and HRG (20 ng/mL) 20 min, **p = <0.0074.
(D–G) R428 (1 mm) and lapatinib (1 mM) or trastuzumab (10 mg/mL) cooperates to decrease MCF10A-HER2 (D and E) and NIC (F and G) cell invasion. Data are
represented as mean ± SEM, *p = 0.0117 and ***p < 0.0001.

 co-treatments of lapatinib or trastuzumab together with R428
robustly blocked invasion (Figures 3D–3G, S4F, and S4G).
Collectively, these data suggest that HER2 complexes with
AXL for its transphosphorylation that promotes cell invasion.
AXL Is Implicated in Multiple Steps of the Metastatic
Cascade
The generation of a Neu+:Axl�/� mouse model is the first bona
fide pre-clinical tool to dissect the roles of AXL at various steps
of the metastatic cascade in vivo. One of the potential limitations
of the Neu+:Axl�/� mouse model is that the global deletion of AXL
might also have an impact on the tumor microenvironment. We
therefore reconstituted NOD-SCID immune-compromised mice
with control or Axl null breast cancer cells to determine the tumor
cell intrinsic role of AXL. We generated two cohorts of mice that
conditionally express the Luciferase reporter in mammary
epithelial cells: NIC+:Rosa Lox-STOP-Lox Luciferase:Axl+/+ or
NIC+:Rosa Lox-STOP-Lox Luciferase:Axl�/�, and we derived
cell
explants
from
these
models
(NIC+:Luc+:Axl+/+
and
NIC+:Luc+:Axl�/�). When injected in mammary fat pads of
NOD-SCID mice, NIC+:Luc+:Axl�/� cells grew as primary tumors
as efficiently as the control cells (Figures 4A and 4B). Further-
more, at endpoint, 2/10 mice grafted with NIC+:Luc+:Axl�/� cells
showed lung metastasis while 7/10 mice grafted with the control
cells developed metastases (Figure 4C). These results demon-
strate that AXL expressed in the HER2 transformed mammary
epithelial cells promotes metastasis but is dispensable for tumor
growth.
We next investigated the contribution of AXL in cancer cells
at different steps of the metastatic cascade including intra-
vasation, extravasation, and survival/growth at the metastatic
site. To assess the potential of AXL to promote intravasation,
we implanted NIC+:Luc+:Axl+/+ or NIC+:Luc+:Axl�/� cells in
mammary fat pads of NOD-SCID mice and quantified the
circulating tumor cells (CTCs) when the primary tumors had
reached a 1.5 cm diameter (Figure 4D). We also quantified
the CTCs directly from the NIC+ and NIC+:Axl�/� transgenic
models 5 weeks after tumor onset (Figure 4D). NOD-SCID
mice bearing NIC+:Luc+:Axl�/� tumors as well as NIC+:Axl�/�
transgenic mice presented with only a few CTCs in comparison
to their respective control animals (Figures 4E and 4F). These
results suggest that the AXL protein is a major contributor of
intravasation.
We subsequently conducted an experimental metastasis
assay by injecting NIC+:Luc+:Axl+/+ or NIC+:Luc+:Axl�/� cells
directly in the lateral tail vein of NOD-SCID mice, therefore
bypassing the intravasation process (Figure 4G). While both
cell models were retained in the lungs 1 hr post-injection, Axl�/�
cells produced noticeably less metastatic lesions than the con-
trol cells 30 days post-injection (Figures 4H–4J). We designed
an assay to specifically measure the extravasation potential of
Axl null cells by injecting fluorescently stained NIC+:Luc+:Axl+/+
or NIC+:Luc+:Axl�/� cells in the lateral tail vein of NOD-SCID
mice. Two days later, Rhodamine-labeled lectin was injected
to stain the blood vessels and lungs were collected and
sectioned to measure the ability of cells to enter the lung tissue
(Figure 4K). These experiments revealed a decreased ability of
Axl null cells to exit the blood vessels and invade into the lung pa-
renchyma (Figure 4L-M). To test whether AXL is also required in
the cancer cells to promote survival and growth at the metastatic
site, we developed a conditional AXL-depletion assay by gener-
ating NIC+:Luc+ cells stably expressing 2 independent and Tet-
inducible small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) against Axl (Figure 4N).
We performed an experimental metastasis assay and waited
for 2 days for the cells to extravasate into the lungs prior to treat-
ing the mice with doxycycline for 28 days to induce Axl knock-
downs (Figure 4O). Cells in which Axl was conditionally depleted
grew significantly less at the metastatic site than the ones ex-
pressing a non-targeting shRNA (Figures 4P and 4R). Collec-
tively, these data suggest that AXL is continuously required in
HER2+ cancer cells for efficient metastasis.
AXL Regulates Transforming Growth Factor b-Induced
Cell Invasion of HER2+ Breast Cancer Cells
To gain mechanistic insights into the poor metastatic potential
of Axl null tumors, we performed a transcriptomic analysis. We
first conducted RNA-sequencing experiments using RNA iso-
lated from Neu+:Axl+/+ or Neu+:Axl�/� tumors grown as grafts
and identified the differentially expressed genes. Gene Ontology
analysis revealed that Axl�/� tumors displayed a decrease in
expression of genes involved in pathways mediating Integrin,
EGF, Rho-GTPase, and transforming growth factor b (TGF-b)
signaling (Figure 5A) as compared to Axl-expressing tumors.
These analyses also identified biological processes downregu-
lated following the loss of AXL, including extracellular matrix
organization, cell migration, cytoskeleton organization, and
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (Figure 5B). Further-
more, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) suggested that AXL
acts on TGF-b signaling, EMT, and cell migration (Figures 5C,
and 5D; Table S1). Additionally, gene sets from focal adhesion,
stem cell, and HER2 signaling were also decreased in Axl�/� tu-
mor grafts (Figures S5A–S5D). Similar GSEA signatures were

 identified when RNA was isolated from tumors from Neu+:Axl+/+
or Neu+:Axl�/� transgenic mice (Figures S5E–S5H; Table S1).
These analyses suggest that AXL may promote metastasis by
controlling cell migration and invasion in the context of EMT/
TGF-b signaling. We investigated the activation status of a panel
of proteins involved in cell migration using activation state-
specific antibodies. Tissue lysates from Neu+:Axl�/� tumors
displayed a reduction of pSrc, pFAK, p-p130Cas, and pAKT sug-
gesting that migration pathways are impaired when AXL is
absent (Figure S5I). Interestingly, ablation of Gas6 had no
impact
on
the
activation
status
of
these
pro-migration
proteins (Figure S5I). Other signaling intermediates, pSTAT3,
pSTAT1, or pERK, were unaffected by deletion of Axl or Gas6
(Figure S5I).
Previous work has shown that TGF-b promotes the formation
of metastases in vivo in Neu+ breast cancer models (Siegel
et al., 2003), and the plasticity of EMT is important for efficient
metastasis (Lambert et al., 2017; Li and Kang, 2016; Aceto
et al., 2015; Tsai and Yang, 2013). Because our transcriptomics
experiments indicated that deletion of AXL in Neu+ tumors alters
their EMT status, we hypothesized that AXL is required to pro-
mote EMT-induced cell migration and invasion. To test this, we
exposed a panel of HER2+ breast cancer cell models (NIC,
MCF10A-HER2, andSKBR3) to TGF-b to reprogram them toward
EMT. As expected, TGF-b stimulation increased cell invasion,
which could be blunted either by treatment with R428, by inter-
fering with AXL expression using either RNAi or genetic knockout
(Figures 5E–5H and S6A–S6L; Video S1). Treatment of the non-
transformed MCF10A cells with TGF-b increased AXL expres-
sion, its phosphorylation, the expression of EMT markers, and
increased cell migration and invasion (Figures 5E, 5F, S6C, and
S6D). In this model, interfering with AXL activity (R428) or expres-
sion (small interfering RNA [siRNA]) abolished TGF-b-induced
cell migration and invasion and this effect was more striking in
MCF10A-HER2 in comparison to MCF10A cells (Figures 5E, 5F,
and S6A–S6D). Furthermore, TGF-b failed to induce invasion of
NIC+:Axl�/� or NIC+:shAXL cells, and this phenotype could be
rescued by re-expression of AXL (Figures 5G, 5H, S6K, and
S6L). To test whether AXL contributes to TGF-b-induced invasion
in vivo, we conducted an extravasation assay similar to the one
described in Figure 4K. While pre-treatment of Neu+:Axl+/+ cells
enhanced their invasion in the lung, TGF-b had no effect on the
extravasation potential of Neu+:Axl�/� in vivo (Figure 5I). These
results suggest that AXL plays a critical role in EMT/TGF-
b-induced cell invasion of HER2+ breast cancer cells in vivo.
AXL Is a Critical Effector of EMT for Invasion of Human
HER2+ Breast Cancers
We next investigated whether the EMT/TGF-b/AXL interplay
contributes to human HER2+ breast cancer progression. Unlike
in human tumors (Figure 1), AXL is not significantly expressed
in human HER2+ breast cancer cell lines (Figure S1A). We
used the human HER2+ breast cancer cell line HCC1954 and
confirmed that AXL expression is increased upon TGF-b treat-
ment (Figures 6A and S7A). In this context, interfering with AXL
activity (R428) or expression (siRNA) abolished TGF-b-induced
cell migration and invasion (Figures 6A, 6B, and S7A–S7C).
We found that AXL expressed following TGF-b treatment of
HCC1954 cells enters in complex with HER2 by PLA (Figure 6C).
We also observed that AXL phosphorylation is decreased
following treatment with lapatinib in TGF-b-treated HCC1954
cells (Figure 6D). While R428 decreased the invasiveness of
HCC1954 cells stimulated with TGF-b, the combination of
R428 with the HER2 targeting agents lapatinib or trastuzumab
further blocked this phenotype (Figure 6E). Furthermore, we
derived a cell line from a HER2+ PDX initially isolated as a brain
metastasis. In agreement with the observations from a panel of
human HER2+ cell lines, AXL is not expressed in the HER2+
PDX cells, but its expression, along with EMT markers, is
induced following TGF-b stimulation (Figures 6F and S7D). While
TGF-b treatment robustly induced cell invasion and migration of
the PDX cells, interfering with AXL activity (R428) or expression
(shAXL) blunted these effects (Figures 6F, 6G, and S7D–S7F;
Video S2). Interestingly, AXL induced after TGF-b treatment of
the PDX-derived cells formed a complex with HER2 (Figure 6H).
The combination of R428 with lapatinib or trastuzumab in this
context also blocked cell invasion in comparison to each agent
alone (Figure 6I).
We next investigated if AXL expression in HER2+ breast can-
cer samples correlates with the EMT status of the tumors and
found that AXL expression inversely correlated with the epithelial
marker E-Cadherin and correlated with the mesenchymal marker
Slug (Figure 6J). To confirm the correlation between AXL expres-
sion and the EMT status of the tumors, we mined the transcrip-
tomic data of our cohort of HER2+ breast cancer patient samples
and these analyses demonstrated that high expression of the
AXL mRNA strongly correlates with TGF-b gene signatures in
HER2+ tumors (Figure 6K). Immunofluorescence showed cancer
cells to be positive for both pSmad2 and AXL (Figure S7G),
thereby confirming that this signature is present in the cancer
cells, and not only in the stroma. Our results in mouse models
and human samples highlight a role for AXL in the maintenance
of the EMT program and demonstrate that EMT/TGF-b signaling
promotes AXL expression that mediates invasion breast cancer
cells.
Pharmacological Inhibition of AXL Reduces the
Metastatic Progression of HER2+ Breast Cancer
Because our results support a role for AXL in promoting metas-
tasis of HER2+ breast cancer, we tested whether pharmacolog-
ical inhibition of AXL might be a viable anti-metastatic treatment.
We used a tumorsphere model in which the ability of cancer cells
with stem-like properties to form tumorspheres in vitro is a reflec-
tion of their capacity to form tumors de novo or at the metastatic
(G and H) NIC cells undergo EMT upon treatment with TGF-b and the inhibition of AXL abrogates TGF-b-induced cell invasion (G). TGF-b-induced cell invasion in
Axl-depleted cells was rescued with exogenous Axl expression (H). Data are represented as mean ± SEM, ***p < 0.0001.
(I) TGF-b-induced cell extravasation in vivo is abrogated in NIC+:Axl�/� cells (n = 5 mice). **p = 0.0036, ***p < 0.0001.

patinib or trastuzumab reduced tumorsphere formation of our
HER2+ PDX cells, while R428 had a modest effect (Figures 7A
and 7B). The combination of both AXL and HER2 inhibitors blunt-
ed the formation of tumorspheres (Figures 7A and 7B). In order to
provide proof-of-principle that inhibition of AXL in vivo decreases
metastatic burden, we used the MMTV-NIC mouse model of
HER2+ breast cancer. Cohorts of females were treated daily
with either R428 or vehicle for 5 weeks after the appearance
of the first palpable tumors. Prolonged exposure to R428
decreased AXL phosphorylation and also led to an upregulation
of AXL (Figure S7H). At the end of the experiment, multiple tumor
progression parameters were analyzed, and we determined
that prolonged in vivo AXL inhibition mimicked its genetic
deletion. Although we found no difference in the proliferation
(Ki67), apoptosis (cleaved-caspase 3) or the total tumor mass

 of R428-treated mice in comparison to mice that received
vehicle alone (Figures 7C and S7I–S7L), R428 administration
decreased the number of CTCs and the total lung metastatic
burden of MMTV-NIC animals (Figures 7D and 7E). In summary,
we report a preclinical model demonstrating that AXL is essential
for the metastatic progression of HER2+ breast cancer in vivo,
and we suggest that AXL inhibition could be a powerful approach
to limit metastatic spreading.
DISCUSSION
AXL expression is primarily limited to breast cancer cell lines
representative of the triple-negative molecular subtypes, and
virtually no expression is detectable in luminal or HER2+ cell lines
(D’Alfonso et al., 2014; Wilson et al., 2014). An emerging feature
of AXL expression across multiple solid tumor cell lines is the link
with EMT (i.e., cells expressing mesenchymal markers) (Antony
et al., 2016; Wilson et al., 2014). These data have led to the
establishment of AXL as a candidate marker of TNBC. In this
study, we demonstrate that AXL is expressed in a subset of
HER2+ human breast cancers that display an EMT signature
and this is linked to poor clinical outcome. Based on these
data, we sought to determine if AXL plays a functional role and
if it is an actionable target during HER2+ breast cancer progres-
sion. Through a series of genetic and functional assays, we
demonstrate a central role for AXL in promoting metastasis in
the context of HER2+ breast cancer.
An AXL decoy receptor with enhanced GAS6-binding proper-
ties, MYD1, was engineered as a therapeutic tool to disrupt
GAS6/AXL signaling in vivo (Kariolis et al., 2014). MYD1 was
shown to block metastasis of human ovarian cancer cells and
a murine breast cancer cell line in grafting assays in mice. These
data led to the notion that targeting GAS6 might be a novel
approach to limit metastasis. In contrast, by using a genetic
approach to characterize a pre-clinical breast cancer model,
we found that GAS6, but not AXL, was dispensable for HER2-
driven metastasis in vivo. These findings not only demonstrate
that autocrine secretion of GAS6 from cancer cells is not
required for metastasis, but also that GAS6 expressed in the
lungs is not acting as a homing factor for the cancer cells in
this model. Rather, AXL appears to physically interact with
HER2, thereby bypassing the necessity for GAS6, and this leads
to HER2-mediated transphosphorylation and activation of AXL
that triggers cell invasion. Recent data suggest that AXL hetero-
dimerization with other transmembrane receptors occurs in mul-
tiple pathophysiological contexts (Meyer et al., 2013; Ruan and
Kazlauskas, 2012; Salian-Mehta et al., 2013). Our results provide
mechanistic details demonstrating that the interaction of AXL
with HER2 increases both AXL half-life and its localization at
the cell surface. Interestingly, the formation of HER2/EGFR het-
erodimers has also been reported to stabilize EGFR at the cell
surface leading to enhanced oncogenic signaling (Hendriks
et al., 2003; Lenferink et al., 1998). Hence, ligand-independent
activation of AXL could be a common event in cancers driven
by RTKs. One implication of our findings is that determining
the GAS6-dependency of tumors for metastasis may be impor-
tant before considering therapeutic approaches that target the
GAS6/AXL interaction. Unlike in humans, our murine models
have the limitation that metastasis only occurs to lungs, therefore
we cannot exclude the possibility that GAS6 could be important
in controlling metastasis to other organs. In prostate cancer
models, GAS6 expressed by the bone promotes a tumor cell
dormancy state (Shiozawa et al., 2010). It will be important to
determine if GAS6 is important for bone metastasis because it
is a frequent site of dissemination in HER2+ breast cancer pa-
tients. In addition, PROTEIN S (PROS1), a GAS6-related protein
that preferentially activates TYRO3 and MERTK over AXL (Linger
et al., 2008), is also expressed in murine HER2+ tumors. Whether
dual targeting of GAS6 and PROS1 would impact AXL-mediated
metastasis remains to be tested.
The plasticity of EMT is critical to allow for efficient metastasis
(Li and Kang, 2016; Aceto et al., 2015). Acquisition of EMT
features facilitates migration within the primary tumor and
intravasation (Giampieri et al., 2009), prepares the cells in the
circulation for extravasation (Labelle et al., 2011), and is required
for extravasation (Padua and Massague
´ , 2009). AXL is frequently
expressed in cancer cells of various origins that display mesen-
chymal features (Gjerdrum et al., 2010; Wu et al., 2014). While
there is now substantial evidence to suggest that AXL is a pro-
moter of metastasis in solid cancers, its contributions to the
various steps of the metastatic process as an effector of EMT
and throughout the metastatic cascade have not been dissected.
While HER2+ cancers retain epithelial features, the progression to
the metastatic stage is thought to require EMT (Wu et al., 2016).
We report here that AXL is essential for the intravasation of
HER2+ cancer cells, as measured by quantifying the CTCs in
both immune-competent and immune-compromised mice. We
confirmed the contribution of AXL to EMT-induced invasion in
multiple models, in particular using a human the HER2+ cell line
HCC1954 and the HER2+ PDX cell. Interestingly, the HER2+
PDX cells used in this study does not express AXL and mesen-
chymal markers in basal conditions like other HER2+ breast can-
cer cell lines studied to date (D’Alfonso et al., 2014; Wilson et al.,
2014), unless they are reprogrammed by TGF-b. We also found
that AXL is a mediator of TGF-b-induced extravasation of HER2+
cancer cells. Hence, AXL may be needed to allow for efficient
TGF-b-reprogramming of cells for extravasation. Our findings
that AXL is essential for extravasation in HER2+ cancer cells are
in agreement with several experimental metastasis assays that
have suggested a role for AXL in the extravasation of triple-nega-
tive breast cancer cells (Vuoriluoto et al., 2011). However, the ma-
jor difference is that triple-negative breast cancer cells are initially
mesenchymal and express high AXL while HER2+ cells must un-
dergo EMT for AXL expression and AXL-mediated extravasation.
By performing knockdown of AXL once HER2+ cancer cells
have achieved lung colonization, we demonstrated that AXL
contributes to the establishment of macrometastases. While in-
hibition of AXL impairs the efficiency of metastasis, the later
finding has major clinical implications since pharmacological in-
hibition of AXL even at later stages may have the potential to
reduce metastatic outgrowth. A recent study using tumor initi-
ating cells from PyMT transgenic mouse tumors that display par-
tial EMT (AXL+) suggested that AXL, by promoting the secretion
of THBS2 and activation of fibroblasts, prepares the metastatic
niche (Del Pozo Martin et al., 2015). We found that THBS2 was
downregulated in the Axl�/� tumors (Figure 5D), in agreement
1488
Cell Reports 23, 1476–1490, May 1, 2018
 with a role for AXL in the niche activation. These data support the
notion that inhibition of AXL in HER2+ breast cancer dampens
the efficiency of every step of the metastatic cascade.
Most patients afflicted with HER2+ breast cancer undergo first
line therapy with agents that target HER2. We tested the effect of
prolonged systemic pharmacological inhibition of AXL and found
that R428 treatments phenocopied the genetic deletion of AXL,
i.e., a decrease in both CTCs and lung metastases with no effect
on primary tumor growth. Furthermore, co-treatment with R428
and HER2 blocking agents inhibited HER2+ PDX tumorspheres
growth. Collectively, our data demonstrate that anti-AXL therapy
is sufficient to reduce metastasis in HER2+ cancers in experi-
mental models. It will be key to define pre-clinical conditions to
determine if co-targeting of HER2 and AXL affects tumor growth,
intravasation and extravasation, and survival of the DTCs.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Tumor Microarrays
A cohort of 300 female breast cancer patients comprising ductal and medullary
tumors specimen of different histological grades was used in the retrospective
study. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples containing tumor
tissues were collected for the study and prepared as tumor microarrays
(TMA) at IRIC Histology core facility. Tumor grades were confirmed using the
Modified Scarff-Bloom-Richardson-Elston-Ellis grading system. Information
on the TMA and the follow-up data, including the onset of metastasis and
relapse are described in Yousef et al. (2014). The Human Ethics Committee
of the Universite
´ de Montre
´ al Hospital Center (3SL05.019) approved the use
of these specimens and research data.
