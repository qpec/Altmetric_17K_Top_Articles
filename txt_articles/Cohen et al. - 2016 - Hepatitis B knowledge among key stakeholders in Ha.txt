Abstract
Background: This article describes hepatitis B-related knowledge, attitudes and practices after completion of the
Gateway to Care campaign, a citywide public health education program that targeted city residents, health care
providers and individuals chronically infected with hepatitis B virus in Haimen City, China.
Methods: Pre/post questionnaires assessed hepatitis B knowledge change among health care providers and
post-campaign surveys evaluated hepatitis B knowledge, attitudes and behaviors (including stigma-related beliefs
and practices) among health care providers, city residents and chronically infected individuals. Focus groups were
conducted to gain a more in-depth understanding of the needs of the target communities, and to identify future
intervention strategies to improve hepatitis B testing and linkage to care and treatment.
Results: Results indicate high levels of hepatitis B knowledge among multiple stakeholders in Haimen City, with
significant knowledge improvement among health care providers. Stigma-related beliefs and myths regarding
separation of infected individuals from certain aspects of family life were common among all stakeholder groups,
despite high levels of accurate knowledge about hepatitis B transmission and prevention. Self-report of hepatitis B
screening was low among city residents, as was awareness of hepatitis B treatment.
Conclusions: More efforts are needed to improve awareness of HBV treatment, decrease HBV-related stigma,
improve screening rates, and reduce cost of antiviral treatment. Future interventions in Haimen City should be
driven by behavioral change theory, to not only improve knowledge, but to improve screening behaviors and
address hepatitis B-related stigma and discrimination.

Background
An estimated 248 million individuals worldwide are
chronically infected with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) [1].
Approximately 40 % live in China, where an estimated
100 million people are chronically infected, and where
up to 500,000 people die annually from HBV-related
complications, including primary liver cancer (hepatocel-
lular carcinoma [HCC]) [2-5]. In China, most infection
occurs at birth (perinatal transmission) or during early
childhood, leading to high rates of chronic infection
[4, 5]. The high prevalence of chronic HBV infection
in China has yielded a high burden of HBV-related
HCC incidence and mortality, with 55 % of liver
cancer deaths worldwide occurring in China [6]. HBV
immunization programs administered by the Chinese
Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization
(WHO), including the universal vaccination of newborns
program begun in 1992, have improved HBV vaccine
coverage in parts of China, which is reflected in a
recent decline of prevalence rates [7, 8]. However,
HBV vaccination does not help those who are already

 infected, and chronic HBV infection is still a consid-
erable health issue in China with a serious public
health impact.
The key to reducing morbidity and mortality associ-
ated with chronic HBV infection is improving rates of
HBV screening and ensuring that infected individuals
receive appropriate medical management [9, 10]. This is
especially needed in areas that have high HBV preva-
lence and HCC incidence. However, multiple barriers
result in low levels of screening, diagnosis, care and
treatment for HBV. Key barriers to screening and
vaccination include geography (i.e. rural areas), limited
knowledge among the general population and health
care providers, and HBV-related stigma [7, 9, 11, 12-14].
Treatment
uptake
is
also
low,
primarily
due
to
under-diagnosis and cost of antiviral treatment [15].
To help overcome barriers to HBV screening, the
Hepatitis
B
Foundation
(HBF)
implemented
the
“Gateway to Care Campaign: Haimen City Project” in
August 2010, in collaboration with the Haimen City
Center for Disease Control and Prevention (HCCDC)
[16]. This 3-year project is described in detail in a
previous publication [16]. Briefly, the project con-
sisted of a targeted citywide public health information
and awareness campaign, specialized education and
training for key constituencies (including health care
providers, government officials and infected individ-
uals), and expansions in health care infrastructure to in-
crease
screening,
vaccination,
treatment,
and
care
management services.
This article describes HBV-related knowledge, atti-
tudes and practices among key Haimen City constituen-
cies (city residents, health care providers and infected
individuals), as well as knowledge change among health
care providers after implementation of the Gateway to
Care program. The study also identifies potentially ef-
fective strategies that could be implemented in the
future to improve HBV screening and care rates in
Haimen City. Thus, these findings may guide the design
of future interventions.
Methods
Haimen City, China
Haimen City, which has a population of 1.03 million,
is located in Jiangsu Province, approximately 60 miles
northwest of Shanghai. HCC has been the leading
cause of cancer death in Haimen City since death
registration began in 1970, and the incidence and
mortality of HCC in Haimen City are among the
highest in China, and in the world (Haimen City
CDC Vital Statistics, unpublished data). City public
health
officials
estimate
that
there
are
currently
80,000 residents aged 25 to 64 living with chronic
HBV infection [16]. A population-based prospective
cohort study enrolling more than 90,000 Haimen City
residents found a 13.7 % chronic HBV infection rate.
This study, which has been following infected individ-
uals since 1992, established a direct link between viral
load and liver cancer in chronically infected individ-
uals [17]. The Gateway to Care campaign, designed
by the HBF and HCCDC, grew out of the need for
improved knowledge, screening and access to care in
Haimen City. HBF, founded in 1991, is a United
States-based non-profit organization engaged in scien-
tific and public health research, education and patient
advocacy.
Gateway to care awareness and education program
methodology
A multi-platform education and awareness campaign for
the general public consisted of print media (newspapers,
brochures, direct home mailings), community awareness
events, and free educational giveaway products such as
playing cards, drinking cups and calendars. All platforms
provided information on HBV transmission, prevention,
testing and treatment, as well as healthy lifestyle behaviors.
In addition, educational messages highlighted the import-
ance of being tested for HBV and the need for chronically
infected individuals to receive regular check-ups to monitor
liver disease progression. Another educational aim was to
debunk common myths about HBV transmission, for
example by explaining that HBV is not transmitted through
casual contact or sharing eating utensils.
In addition to the public information and awareness
campaign, 52 in-person educational seminars were
provided for key constituencies. The seminars tar-
geted citywide township government officials, village
community leaders, township and village doctors, and
chronically infected HBV patients hospitalized in the
Haimen City People’s Hospital. The seminars were led
by trained educators from HCCDC and infectious
disease specialists from the People’s Hospital. Each
seminar lasted for at least 1 h and focused on increasing
knowledge about HBV transmission, prevention, testing,
and appropriate medical management and treatment
(including screening for early detection of HCC). A pri-
mary goal of the seminars was to encourage appropriate
testing and referral to care, as per published clinical
guidelines [18]. More than 90 % of targeted health care
providers (1441) attended these educational seminars,
including medical doctors, obstetricians, nurse assistants,
school nurses, and public health officials from the 23
townships and 239 villages that comprise Haimen City.
Program evaluation focused on HBV-related know-
ledge, attitudes and practices of health care providers,
city residents, and infected individuals. Due to logistical
constraints, government officials were not a focus of the
evaluation.

 evaluation: an assessment of change in knowledge, atti-
tudes and behaviors among health care providers who
attended in-person educational seminars; and an assess-
ment of post-campaign knowledge, attitudes and behav-
iors among random samples of health care providers,
city residents and chronically infected individuals.
Data collection and analysis
To assess changes in knowledge before and after in-
person seminars, health care providers were asked to
complete a seven-item self-administered pre/post ques-
tionnaire. The pre/post questionnaire measured baseline
knowledge and knowledge change immediately after
seminar attendance in the following HBV-related do-
mains: transmission, prevention, diagnosis, symptomol-
ogy, epidemiology and treatment (Table 1, Additional
file 1). A total of 710 providers completed the pre-
questionnaire and 680 completed the post-questionnaire.
To protect privacy and encourage participation, the pre-
and post-questionnaires for individual participants were
not linked. Results were analyzed using SAS v. 9.3 (Cary,
NC). Poisson regression was used to examine stratum-
specific differences in frequency of correct answers to
the pre- and post-questionnaires by sex, age group, and
educational level.
Additionally, a post-campaign survey was conducted
among random samples of health care providers (n = 227),
Haimen City residents (n = 249), and chronically infected
individuals (n = 20). These self-administered paper surveys
evaluated HBV-related knowledge, attitudes and behav-
iors, including stigma-related beliefs and practices (Table 1,
Additional file 1). Health care provider survey participants
were recruited throughout the city, and city residents were
recruited from two randomly selected villages. Chronically
HBV-infected individuals were recruited from the Haimen
City People’s Hospital. The surveys were analyzed using
Microsoft Excel to calculate the percentage of correct re-
sponses on the HBV knowledge questions and the per-
centages of similar responses, by group, on the attitude
and practice questions.
Six focus groups were conducted to gain a more in-
depth understanding of how well the Gateway to Care
campaign had met the needs of the target communities
and to identify future intervention strategies for improv-
ing HBV testing, care and treatment. Focus groups were
led by trained facilitators from HCCDC, and participants
were recruited by HCCDC project staff.
Two focus groups were conducted with a total of 14
health care providers from two randomly selected town-
ships. The providers were asked to comment on their
preferred methods for receiving HBV education, strategies
for improving HBV testing among community members,
and strategies for promoting routine check-ups and anti-
viral treatment for chronically HBV-infected individuals.
Two focus groups were conducted with a total of 15 city
residents from two villages. These focus groups addressed
methods for improving HBV awareness and HBV screen-
ing at the community level. Two focus groups were
conducted with a total of 20 chronic HBV patients at the
People’s Hospital, with patients asked for their perspec-
tives on strategies for encouraging completion of check-
ups and uptake of oral antiviral treatment. All focus
groups were conducted in Chinese. All sessions were
recorded, and notes were taken by the facilitators.
Transcripts were translated into English for analysis.

with the text [19]. The process included multiple read-
ings of the focus group transcripts to become familiar
with the domains and themes of the text. A coding table
was created to separate questions and responses into
distinct domains for each of the three types of partici-
pants (providers, city residents and HBV-infected indi-
viduals) (Table 2). Coding of the text took place in two
phases: open and selective coding. Open coding helped
to identify themes and summarize the data generally.
Selective coding was then used to code data related to
the
identified
domains/variables.
Memo-writing
was
used throughout the coding process to highlight key
themes and relationships that were being identified
within the text.

Results
HBV-related knowledge change among health care
providers who attended seminars
A total of 710 health care providers completed the HBV
knowledge pre-test, 50.8 % of whom were male. The
median age of the pre-test group was 45 (range 24–68).
A total of 680 providers completed the HBV knowledge
post-test, of whom 51.2 % were male. The median age of
the post-test group was 46 (range 24–68). Neither age
nor gender differed significantly between the pre- and
post-test groups.
Respondents correctly answered 67.3 % of the pre-test
questions and 85.9 % of the post-test questions, indicating
an overall knowledge increase of 18.6 % (p < 0.0001)
(Table 3). Male providers correctly answered 68.1 % of the
pre-test questions and 85.6 % of the post-test questions,
indicating a knowledge increase of 17.4 % (p < 0.0001)
(Table 4). Female providers correctly answered 66.4 % of
the pre-test questions and 86.3 % of the post-test ques-
tions, indicating a knowledge increase of 19.9 % (p < 0.01).
There were significant knowledge increases for all age
groups except the group aged 65 and older. Addition-
ally, there were significant knowledge increases for
those who had completed high school or less (14.4 %,
p < 0.01) and those who had completed junior college
(20.8 %, p < 0.0001). There was an 18.3 % knowledge in-
crease among the small number of providers who had
completed college (p = 0.06). Results of the Poisson regres-
sion indicate that controlling for age, gender and educa-
tion (individually and together) did not change the
estimate of the pre/post effect on HBV knowledge overall.
Post-campaign knowledge, attitudes and practices among
health care providers
Of the 226 health care providers who completed the post-
campaign questionnaire, 46.5 % were female and the mean
age was 41 (age range 22–68). Nineteen percent had a
high school education or less, 32.7 % had completed
junior college, 20.8 % had completed college and 27.4 %
had post-college secondary education. A total of 93.4 % of
providers stated that they had received HBV education
within the past 2 years. A total of 94.7 % correctly answered
the questionnaire’s transmission question, 100 % correctly
answered the HBV testing/diagnosis question, 88.5 %
correctly answered the prevention question, and 93.8 %
correctly answered the treatment question (Table 5).
Most providers (75.2 %) responded that it is necessary
to test patients for HBV regardless of symptoms, while
24.3 % felt that it is important to test only patients who
are symptomatic. Eighty percent reported that they
tested their patients for HBV, 76.1 % reported suggesting
to their patients that they be tested, and 85.8 % stated
that they provide HBV education to their patients.

 Ninety-six percent of providers believed that infected indi-
viduals need regular check-ups, and 95.0 % advised their
asymptomatic patients to get regular check-ups. While
97.8 % of providers agreed that it was important for
treatment candidates to receive treatment, only 65.5 % of
them reported suggesting treatment to their asymptomatic
treatment candidates. Almost all providers (97.0 %) felt that
individuals who are susceptible to HBV should be vacci-
nated, particularly if they have an infected family member,
and 95.1 % reported recommending HBV vaccination to
susceptible persons.
Health care providers participating in focus groups
indicated that individualized, in-person, small group
educational sessions were an effective way to acquire
knowledge about HBV prevention and control. Providers
also felt that a multi-platform strategy was the best way to
improve HBV knowledge and awareness among members
of the public. Suggested strategies for building public
awareness included delivering HBV messages through mass
media (potentially TV, newspapers and social media),
community seminars, and in-person education by village
doctors. Providers stressed the importance of repetitive
messaging. Reducing the cost of laboratory tests was seen
as the most important strategy for encouraging routine
check-ups among HBV-infected individuals. Offering free
treatment as well as educating infected patients about the
consequences of HBV and about available treatment
options were noted as ways to encourage treatment candi-
dates to seek HBV treatment.

 Post-campaign knowledge, attitudes and practices among
city residents
Of the 249 city residents who completed the post-
campaign questionnaire, 55.8 % were female and the
mean age was 48 (age range 18–88). Forty-nine percent
had a middle-school education or less, 15.7 % had com-
pleted high school, 8.8 % had completed junior college
or college, 2.0 % had post-secondary education, and
1.6 % had no formal education. About half (47.8 %) indi-
cated that they had received some type of HBV educa-
tion/information in the previous 2 years. A total of
85.9 % people correctly answered the questionnaire’s
transmission question, 84.3 % correctly answered the
HBV diagnosis question, 80.7 % correctly answered the
prevention question, and 57.8 % correctly answered the
treatment question (Table 5). Just over half of respon-
dents (56.6 %) felt that it is either better, or necessary,
for an HBV-infected individual to use separate utensils,
and 24.9 % stated that they have tried to keep their dis-
tance from infected individuals because of fear of getting
infected. The majority (67.5 %) believed that it is neces-
sary to be tested for HBV, but only 35.3 % reported that
they had ever been tested. Sixty-four percent of respon-
dents felt that individuals who are susceptible to HBV
should be vaccinated, and 42.2 % stated that they had
been vaccinated. Eight percent did not know their HBV
vaccination status. More than two-thirds of people
(67.5 %) felt that infected individuals should have regular
check-ups, and 75.9 % felt that treatment candidates
should receive treatment even if they are asymptomatic.
The city residents who participated in the focus groups
preferred to receive HBV health messaging through re-
petitive television seminars and face-to-face talks with
their doctors. They believed that there was a need for
people to have repeated exposure to HBV education ra-
ther than just hearing the messages once. They thought
that
improving
HBV
knowledge
through
education
would encourage people to get tested, especially if free
testing was available. Providing free or subsidized HBV
treatment and educating people about the consequences
of untreated HBV infection were thought to be effective
strategies for encouraging infected individuals (including
those who are asymptomatic) to seek treatment.
Post-campaign knowledge, attitudes and practices among
chronically infected individuals
Of the 20 HBV-infected individuals who completed the
post-campaign questionnaire, 65.0 % were female and
the mean age was 58 (age range 44–68). Thirty-five per-
cent had completed elementary school, 55.0 % had com-
pleted middle school, and 10.0 % had completed high
school. All (100 %) correctly answered the question-
naire’s HBV testing/diagnosis question, 88.5 % correctly
answered the prevention question, and 93.8 % correctly
answered the treatment question (Table 5). Almost all
(95.0 %) correctly identified HBV transmission routes,
while all (100.0 %) knew that a blood test was the only
way to diagnose an HBV infection. Ninety-five percent
were aware that the HBV vaccine could prevent trans-
mission of HBV. Eighty percent knew that HBV-infected
individuals might need treatment even if they had no
symptoms. Eighty percent responded that they had re-
ceived some type of HBV education in the past 2 years,
and 95 % percent reported that they received a regular
check-up at least once a year. All respondents stated that
they had received HBV treatment at some point (55.0 %
were on treatment and 45.0 % had taken treatment in
the past). Thirty percent felt that it was necessary to
separate their eating utensils from those of non-infected
family members, and 65.0 % felt that while this was not
necessary, it was advisable.
Discussion
According to study results, HBV knowledge among health
care providers significantly improved after attendance at
an educational seminar. The results also indicate high
levels of HBV knowledge among city residents and chron-
ically infected individuals. However, city residents were
less aware of the availability of treatment for HBV. For all
three groups of study participants, having accurate know-
ledge was not necessarily enough to dispel stigma-related
myths or foster behavior change regarding HBV screening
or treatment. While 85.9 % of city residents correctly
identified HBV transmission routes, more than half still
felt that it was better to keep eating utensils of infected
family members separate. One-quarter of these residents
reported
maintaining
a
distance
from
HBV-infected
individuals for fear of becoming infected themselves.
There were similar results among HBV-infected individ-
uals who responded to the survey: virtually all correctly
identified HBV transmission routes, but 65 % felt that it
was better to not share their eating utensils with family
members. Among providers, another gap between know-
ledge and practice was observed. While providers had
high levels of knowledge regarding HBV transmission and
diagnosis, almost 25 % reported that they only screen
patients if they display symptoms of HBV. There also
appeared to be discordance between providers and resi-
dents regarding testing, as only 35 % of residents
recalled being tested for HBV.
While almost all providers agreed that it was import-
ant for treatment candidates to receive treatment, only
65.5 % of them suggested treatment to their asymptom-
atic treatment candidates. Results from the focus groups
suggest that the high cost of antiviral treatment might
play a role in this. Interestingly, among the 20 HBV-
infected individuals who completed the post-campaign
survey, almost all indicated that they underwent annual
Cohen et al. Hepatology, Medicine and Policy  (2016) 1:4 
Page 6 of 9
 check-ups and had received treatment for their chronic
HBV infection. However, it is not known if the respon-
dents were referring to approved antiviral drug therapies
for chronic HBV infection or to all types of treatment,
including traditional Chinese medicine. The focus groups
indicated that treatment was cost-prohibitive, and it has
been documented that the proportion of HBV-infected in-
dividuals who receive antiviral treatment remains low in
China [19]. More studies are needed in Haimen City to as-
certain the percentage of infected individuals who rou-
tinely
receive
medical
check-ups
as
per
published
guidelines and who receive appropriate antiviral treatment
for their chronic HBV infection.
Additional research would be helpful in identifying
strategies that could be used to enhance future educa-
tional/awareness interventions. Strategies should not
only foster knowledge improvements, but also pro-
mote changes in beliefs and attitudes that can ultim-
ately play a role in stigma reduction and behavior
change. This could help to increase screening for all
residents,
improve
treatment
for
some
treatment
candidates, and reduce discriminatory practices di-
rected at infected individuals. Such strategies could be
based upon behavioral change theories such as the
Heath Belief Model, Health Behavior Framework and
Transtheoretical Stages of Change [20]. These theories
focus on multiple constructs that can be targeted for
change, including knowledge, risk perception, beliefs,
attitudes, and self-efficacy [20]. In doing so, they can
guide
the
development
of
future interventions
to
improve effectiveness in changing HBV-related behav-
iors. Both the Health Belief Model and Transtheoreti-
cal
Stages
of
Change
theories
have
been
used
successfully to improve HBV screening behavior and
similar types of cancer screening behaviors such as
pap tests and colorectal screening [21, 14]. A study
drawing on the constructs of the Health Behavior
Framework looked at awareness of HBV, knowledge
of transmission routes, perceived susceptibility, per-
ceived severity, doctor recommendation, stigma of
HBV
infection,
and
perceived
efficacy
of
testing
among diverse ethnic groups in the United States
(including
Koreans,
Vietnamese,
Hmong,
Chinese,
Cambodians, and Taiwanese). Results indicate that it
could prove to be a valid model for designing inter-
ventions aimed at overcoming challenges to HBV
screening [22].
Stigma and discrimination surrounding hepatitis B in
China and in other parts of the world has been well
documented [23, 24, 11]. A study among Chinese Cana-
dians found that perceptions of HBV-related stigma
were associated with a decreased likelihood of undergo-
ing HBV screening [11]. Strategies to overcome stigma
have
focused
primarily
on
improving
HBV-related
knowledge, but little research has been done to assess
the efficacy of this approach. A recent study conducted
in rural China found that fear of HBV infection rather
than lack of knowledge was what led to HBV-related
stigma and discrimination [14]. Our results add evidence
to the finding that knowledge by itself is not enough to
overcome stigma and discrimination. Even with high
levels of HBV knowledge, large proportions of those sur-
veyed indicated a preference for separating themselves
and/or their eating utensils from infected individuals, for
fear of becoming infected. Studying this phenomenon
further may lead to a better understanding of the path-
way leading to HBV-related stigma and discrimination,
which may in turn inform the design of appropriate
theory-based
interventions
to
reduce
stigma
and
discrimination.
In terms of developing future HBV education and
awareness efforts in China, focus group results across all
groups of study participants suggest that repetitive edu-
cational interventions are advisable and that seminar-
style education sessions should be supplemented with
face-to-face (one-on-one) education by health care pro-
viders and with media-based communication. Addition-
ally, since the costs of screening and treatment were
thought to be prohibitive, future initiatives should
address how these costs can be reduced.
It is necessary for key stakeholders, including health
care providers, infected individuals and city residents,
to have awareness and knowledge of HBV in order to
address chronic HBV infection in China. Educational
campaigns, such as the Gateway to Care, can play an
important role. However, educational/awareness cam-
paigns remain limited in their ability to improve HBV
screening and care without seeing a change in access to
HBV treatment. In China, cost seems to play a prohibi-
tive role in both treatment recommendations by pro-
viders (as seen in this study) and treatment uptake by
patients [19]. Improved access to treatment must be a
necessary component in addressing chronic HBV infec-
tion in China into the future.
This study faced certain limitations. Pre-test data were
not available from all groups, which limits the conclu-
sions that can be drawn regarding the impact of the
Gateway to Care campaign on knowledge change of city
residents and chronically infected individuals. The pre-
and post-intervention questionnaires measuring know-
ledge change among health care providers were not
linked for individual study participants, so a matched
analysis could not be conducted. A matched analysis
might have yielded a better understanding of knowledge
improvement as it relates to provider type or demo-
graphic factors. However, the pre-post analysis con-
firmed that the Gateway to Care campaign significantly
improved HBV-related knowledge among participating

 providers who completed the pre/post surveys. Long-
term follow-up was not completed, so we do not know
if HBV-related knowledge change among providers was
sustainable.
All questionnaires were specifically designed for use in
this study, and while they were piloted tested, no formal
psychometric testing was done to evaluate instrument
validity and reliability (although low percentages of
missing responses may indicate that questions were well
understood by respondents). Additionally, while focus
group participants were randomly selected, they are not
necessarily representative of the greater population in
Haimen City. This could limit the generalizability of
conclusions that could be made from focus group data.
Conclusions
The Gateway to Care education and awareness campaign
was successful in fostering high levels of accurate HBV
knowledge among health care providers in Haimen City,
China. Additionally, city residents and chronically infected
individuals were knowledgeable about HBV transmission,
prevention and symptomology. City residents were less
aware of the availability of treatment for chronic HBV
infection, and results indicate that cost of treatment can
serve as an additional barrier to care. Even with accurate
HBV knowledge, all study groups indicated a preference
for separating infected individuals in certain social situa-
tions. More research is needed to better understand and
address the complexities associated with these stigma-
related beliefs and practices. Future HBV programs in
Haimen City should focus on reducing cost of antiviral
treatment, and should continue to improve awareness and
knowledge, but should also include the use of theoretically
driven behavior change interventions to improve rates of
HBV screening for city residents, as well as to increase the
provision of appropriate care for infected individuals and
treatment for treatment candidates.
