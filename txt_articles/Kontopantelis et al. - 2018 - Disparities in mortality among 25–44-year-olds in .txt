a longitudinal, population-based study

Summary
Background Since the mid-1990s, excess mortality has increased markedly for adults aged 25–44 years in the north 
compared with the south of England. We examined the underlying causes of this excess mortality and the contribution 
of socioeconomic deprivation.
Methods Mortality data from the Office of National Statistics for adults aged 25–44 years were aggregated and 
compared between England’s five most northern versus five most southern government office regions between 
Jan 1, 1981, and Dec 31, 2016. Poisson regression models, adjusted for age and sex, were used to quantify excess 
mortality in the north compared with the south by underlying cause of death (accidents, alcohol related, 
cardiovascular disease and diabetes, drug related, suicide, cancer, and other causes). The role of socioeconomic 
deprivation, as measured by the 2015 Index of Multiple Deprivation, in explaining the excess and regional variability 
was also explored.
Findings A mortality divide between the north and south appeared in the mid-1990s and rapidly expanded thereafter 
for deaths attributed to accidents, alcohol misuse, and drug misuse. In the 2014–16 period, the northern excess was 
incidence rate ratio (IRR) 1·47 (95% CI 1·39–1·54) for cardiovascular reasons, 2·09 (1·94–2·25) for alcohol misuse, 
and 1·60 (1·51–1·70) for drug misuse, across both men and women aged 25–44 years. National mortality rates for 
cardiovascular deaths declined over the study period but a longstanding gap between north and south persisted (from 
33·3 [95% CI 31·8–34·8] in 1981 to 15·0 [14·0–15·9] in 2016 in the north vs from 23·5 [22·3–24·8] to 9·9 [9·2–10·5] 
in the south). Between 2014 and 2016, estimated excess numbers of death in the north versus the south for those aged 
25–44 years were 1881 (95% CI 726–2627) for women and 3530 (2216–4511) for men. Socioeconomic deprivation 
explained up to two-thirds of the excess mortality in the north (IRR for northern effect reduced from 1·15 [95% CI 
1·14–1·15; unadjusted] to 1·05 [1·04–1·05; adjusted for Index of Multiple Deprivation]). By 2016, in addition to the 
persistent north–south gap, mortality rates in London were lower than in all other regions, with IRRs ranging from 
IRR 1·13 (95% CI 1·12–1·15) for the East England to 1·22 (1·20–1·24) for the North East, even after adjusting for 
deprivation.
Interpretation Sharp relative rises in deaths from cardiovascular reasons, alcohol misuse and drug misuse in the 
north compared with the south seem to have created new health divisions between England’s regions. This gap might 
be due to exacerbation of existing social and health inequalities that have been experienced for many years. These 
divisions might suggest increasing psychological distress, despair, and risk taking among young and middle-aged 
adults, particularly outside of London.

Introduction
Historical economic, political, and cultural patterns in 
England have created enduring inequalities in health 
outcomes 
between 
different 
social 
groups 
and 
communities. The most striking of these patterns is 
known as the north–south divide, a persistent disparity 
in wealth and health between the populations living in 
the north and south of the country. Worse health 
outcomes in the north reflect higher mean levels of 
deprivation,1 but deprived neighbourhoods in the north 
also have worse health outcomes than similarly deprived 
neighbourhoods in the south,2 and people with the same 
socio 
economic status tend to have poorer health if they 
live in the north than if they live in the south.3 The 
possible causes of these regional disparities in England 
are complex, and are likely to include environmental, 
occupational, migratory, epigenetic, and lifestyle factors, 
in addition to long-term structural imbalances of 
resources and investment in the south, particularly in 
and around London.4
In England, the north–south divide in health is most 
evident in patterns of mortality. Although national 
mortality has fallen over time in England, and the 
leading causes of death have transitioned from infectious 
diseases and occupational injuries to long-term 
conditions, the risk of premature death (aged <75 years) 
has remained consistently higher in the north than in 
the south.5 Since the 1960s, the proportion of people

dying prematurely has been at least 10% higher in the 
north than the south,6 and the gap has persisted, despite 
high-profile 
inquiries7 
and 
national 
programmes 
intended to address health inequalities.8 Such national 
variability is not uncommon. In the USA, those states 
with the lowest healthy life expectancies are almost 
exclusively concentrated in the south.9 In Spain, 
disability-free life expectancy at birth and at 65 years is 
substantially lower in the south than the north, with the 
difference at least partially attributed to education, 
unemployment, and smoking.10 A north–south mortality 
divide also exists in France, with most départements in 
the south having some of the highest life expectancies 
for both men and women, and those in the north 
consistently having the lowest.11 Italy has one of the 
highest life expectancies in the world, but a more modest 
north–south gap also exists there, with both men and 
women in the north living longer on average than those 
in the south.12
Since the mid-1990s in England, there has been a marked 
trend of increasing excess mortality in the north for those 
aged 25–44 years, which, until recently, was concealed in 
the mortality statistics for the wider English population.5 
This north–south divide first began to emerge in the 
mid-1990s, and the mortality was 40% higher in the north 
than in the south by 2015.5 Deaths in this age group are 
most commonly attributable to cardiovascular disease; 
accidents; and suicide, poisoning, and the sequelae of drug 
and alcohol misuse. However, how much each of these 
factors contributed to the recent rapid rise in mortality in 
young adults living in the north of England compared with 
the south is not known. We identified and explored the 
reasons behind these increases in excess mortality in the 
north, and examined how much of this excess mortality 
could be explained by socioeconomic deprivation.
Methods
Study design and procedures
Information on data sources and methodological and 
population details are provided in the appendix (pp 1–4).13 
Mortality statistics were based on information recorded 
when deaths were certified and registered. Most deaths 
are certified by a medical practitioner, using the Medical 
Certificate of Cause of Death. This certificate is taken to a 
registrar by an informant—usually a near relative of 
the deceased. Deaths should be registered within 5 days 
of the date of death, although there are a number of 
situations when the registration of a death will be 
delayed. In cases of a coroner investigation, the coroner 
sends information to the registrar and this is used to 
register the death. Dates recorded varied across cause of 
death.
Person-level consent and study registration was not 
required because public administrative data were used 
for this population-level study.
Statistical analysis
Deaths and population data were aggregated into the ten 
government office regions, which were then categorised 
as either north (North East, North West, Yorkshire and 
the Humber, East Midlands, and West Midlands) or 
south (East of England, South Central, South West, South 
East, and London).5,6
Cause-specific mortality rates were calculated from 
death registrations with the information used in the 
Office of National Statistics (ONS) mortality statistics 
and came from one of four sources: (1) details supplied 
by the doctor when certifying a death—for example, 
whether the body was seen after death, cause of death, 
when the deceased was last seen alive, and whether a 
post mortem was carried out; (2) details supplied by the 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
In England, profound regional differences exist in standards of 
living, both within and between regions. A stark contrast exists 
between the north and the south of the country, termed the 
north–south divide. Cultural, economic, and social differences 
between the north and the south of England have existed for 
centuries. From 1965 to 2008, the chances of dying early 
(<75 years) were a fifth higher in the north of England than in 
the south, while England’s overall mortality fell by around 50% 
in men and 40% in women. From the mid-1990s, the north of 
England experienced a profound rise in premature mortality in 
adults aged 25–44 years compared with the south. This rise was 
preceded by at least three decades of narrowing inequalities in 
mortality between the regions.
Added value of this study
Excess mortality in the north for ages 25–44 years was primarily 
attributed to alcohol, cardiovascular and drug-related deaths, 
with suicides, cancer and accidents also playing important roles. 
Measured deprivation explained up to two-thirds of excess 
mortality in the north, with the remaining one-third likely 
attributable to unmeasured aspects of deprivation or cultural 
differences.  Most northern regions have higher mortality than 
in most southern regions for young and middle-aged adults, 
but mortality in both north and south are at least 13% higher 
than in London. All of these are findings from this study are 
important to address previously unaswered questions such as 
to what extent are causes of deaths socioeconomically driven 
and is there additional regional variability?
Implications of all the available evidence
Socioeconomic inequalities are at the heart of the north–south 
divide in mortality for people aged 25–44 years. Major 
structural change is needed to counter England’s centralist 
tradition around London, which is driving important public 
health inequalities for people aged 25–44 years, especially men.

informant to the registrar—for example, occupation of 
deceased, sex, usual address, date and place of birth, 
marital status, date of death, place of death; (3) details 
supplied by a coroner to the registrar following 
investigation—for example, cause of death (following 
post mortem), place of accident (following inquest). In 
the case of deaths certified after inquest, the coroner 
supplies the registrar with all the particulars that would 
have been supplied by the informant; and (4) details 
derived from information supplied by one of the above—
for example, age of deceased is derived from date of birth 
and coded cause of death.13 Cause-specific mortality rates 
were also calculated from mid-year population estimates 
and examined by age group (25–29 years, 30–34 years, 
35–39 years, and 40–44 years), sex, and north–south 
dichotomy over time. Categories of death used in this 
study were consistent with those designated by the ONS. 
For each of the groups by cause of death (accidents, 
alcohol related, female breast cancer, other cancers, 
cardiovascular disease and diabetes, drug related, suicide, 
and all other causes), we used a Poisson regression 
model to calculate excess mortality in the north in each 
calendar year, for each sex, adjusted for the age 
distribution of the population in the two respective areas.
The estimated incidence rate ratios (IRRs), which can 
be interpreted as the percentage of population-adjusted 
excess mortality in the north compared with the south, are 
presented in sex-specific contour plots, by sex, to visualise 
changes in excess mortality according to age groups as a 
time-dependent variable. Using the IRR estimates from 
these models and the population structure, we also 
estimated the number of adjusted excess deaths in the 
north by underlying cause (ie, the disease or injury that 
initiated the train of events directly leading to death or 
 
 
 
 
the circumstances of the accident or violence that 
produced the fatal injury) as recorded on the death 
certificate, cross-sectionally for the last 3 years of the study 
period (2014–16) using the following equation:
Where DN is the number of deaths in the north. 
Standardised mortality rates per 100 000 people, by age 
and sex and with the total respective population of the 
study period as the reference (from 1981 or 1993, 
depending on the underlying cause), were calculated for 
each calendar year and by area and plotted over time.
To evaluate the role of deprivation in excess mortality in 
the north, we fitted Poisson regression models, with the 
unit of analysis being a low geography level (lower super 
output area level; approximately 1500 people, appendix 
p 1). Deprivation was measured by the 2015 Index of 
Multiple Deprivation (IMD) with a scale of 0–100, 
transformed to be normally distributed, where a higher 
value means higher deprivation; we report the changed 
association of region when controlling for deprivation.14 
The outcome was all-cause mortality in 2016 and the two 
covariates of interest were area and deprivation; all 
models were adjusted for the age–sex population 
structure. The first model included only area (north vs 
south), a second one included area and overall deprivation, 
and a third included the ten English regions and the 
overall deprivation. A fourth model included area and the 
IMD domains for employment, housing, crime, and 
environment chosen to focus on socioeconomic aspects 
and avoid collinearity; the fifth and final model included 
the ten English regions and these four IMD domains.
To highlight contemporary patterns in numbers of 
deaths, we focused on deaths between 2014 and 2016. 
Additionally, we present time trends for the whole study 
period from 1981 (1993 for drug poisonings) to 2016.

analyses are provided in the appendix.

Results
From Jan 1, 2014, to Dec 31, 2016, 22 530 deaths occurred 
in men and 13 179 in women aged 25–44 years in England. 
The population was larger in the south for all four age 
subgroups, with an annual mean of 4 081 133 women 
and 4 070 223 men aged 25–44 years, compared with 
3 229 532 women and 3 211 064 men in the north. We used 
official ONS data based on extrapolations and over 3 years.
Deaths were substantially higher for men compared 
with women in all four age subgroups: 3 320 versus 1 572 
for the 25–29 years group, 4 370 versus 2 431 for the 
30–34 years group, 5 706 versus 3 466 for the 35–39 years 
group, and 9 134 versus 5 710 for the 40–44 years group 
(figure 1). Accidents (571 [17·2%] of 3320 deaths for the 
25–29 years group, 455 [10·4%] of 4 370 for the 30–34 years 
group, 466 [8·2%] of 5706 for the 35–39 years group, and 
573 [6·3%] of 9134 for the 40–44 years group), suicides 
(850 [25·6%] of 3320, 939 [21·5%] of 4370, 940 [16·5%] of 
5706, and 1254 [13·7%] of 9134, respectively) and drug 
misuse (490 [14·8%] of 3320, 760 [17·4%] of 4370, 
991 [17·4%] of 5706, and 1021 [11·2%] of 9134, respectively) 
were the most common causes of deaths in all age groups 
in men (figure 1). Deaths attributed to cardiovascular 
disease in men increased with age: (318 [9·6%] of 
3320 deaths for the 25–29 years group, 594 [13·6%] of 
4370 for the 30–34 years group, 966 [16·9%] of 5706 for 
the 35–39 years group, and 2137 [23·4%] of 9134 for the 
40–44 years group; figure 1). 
The pattern was similar for women, with a smaller 
contribution from suicides (234 [14·9%] of 1572 deaths 
for the 25–29 years group, 272 [11·2%] of 2431 for the 
30–34 years group, 268 [7·7%] of 3466 for the 35–39 years 
group, and 331 [5·8%] of 5710 for the 40–44 years group) 
and accidents (111 [7·1%] of 1572 deaths for the 
25–29 years group, 132 [5·4%] of 2 431 for the 30–34 years 
group, 116 [3·3%] of 3466 for the 35–39 years group, and 
164 [2·9%] of 5710 for the 40–44 years group). 
Overall in the 2014–16 period, the  northern excess was 
1·47 (95% CI 1·39–1·54) for cardiovascular reasons, 2·09 
(1·94–2·25) for alcohol misuse, and 1·60 (1·51–1·70) for 
drug misuse, across both men and women aged 
25–44 years. The number of people who died between 
Jan 1, 2014, and Dec 31, 2016, was higher in the north 
than the south (18 825 vs 16 884), despite the larger 
population in the south (figure 1). A greater proportion of 
all deaths in people aged 25–44 years were not included 
in one of the seven main groups of interest for women 
compared with men, and consequently were included in 
the other category (4020 [17·8%] men and 2827 [21·5%] 
women). The relative contributions of each group of 
underlying causes are presented in the appendix (p 7).
Changes in excess mortality in the north compared 
with the south from 1981 (1993 for drug-related deaths) to 
2016 are presented in contour plots for each group of 
underlying causes for all ages (appendix pp 10–18). At the 
start of the study period in 1981, all-cause mortality did 
not differ substantially between the north and the south 
in people aged 25–44 years (appendix p 10). In some years 
during the early-to-mid-1990s, there was no difference in 
mortality in men between the north and the south. From 
the mid-1990s, excess mortality in the north increased for 
both sexes, with an IRR of 1·52 (95% CI 1·46–1·58) by the 
end of the study period in 2016 in the 35–39 years group. 
Accidental, alcohol-related, and drug-related deaths were 
associated with the highest excess mortality in the north 
over the whole study period (appendix pp 11, 12, 15), and 
for all causes excess mortality in the north increased over 
time (appendix pp 10–18). Variation between sexes was 
small, although there was higher excess mortality from 
drug misuse for women and higher excess suicide risk 
for men (appendix pp 14, 15). 
Between 2014 and 2016, the number of excess deaths in 
the north compared with the south among women was 
1881 (95% CI 726 to 2627) in total with 153 (–95 to 282) for 
the 25–29 years group, 318 (55 to 478) for the 30–34 years 
group, 650 (377 to 835) for the 35–39 years group, 
and 760 (389 to 1032) for the 40–44 years groups;

for men, the figure was 3530 (2216 to 4511) in total with 
the respective figures of 382 (103 to 572), 615 (315 to 832), 
1031 (711 to 1272), and 1502 (1087 to 1835; figure 2; 
appendix p 8). For women, the major contributing causes, 
excluding other causes, were alcohol related (369 [19·6%] 
of 1881 deaths), drug related (258 [13·7%] of 1881), 
cardiovascular disease (330 [17·5%] of 1881), and all-causes 
cancer (246 [13·1%] of 1881). For men, the patterns were 
similar, but with some key differences. First, suicide was 
also a major contributor for all age groups combined (417 
[11·8%] of 3530 deaths) in men. Second, the contribution 
of cancer was substantially smaller in men than in women 
(178 [5·0%] of 3530 deaths). Third, accidents contributed 
more towards deaths in men (264 [7·5%] of 3530 deaths) 
than women and this underlying cause was the largest 
specific contributor to excess deaths for the 25–29 years 
group (63 [16·5%] of 382 deaths). The proportional 
contribution of each underlying cause is presented in the 
appendix (pp 8, 9, 19). A large proportion of excess deaths 
in the north across all age groups was attributed to causes 
in the other category (526 [28·0%] of 1881 for women and 
752 [21·3%] of 3530 for men). IRRs by age group and 
underlying cause are reported in the appendix (p 9).
Age-standardised mortality rates from 1981 to 2016 
suggested a marked and widening north–south gap 
among both men and women (figure 3). After 2010, 
mortality rates increased nationwide for both sexes, but 
much more sharply in the north than the south, resulting 
in a substantial gap by 2016. Underlying cause-specific 
plots of standardised mortality rates are provided in the 
appendix (pp 20–27); large gaps have emerged since the 
mid-1990s, in alcohol-related (appendix p 21) and drug-
related (appendix p 24) deaths for both sexes. Rates in 
alcohol-related and drug-related deaths have increased 
in the north since the mid-1990s, while remaining 
relatively stable in the south. For accidents, a gap for 
men emerged in the late 1990s as mortality rates declined 
in the south, although rates appear to become similar 
between north and south around 2010 and again in 2015 
(appendix p 20).
National mortality rates for cardiovascular deaths 
declined over the study period but a longstanding gap 
between north and south persisted (from 33·3 [95% CI 
31·8–34·8] in 1981 to 15·0 [14·0–15·9] in 2016 in the 
north vs from 23·5 [–24·8] to 9·9 [9·2–10·5] in the south 
(appendix p 22). Cancer death rates (excluding breast 
cancer) decreased nationwide over time, but the decease 
plateaued from 2005 for women and 2010 for men, with

small levels of northern excess mortality for women 
persisting (appendix p 25). Breast cancer mortality rates 
decreased over time, but plateaued after 2010, with no 
evident mortality excess (appendix p 26). Suicide rates 
have decreased since around 1998 in both sexes, and 
throughout most of the study period there was little 
difference between north and south. A gap in suicides 
emerged for men between 2010 and 2015 as rates climbed 
in the north (appendix p 23). The pattern for other causes 
of death declined over time in the south, for both men 
and women, with the exception of a spike for men in the 
south between 1988 and 1996, but remained largely stable 
in the north. However, increases in northen excess 
deaths in this category emerged around 2000 for men 
and 2005 for women.
Spatial analysis showed clustering of high mortality in 
the post-industrial cities of the north, particularly in the 
North East and North West (figure 4). These standardised 
mortality rates were associated with socioeconomic 
deprivation, which is clustered in urban areas. Additional 
spatial maps, by sex and region, are provided in the 
appendix (pp 28–60).
We used several models to evaluate the role of 
deprivation on excess mortality in the north in 2016. In 
the first model, which did not include deprivation, the 
IRR for the association between area and excess mortality 
in the north was 1·15 (95% CI 1·14–1·15). In the second 
model, which included area and overall deprivation, the 
IRR was 1·07 (95% CI 1·06–1·07). In the third model, in 
which we fitted all ten English regions as categories 
instead of a north–south dichotomy, all regions reported 
higher IRRs compared with London and ranged from 
IRR 1·13 (1·12–1·15) in East England to the North West 
(1·20, 1·19–1·22) and North East (IRR 1·22, 95% CI 
1·20–1·24; figure 5). In the fourth model, which included 
four subdomains of the IMD as covariates rather than 
the overall IMD, the IRR for the association between area 
and mortality was 1·05 (95% CI 1·04–1·05). In the fifth 
model, which included the ten English regions and these 
four IMD domains, we observed a similar regional 
pattern to the third model (figure 5). Pseudo-R² reflected 
about 53% of explained variation for all models.
Discussion
Against a background of longstanding excess mortality in 
the north of England for the whole population, there has 
been a rapid and marked divergence between northern 
and southern mortality for adults aged 25–44 years since 
the mid-1990s. Between 2014 and 2016, this divergence 
resulted in a mean annual excess of deaths in the north of 
627 among women and 1177 among men. The major 
contributors to this disparity were drug misuse, alcohol 
misuse, and cardiovascular disease. Important contri-
butions were also made by suicide among men, especially 
in those aged 30–34 years, and by cancer among women. 
Overall excess mortality in the north was only partially 
explained by deprivation measured at the low geography 
level. Regional analyses showed that much of the north–
south divide is attributable to substantially lower mortality 
in London. Although mortality rates in most northern 
regions were higher than in southern regions, the IRR for 
the region with the lowest rates compared with London 
was 1·13.
The numbers of excess deaths in the north differed 
between men and women aged 25–44 years, with the 
north–south difference being almost double for men 
between 2014 and 2016. This disparity is the result of a 
combination of factors. Primarily, mortality rates for 
men are generally higher; therefore, comparable relative 
differences across sexes would yield higher absolute 
numbers of excess deaths in men in the north. 
Additionally, we observed a greater difference in mortality 
risk in men between the north and the south, compared 
with that in women between these two regions. This sex 
difference in the north–south mortality gap is plausibly

related to greater susceptibility of men to socioeconomic 
pressures.15
The relative contribution of different causes of death 
towards excess mortality in the north has changed 
substantially over time. Cardiovascular deaths have been 
consistently higher in the north, and because cardio-
vascular disease remains a major contributor to total 
deaths, particularly in older men, it explains much of the 
mortality gap between north and south. However, 
cardiovascular disease mortality has decreased by over 
50% over the past four decades, and its contribution to 
regional variations in mortality seems to be weakening.16
Of the broad causes we examined, three—accidents, 
alcohol related, and drug related—showed an increase in 
men in the north from the mid-1990s, coinciding with a 
widening gap compared with the south in all-cause 
mortality. For fatal accidents and drug-related deaths, 
there was further separation from 2010, with mortality 
rates increasing nationwide, but more quickly in the 
north than the south. If these recent patterns are not 
stopped, the national gains made from falling cardio-
vascular deaths will be over-ridden and excess mortality 
in the north could exceed 50%.5
Accidents, alcohol misuse, drug misuse, and suicide 
are all strongly associated with socioeconomic status. For 
example, in international studies, the most deprived men 
are twice as likely to die by suicide as the most affluent 
men, whereas the most deprived women are 1∙5 times as 
likely to die by suicide.17 In England, suicide risk has also 
been associated with unemployment,18 and substantial 
increases in suicide have been observed during periods 
of recession, especially among men.15 However, physical 
health, 
mental 
health, 
and 
deprivation—strong 
independ 
ent risk predictors of suicide19—confound the 
relationship between unemployment and suicide.20 For 
accidents, there is a consistent association between socio-
economic deprivation and trauma incidence, especially 
penetrating serious trauma, and accident and emergency 
attendance.21 For road traffic fatalities, excessive speed, 
intoxication, failure to wear seatbelts, and unlicensed or 
uninsured driving are most prevalent in the most 
deprived areas in England, whereas pedestrian casualties 
are also associated with deprivation.22 Geographical 
analysis of fatal traffic accidents found that nine of the 
ten highest-risk counties are in the north of England, 
with nine of the ten lowest-risk counties in the south.23 In 
particular, there is a north–south divide with the north 
having higher mortality on single carriageways, where 
most road traffic casualties occur, with the exception of 
the South East (highest risk) and the West Midlands 
(lowest risk).24 Northern infra 
structure might be relevant 
in this context, with transport infra 
structure investment 
heavily skewed towards the south, especially London.25 
Work-related fatal accidents are also higher in the north 
of England, mainly owing to variations in regional 
industries and occupations and their associated risks.26 
Fatal domestic accidents, such as fires, are associated 
with risk factors linked to socioeconomic deprivation, 
including smoking and alcohol misuse.27
The role of alcohol is important in this context, 
contributing to a large proportion of accidental injuries 
seen in English hospitals, not only through traffic and 
cycling accidents, but also accidental falls.28 Alcohol use 
also underpins the steep and sustained increase in liver 
cirrhosis deaths in Britain from the 1990s,29 when the 
north–south divide in mortality for those aged 25–44 years 
started to emerge.5 Socioeconomic inequalities, in terms 
of alcohol-related mortality, are greatest among people 
aged 25–44, with five-fold and four-fold relative risks 
in the most deprived areas for men and women, 
respectively.30 Men aged 25–39 years in the unskilled 
manual socioeconomic class are ten to 20 times more 
likely to die from alcohol-related causes, compared with 
those in the professional class,31 with personal income 
being the best predictor of alcohol-related death for 
men.27 Additionally, people living in urban areas 
experience higher alcohol-related mortality compared 
with those living in rural areas, with the association 
being much stronger for men than for women.32
For almost all types of cancer, risk of death is higher and 
death is likely to occur more quickly in more deprived 
areas.33,34 Particularly striking deprivation gradients are 
observed for cancers of the oropharynx and lung, which 
are primarily attributed to smoking.35 Similar disparities 
have been reported for cancer of the cervix, which 
is caused by human papillomavirus, and is largely 
determined by sexual behaviour risk factors, including age 
at first intercourse, number of sexual partners, failure to 
use a condom during intercourse with multiple partners, 
and screening programme non-engagement.36 Alcohol 
misuse also plays a role in cancer mortality, with steep 
socioeconomic gradients for cancer incidence and survival 
 
observed for stomach and liver cancers.37 After alcohol, 
heroin and crack cocaine are the most harmful drugs at 
the population level in England, and deaths from drug 
overdoses are also strongly associated with deprivation,38 
with evidence of strong cohort effects emerging.39
More research is needed to establish what triggered the 
observed divergence in mortality between north and south 
for young and middle-aged adults since the mid-1990s, 
but socioeconomic factors are likely to be central.40 For 
example, in the USA, mortality rates have been rising for 
white non-Hispanics without a college degree and falling 
for those with a degree. Mechanisation, which has affected 
a large number of mid-level jobs in developed countries, 
might be partly to blame for the increased mortality in 
more deprived strata of populations worldwide. Although 
it has also led to an increase in demand for high-skilled 
jobs, there are fewer jobs created than the number of mid-
level jobs lost, and individuals from a deprived background 
are at a dis 
advantage when competing for the high-
skilled jobs.41
However, our findings of a persistent north–south 
divide, even after controlling for area-level deprivation,

suggest there must be additional explanatory factors 
related to geography—for example, net migration (internal 
and external) of healthier individuals to the south of 
England.42 Furthermore, the mortality trends for cardio-
vascular dsease are known to be driven by socioeconomic 
factors, suggesting that divergence between north and 
south is not inevitable. For cardiovascular disease, 
worsening temporal trends in some risk factors 
(eg, physical activity, obesity, and diabetes) have been offset 
by decreases in others (eg, smoking cessation and more 
optimal blood pressure and cholesterol control).43 National 
cardiovascular initiatives have included targeted elements 
resulting in both overall reductions in mortality and some 
reductions in inequalities, particularly in younger age 
groups,44 although the north–south divide in cardiovascular 
mortality remains. For example, the National Service 
Framework 
in 
coronary 
heart 
disease 
promoted 
assessment and treatment of cardiovascular risk in patients 
deemed to be at higher risk, the redesign of heart attack 
centres, and the roll out of primary percutaneous coronary 
interventions, yet the gap remains.45 Similar coordinated 
initiatives, both tackling underlying causes and improving 
health service responses, will be needed to reverse the 
marked recent trends in mortality attributable to accidents, 
alcohol misuse, and drug misuse. 
Our study has some limitations. First, the north–south 
dichotomy as analysed here is one of convenience, 
although it reflects administrative boundaries delineating 
areas of political responsibility, as well as established 
social, economic, and cultural divisions. Second, the 
categorisation of underlying causes of death enabled us to 
attribute most of the deaths to cohesive groups of causes, 
but many were also necessarily placed in the other category. 
Third, a small number of deaths attributed to diabetes, and 
even fewer to obesity, were included in cardiovascular 
deaths. Our aim was to generate an inclusive category, 
since these underlying causes are often linked. Fourth, the 
IMD includes indicators that are closely linked to mortality 
(eg, road traffic accidents), albeit with a time lag in the 2016 
data that we used. Fifth, we assumed a uniform population 
distribution within each age group, which might not be 
the case for London. Sixth, there is a delay in registration 
for one in five premature deaths, and some of our estimates 
may not accurately reflect time of death. Seventh, the role 
of internal and external migration is not taken into account 
and our findings will be at least partially explained by the 
migration of healthy individuals, attracted by better job 
opportunities to the south, especially, London.46 Eighth, 
one could argue that London is unique and an alternative 
north–south comparison should exclude London, to 
quantify the extent to which the north–south differences 
are driven by the population of London. However, we could 
not obtain detailed mortality data at the regional level, only 
aggregated into north and south. This aspect should be 
explored in future work, as well as the role of cohort effects.
In summary, the north–south divide in mortality 
for people aged 25–44 years first emerged during the 
mid-1990s and continued into 2016. This mortality divide 
grew quickly over that period for accidents (in men), 
 
alcohol misuse, and drug misuse, while a longstanding 
gap for cardiovascular deaths remained and a gap for 
suicide in men emerged more recently. The sharp rises 
in mortality for alcohol misuse, and drug misuse are 
concerning. Regional analysis confirms that most of the 
north is faring worse than most of the south, but further 
shows that all regions, north and south, have substantially 
higher mortality rates than London. The reasons for this 
are complex and reach back centuries, with extreme 
concentration of power, wealth, and opportunity in 
London, which without major structural change could 
continue to damage public health.
