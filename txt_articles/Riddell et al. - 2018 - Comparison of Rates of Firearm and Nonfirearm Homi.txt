 Comparison of Rates of Firearm and Nonfirearm Homicide and Suicide
in Black and White Non-Hispanic Men, by U.S. State
Corinne A. Riddell, PhD; Sam Harper, PhD; Magdalena Cerda
´, PhD; and Jay S. Kaufman, PhD
Background: The extent to which differences in homicide and
suicide rates in black versus white men vary by U.S. state is
unknown.
Objective: To compare the rates of firearm and nonfirearm ho-
micide and suicide in black and white non-Hispanic men by U.S.
state and to examine whether these deaths are associated with
state prevalence of gun ownership.
Design: Surveillance study.
Setting: 50 states and the District of Columbia, 2008 to 2016.
Cause-of-death data were abstracted by using the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention'
s WONDER (Wide-ranging On-
line Data for Epidemiologic Research) database.
Participants:
Non-Hispanic black and non-Hispanic white
males, all ages.
Measurements: Absolute rates of and rate differences in fire-
arm and nonfirearm homicide and suicide in black and white
men.
Results: During the 9-year study period, 84 113 homicides and
251 772 suicides occurred. Black–white differences in rates of
firearm homicide and suicide varied widely across states. Rela-
tive to white men, black men had between 9 and 57 additional
firearm homicides per 100 000 per year, with black men in Mis-
souri, Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, and Pennsylvania having more
than 40 additional firearm homicides per 100 000 per year.
White men had between 2 fewer and 16 more firearm suicides
per 100 000 per year, with the largest inequalities observed in
southern and western states and the smallest in the District of
Columbia and densely populated northeastern states.
Limitations: Some homicides and suicides may have been mis-
classified as deaths due to unintentional injury. Survey data on
state household gun ownership were collected in 2004 and may
have shifted during the past decade.
Conclusion: The large state-to-state variation in firearm homi-
cide and suicide rates, as well as the racial inequalities in these
numbers, highlights states where policies may be most benefi-
cial in reducing homicide and suicide deaths and the racial dis-
parities in their rates.

n 2016, non-Hispanic black men were nearly 10.4
times more likely than non-Hispanic white men to die
by homicide in the United States, whereas white men
were 2.5 times more likely than black men to die by
suicide (1). More than 80% of homicides and 60% of
suicides involved firearms. The relative racial inequali-
ties in violent deaths are especially marked for firearm
homicide. Black men are 14 times more likely than
white men to die by firearm homicide (1).
Racial
disparities
in
violent
deaths
are
well-
established in the United States overall, but whether
these inequalities vary by state—and if so, by how
much—is unknown. Large variation in racial disparities
would suggest the presence of explanatory factors that
differ across states. These factors might reflect differ-
ences in race-specific levels of exposure to socioeco-
nomic characteristics, neighborhood residential condi-
tions, medical care, or policy environments that are
known to affect violence (2). Measuring state-to-state
variation in racial disparities in homicide and suicide
rates, which are masked when looking only at the pop-
ulation average, may help identify areas where sub-
populations may have an excess burden of injury and
where efforts might be directed to reduce inequalities.
Across the United States, states with the highest
levels of household gun ownership also have the high-
est rates of firearm suicide and homicide (3). Ecological
studies comparing U.S. states have estimated that gun
ownership rates are positively associated with rates of
firearm homicide and suicide (4–8), and case–control
studies have found positive associations between the
presence of a gun in the home and a person'
s risk for
homicide occurring at home (9), as well as his or her
overall risk for suicide (10). Two components of the
causal pathway to homicide or suicide are motivation
and opportunity (11). Gun availability or ownership in-
creases opportunity, and motivation conceivably might
vary by racial group. For example, participation in ille-
gal activity is linked to increased homicide risk (12),
whereas social support and cultural cohesion are linked
to decreased suicide risk (13). Thus, the relationship
between gun availability and homicide or suicide may
differ according to race. This information is currently
unknown but could inform whether policies aimed at
reducing gun prevalence might have different effects
among blacks versus whites.
In this study, we aimed to compare the rates of
firearm and nonfirearm homicide and suicide among
black and white non-Hispanic men by U.S. state and to

The homicide rate for non-Hispanic white men (open circles) is compared with the rate for non-Hispanic black men (solid circles) for each state. The
area of the circle is proportional to its race-specific population size, as defined in the key. For each state, the difference between rates is shown to
the right of the circles and quantifies the excess number of homicides in black men per 100 000 per year. The average firearm and nonfirearm
homicide rates for the entire United States are shown at the top of each graph, followed by the states organized according to the size of the
black–white difference. States that are missing circles for black or white men had 19 or fewer firearm or nonfirearm homicides within the affected
racial group during the study period, and data were not available for analysis.

 examine the association between state gun ownership
prevalence and firearm homicide and suicide rates.
METHODS
We used the WONDER (Wide-ranging Online Data
for Epidemiologic Research) database of the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention to abstract age-
adjusted rates of homicide and suicide (1). Data were
abstracted for all states and the District of Columbia
between 2008 and 2016 for non-Hispanic white and
black males of any age. Codes from the International
Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, were used to
identify firearm homicides (X93, X94, and X95), nonfire-
arm homicides (X85 to X92, X96 to X99, and Y01 to
Y05), firearm suicides (X72, X73, and X74), and nonfire-
arm suicides (X60 to X71 and X75 to X84). Rates were
suppressed by the data provider for any state that had
fewer than 20 deaths for the race group between 2008
and 2016. Suppressed data were set to missing in our
statistical analysis. These data originated from death
certificates provided by states to the National Vital Sta-
tistics System and overseen by the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention'
s National Center for Health
Statistics. Race and Hispanic ethnicity were recorded by
medical examiners. Throughout this article, we refer to
the study population as men because the vast majority
of deaths occurred after childhood.
We computed the average annual fatality rate ac-
cording to race, intent, and firearm involvement by di-
viding the number of fatalities by the total population
estimate (that is, the sum of population estimates from
2008 to 2016), and we calculated the absolute inequal-
ity (rate difference) in estimates between black and
white men. For homicide, we subtracted the fatality rate
of white men from that of black men. For suicide, these
rates were reversed, such that the estimated rate differ-
ences are mostly positive and interpreted as the num-
ber of additional deaths of black (white) men due to
homicide (suicide) associated with the heightened fa-
tality rate of black (white) men. When either of the race-
specific rates was suppressed, a rate difference was not
calculated for the state. To reflect varying population
sizes among states and by race, we represent the area
of each data marker to be proportional to the race-
specific average annualized population size.
To examine the relationships among household
gun ownership, firearm homicide, and firearm suicide
by race and state, we used the last available state-level
estimates of household firearm ownership from the
National Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System
(BRFSS) from 2004. The BRFSS is an annual telephone
survey of the noninstitutionalized adult population that
asks respondents about their health-related risk behav-
iors, chronic health conditions, and use of preventive
services. In 2001, 2002, and 2004, the BRFSS asked,
“Are any firearms kept in or around your home?” More
than 293 000 people responded to this question; esti-
mates of household gun ownership prevalence (per-
centage) by state were computed previously and
ranged from 10.2% in Hawaii to 65.5% in Wyoming
(14). Given that respondents may have underreported
gun ownership and that state gun prevalence may have
shifted since 2004, we grouped states into 4 broad cat-
egories of gun prevalence—10.2% to 19.9%, 20.0% to
34.9%, 35.0% to 44.9%, and 45.0% to 65.5%—to pro-
vide a reasonable approximation of current levels of
ownership.
We then visually assessed the relationships among
state gun prevalence, firearm homicide, and firearm
suicide by plotting the rate of firearm homicide as a
function of firearm suicide. We color-coded the points
by category of gun prevalence, separately for black and
white men. This descriptive exercise illustrates whether
states with relatively high rates of firearm homicide also
have relatively high rates of firearm suicide, and whether
this pattern exists for both black and white men and is
associated with state gun ownership. A strong association
would suggest that firearm homicide and suicide share
risk factors and may be amenable to similar prevention
strategies. A weak association would indicate less overlap
in risk factors and therefore a need for distinct preventive
approaches.
Data management and visualization were performed
in R, version 3.3.2 (The R Foundation) (15). Because this
study used publicly accessible data, an institutional ethical
review was not required (16). A replication data set includ-
ing the raw data and statistical code to reproduce this
work is publicly available on GitHub (https://github.com

Role of the Funding Source
This research was not formally supported by a re-
search grant, although one of the authors (M.C.) was
supported by the National Institutes of Health (grant

RESULTS
Our
analysis
included
84 113
homicides
and
251 772 suicides from 2008 to 2016. Homicide deaths
were suppressed by the National Center for Health Sta-
tistics for black men in 16 states and for white men in 8
states. Suicide deaths were suppressed in 14 states for
black men; no suicides were suppressed for white men.
Comparison of Firearm Homicide Rates
Figure 1 displays the homicide rates among black
versus white men, according to state and firearm use.
The Supplement (available at Annals.org) contains ta-
bles providing the exact estimates of the rates shown in
the figures. Across the entire United States, black men
had 27 more homicides per 100 000 per year than
white men. The black–white difference in firearm homi-
cide rates varied strikingly by state, from 9 to 57 per
100 000 per year, and was driven by marked variation
in firearm homicides of black men across states. States
with the smallest firearm homicide rates among blacks
had fewer than 15 deaths per 100 000 per year during
the study period, compared with more than 40 deaths
per 100 000 per year in states with the highest rates.
Firearm homicide rates for white men showed relatively
little variation across states: between 1 and 5 deaths

The suicide rate for non-Hispanic white men (open circles) is compared with the rate for non-Hispanic black men (solid circles) for each state. The
area of the circle is proportional to its race-specific population size, as defined in the key. For each state, the difference between rates is listed to
the right of the circles and quantifies the excess number of suicides in white men per 100 000 per year. The average firearm and nonfirearm suicide
rates for the entire United States are shown at the top of each graph, followed by the states organized according to the size of the white–black

 per 100 000 per year. The states with the highest rates
of firearm homicide for black men (namely Missouri,
Michigan, Illinois, and Indiana) also had the largest dif-
ferences in rates between blacks and whites, signaling
states that had the highest risk for blacks but a relatively
low risk for whites. The District of Columbia also had a
relatively high risk for black but not white men.
Comparison of Firearm Homicide Rates in Black
Men Among States With the Largest Black
Populations
Another way to make comparisons is to consider
the states that are home to the most black residents to
determine whether these states also varied in their
rates of firearm homicide compared with spatially con-
tiguous states. Nearly 40% of the U.S. black population
lives in Georgia, New York, Florida, Texas, and Califor-
nia, and make up between 6% and 30% of each state'
s
population. Among these states, Texas exhibited the
smallest black–white difference in firearm homicide (15
additional deaths in black men per 100 000 per year),
which also was substantially lower than the differences
estimated for neighboring states, including Louisiana
(+39), Oklahoma (+30), and Arkansas (+29). Georgia
(+18) and Florida (+23) had differences similar to those
of nearby South Carolina (+21) and North Carolina
(+18) and had lower rates than Alabama (+29) and Ten-
nessee (+30). New York'
s difference (+18) was similar
to that of Massachusetts (+16) and Connecticut (+21)
but substantially lower than the rates of neighboring
New Jersey (+31) and Pennsylvania (+42). California ex-
hibited the largest black–white difference (+30) in fire-
arm homicide among the 5 states with the largest black
populations. California'
s black–white difference was
larger than that estimated for contiguous states, includ-
ing Nevada (+20) and Oregon (+12), although these
states had relatively small black populations.
Comparison of Nonfirearm Homicide Rates
Nonfirearm homicides occur much less frequently
among both black and white men. On average, 3 more
nonfirearm homicides per 100 000 per year occurred
among black than white men. Black men had rates that
varied between 2 and 8 per 100 000 per year by state,
whereas rates in white men were less than 1 per
100 000 per year. On average, firearm homicide rates
were 9-fold higher than nonfirearm rates among black
men. The states with the largest differences between
firearm and nonfirearm homicide rates were Missouri,
Indiana, Illinois, and Louisiana, each of which had fire-
arm homicide rates more than 12 times higher than
their nonfirearm homicide rates.
Comparison of Firearm Suicide Rates
In contrast to homicide, suicide rates were higher
among white than black men, independent of firearms
involvement, with the exception of firearm suicide in
the District of Columbia (Figure 2). Across the United

 States, white men had 9 more firearm suicides per
100 000 per year than black men. The white–black dif-
ference in firearm suicides varied from �2 per 100 000
per year in the District of Columbia to 16 per 100 000
per year in Missouri, although differences could not be
estimated for 12 states with fewer than 20 firearm sui-
cides among blacks. The annual rate of firearm suicide
varied more markedly for white than black men: from 2
per 100 000 per year in the District of Columbia to 29
per 100 000 per year in Wyoming for white men, com-
pared with a range of 2 per 100 000 per year in Massa-
chusetts to 13 per 100 000 per year in Alaska among
black men.
Six of the 10 states with the largest white–black differ-
ences in firearm suicide—Mississippi, Arkansas, Alabama,
Texas, South Carolina, and Louisiana—are located in the
South, whereas the other 4—Nevada, Arizona, New Mex-
ico, and Colorado—are in the West (range, 12.9 to 15.7
per 100 000 per year). Along with the District of Colum-
bia, the northeastern states of Massachusetts, New Jersey,
Connecticut, and New York had the smallest white–black
differences (≤4 per 100 000 per year) in firearm suicide
rates.
Comparison of Nonfirearm Suicide Rates
The rates of nonfirearm suicides among whites and
blacks, as well as the difference between rates, varied
substantially less than the rates of suicides involving
firearms. In the United States overall, the nonfirearm
suicide mortality rate was 10.6 per 100 000 per year in
white men compared with 4.4 per 100 000 per year
among black men. Of all the states, Hawaii had the
highest rate of nonfirearm suicides for white men—19
per 100 000 per year—whereas Nebraska had the low-
est rate—8 per 100 000 per year. For black men, the
highest estimated rate was 8 per 100 000 per year in
Colorado; the lowest was 3 per 100 000 per year in
Mississippi.
Relationship of Firearm Homicide and Suicide to
State Household Gun Ownership Among White
Men
Firearm homicide and suicide were strongly asso-
ciated for white men (Figure 3). In terms of the relation-
ship among firearm homicide, suicide, and state gun
prevalence, the 5 states with lower rates of both firearm
homicide and suicide in white men (namely Massachu-
setts, New Jersey, Rhode Island, New York, and Con-
necticut) also were in the lowest category of reported
state gun prevalence. Furthermore, many states with
the highest firearm homicide and suicide rates be-
longed to the highest category of gun prevalence,
whereas most states located in the middle of the graph
were in the middle categories of gun prevalence. Of
note, several states in the highest gun prevalence cat-

 egory had relatively low rates of firearm homicide, in-
cluding Iowa, Nebraska, the Dakotas, Idaho, Montana,
and Wyoming.
Relationship of Firearm Homicide and Suicide to
State Household Gun Ownership Among Black
Men
Among black men, firearm homicide and suicide
were modestly associated (Figure 4). States with the
lowest reported prevalence of guns had the lowest
rates of firearm suicide and below-average rates of fire-
arm homicide. Missouri and several rust belt states (Illi-
nois, Indiana, Michigan, and Pennsylvania) reported the
most firearm homicides among black men but medium
levels of gun ownership. Among the southern states,
those with high levels of gun ownership, such as Loui-
siana, reported higher homicide rates among black
men than states with medium levels, such as Texas.
DISCUSSION
Firearm homicide rates among black men varied
substantially across states. For white men, rates were
consistently lower and less variable, leading to large
racial inequalities in firearm homicide, especially in
Missouri, Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, and Pennsylvania.
Nonfirearm homicides occurred much less frequently
than firearm homicides and exhibited little variation
across states. However, these homicides still occurred
more frequently among black than white men. White
men were at higher risk than black men for firearm sui-
cide, most notably in Mississippi, Nevada, Arkansas,
New Mexico, and Alabama. Northeastern states with re-
liable data (New York, Connecticut, New Jersey, and
Massachusetts) and the District of Columbia showed
the smallest differences in firearm suicide rates. These
states also had the lowest suicide risk for both black
and white men, implying that they offer the lowest race-
specific risks and are the closest to achieving racial
equality in firearm suicide. In terms of nonfirearm sui-
cide, white men had higher rates than black men, al-
though these rates varied less than those of firearm
suicide.
For white men, firearm homicide and suicide
shared a strong positive association. This suggests that
the characteristics that generate variation across states
in firearm homicide and suicide are similar for white
men. States with the lowest gun ownership rates had
the lowest rates of firearm homicide and suicide among
white men, and several states with the highest gun
ownership rates had the highest rates of firearm homi-
cide and relatively high rates of firearm suicide.
The relationship between firearm homicide and
suicide was modest for black men. In contrast to white
men, this moderate relationship suggests that the risk
factors for firearm homicide and suicide for black men
are more dissimilar, and the substantial variation in fire-
arm homicide among black men suggests the presence
of additional explanatory factors for firearm homicide
compared with firearm suicide. Although state gun
ownership was positively associated with both out-
comes for white men, some states with medium levels
of gun ownership had the highest homicide rates
among black men, whereas others had relatively low
rates, implying the presence of important unexamined
factors in determining homicide risk for black men.
The spatial distribution of homicides is known to
vary, with suicides occurring at the highest rates in the
most rural settings and homicides occurring at the
highest rates in the most urban settings (17). Particu-
larly with respect to homicide, this urban–rural divide
probably reflects predictors present in metropolitan
environments, such as higher levels of income inequal-
ity, female-headed households, and crowding (18).
Higher suicide rates in rural areas have been attributed
to social and geographic isolation, access to lethal
mechanisms, and stresses associated with agricultural
work (19).
Although ample research has been done on homi-
cide and suicide risk factors, the mechanisms that have
led to varying racial inequalities across states are less
clear. Structural disadvantage (namely concentrated
poverty, joblessness, and family disruption) (20), racial
residential segregation (21–24), and participation in
drug markets (25, 26) have all been implicated in the
higher risk for homicide among black men relative to
white men. Thus, these risk factors may occur more fre-
quently among black men residing in states with the
largest disparities in firearm homicide.
Firearm policy also has been implicated in differ-
ences in the overall rates of homicide and suicide
across the United States. A cross-sectional ecological
study found that states with more restrictive firearm
laws had 6.6 fewer firearm deaths per 100 000 per year
than states with the least restrictive environments (27).
Analyses comparing states that revised their firearm
policies with a synthetic control estimated that changes
to permit-to-purchase laws are linked to decreases in
firearm (but not nonfirearm) homicide and suicide rates
(28, 29). Thus, differences in state policy environments
probably have contributed to the levels of homicide
and suicide estimated in this study, although whether
policies are linked to racial inequalities is less clear.
State gun prevalence was strongly tied to firearm
suicide for both black and white men, and firearms are
the most lethal means of attempted suicide (30, 31). In
addition, states with the lowest risk for firearm suicide
also had the most restrictive gun laws (32).
Alcohol is another important risk factor for suicide,
in terms of both history of alcoholism and overuse at
the time of suicide (33, 34). Alcohol was found in the
system of 25% of white and 15% of black men who died
by suicide in 2005 to 2006, with 16% of the white men
being described as alcohol dependent at the time of
suicide, compared with 7% of the black men (35). Given
that white men have higher rates of alcohol abuse than
black men (35), alcohol use might be implicated in both
the direction of the white–black inequality and its vari-
ation across states.
Although we could not estimate state-level dispar-
ities in age-specific mortality rates, national figures in-
dicate very different trends for black and white men

 (36). Suicidal risk increases for white men as they age
and exceeds 30 firearm suicides per 100 000 per year
for men aged 75 years or older. For black men, the
peak rate of 10 firearm suicides per 100 000 per year
occurs at ages 25 to 29 years (36). The estimated white–
black differences in suicide mortality and their variation
by state therefore may reflect differences across states
in the risks for younger black and older white men to
commit suicide by firearm.
We searched MEDLINE for literature on racial dis-
parities in homicide or suicide using the search strategy
“Homicide”[MeSH] OR “Suicide”[MeSH]) AND
(health disparit [Text Word] OR health inequal
[Text Word] OR health inequit [Text Word] OR
social disparit [Text Word] OR social inequit
[Text Word] OR social inequal [Text Word])
from database conception to 19 January 2018 with no
language restriction. We identified 102 articles, none of
which estimated inequalities in homicide or suicide
mortality by U.S. state. One report did classify states
according to their rates of overall homicide mortality
(37). This report estimated that overall rates of homi-
cide mortality ranged from 1.1 to 12.8 deaths per
100 000 in 2009, with southern states generally having
the highest rates (37). Given the large differences in
homicide mortality by race, our analysis adds to these
findings by emphasizing racial disparities and demon-
strating their considerable variation across states.
This study was subject to several limitations. Some
homicide and suicide deaths are difficult to classify. Ho-
micides may be classified as suicides, or vice versa, and
either may be misclassified as an unintentional injury.
Misclassification of drug poisoning deaths is particu-
larly important during the current opioid epidemic,
which has led to a sharp increase in fatal overdoses
(38). The most recent data on state gun ownership was
collected in 2004, 4 to 12 years before the mortality
data used in this study. Given that more than 80% of
firearm suicide attempts are fatal (30, 31) and approxi-
mately 20% of firearm homicide attempts result in
death (39), studying only fatal outcomes misses the
morbidity of nonfatal assaults and suicide attempts. We
were limited to contrasting age-standardized mortality
rates but would rather have contrasted age-specific
rates, had there been more deaths. We did not exam-
ine homicide or suicide in women, because their risks
are much lower than men'
s, and data for black women
were suppressed for more than half the states. We did
not examine homicide or suicide in Hispanic persons,
because they are subject to higher rates of misclassifi-
cation on death certificates than blacks and whites (40),
and extracting Hispanic persons from the black–white
grouping would have cut the data too sparsely. Finally,
these results are purely descriptive and make no claims
regarding causal mechanisms.
This work elicits questions for future investigation.
In particular, we would like to better understand the
wide variation in black homicide rates, especially across
southern and rust belt states with similar levels of gun
ownership. Multilevel models that account for state-,
county-, and individual-level characteristics also might
shed light on the reasons for the variation in homicide
and suicide rates across states.
Firearms feature differently in the deaths of black
and white men in the United States. The large variation
in homicide and suicide rates and their racial differ-
ences across states highlight areas where policies may
help reduce the rates of homicide and suicide, as well
as their racial disparities.
