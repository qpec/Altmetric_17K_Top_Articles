ABSTRACT
Deciding when to return to sport after injury is complex
and multifactorial—an exercise in risk management.
Return to sport decisions are made every day by
clinicians, athletes and coaches, ideally in a collaborative
way. The purpose of this consensus statement was to
present and synthesise current evidence to make
recommendations for return to sport decision-making,
clinical practice and future research directions related to
returning athletes to sport. A half day meeting was held
in Bern, Switzerland, after the First World Congress in
Sports Physical Therapy. 17 expert clinicians participated.
4 main sections were initially agreed upon, then
participants elected to join 1 of the 4 groups—each
group focused on 1 section of the consensus statement.
Participants in each group discussed and summarised the
key issues for their section before the 17-member group
met again for discussion to reach consensus on the
content of the 4 sections. Return to sport is not a
decision taken in isolation at the end of the recovery and
rehabilitation process. Instead, return to sport should be
viewed as a continuum, paralleled with recovery and
rehabilitation. Biopsychosocial models may help the
clinician make sense of individual factors that may
influence the athlete’s return to sport, and the Strategic
Assessment of Risk and Risk Tolerance framework may
help decision-makers synthesise information to make an
optimal return to sport decision. Research evidence to
support return to sport decisions in clinical practice is
scarce. Future research should focus on a standardised
approach to defining, measuring and reporting return to
sport outcomes, and identifying valuable prognostic
factors for returning to sport.
BACKGROUND
After a sports injury, the first question asked by
most athletes (and coaches) is: ‘When will I (the
athlete) be able to compete again?’ The answer to
this question is rarely straightforward and is influ-
enced by many factors. However, in most cases the
goals of the injured athlete and the treating clin-
ician (plus other stakeholders in the decision-
making team, such as coaches, parents and man-
agers) are the same—to facilitate a timely and safe
return to sport (RTS).
The Swiss Sport Physiotherapy Association along
with the International Federation of Sports Physical
Therapy and the BJSM hosted the first international
RTS
congress
in
Bern,
Switzerland
(20–21
November 2015). The aim of the congress was to
present current evidence and guidelines in areas
where sports medicine clinicians (particularly phy-
siotherapists and physicians) play a major role in
helping athletes to RTS after injury or surgery. The
congress also acknowledged the important role of
practitioners including orthopaedic surgeons, phy-
siologists, coaches, and strength and conditioning
professionals in helping athletes RTS.
Consensus process
A half day consensus meeting was held following
the congress (22 November), and 17 members of
the consensus group participated. Prior to the con-
gress,
members
of
the
consensus
group
were
invited to write a narrative review on their topic
area. Authors were asked to focus on summarising
what is currently known and what are the future
advances needed to advance knowledge in RTS.
This information was disseminated to the group
and used as a basis for the first round-table discus-
sion, facilitated by two researchers (CLA and
KMK), where the four sections of this statement
were initially agreed on. Participants then elected to
join one of the four groups, and each group
focused on a different section of the statement.
A section leader was nominated by the members of
each group, and participants in each group dis-
cussed and summarised the key issues for their
section. Each of the groups then presented their
summary, and the 17-member group discussed the
key issues to refine each section.
Objective
This consensus builds on important formative work
published over a decade ago, regarding the team
physician’s role in the athlete’s RTS. In 2002, an
expert panel
representing the most prominent
American orthopaedic, sports and family medicine
member societies placed the team physician prom-
inently as the gatekeeper of the RTS decision.1 The
field of sport and exercise medicine has progressed
considerably since then.2 Now, more than ever,
decision-making models and ways of practising that
are
athlete-centred
are
advocated,
placing
the
athlete in the position of an active decision-maker

Our
consensus
reflects this athlete-centred approach.
Terminology and structure
In recent years, the issues relating to the resumption of sports
participation following injury have often been discussed using
the term ‘return to play’ (RTP). Although RTP is common in
sports medicine vernacular, the word ‘play’ is most applicable to
the team sport athlete. This consensus statement is intended to
be relevant to, and inclusive of, all sports and all athletes.
Therefore, we use the term ‘return to sport’.
This consensus statement is divided into four main sections:
1. Definitions related to RTS and the sports participation
context
2. Models to help understand and guide the RTS process
3. Evidence to inform RTS decision-making
4. Priorities for future research
SECTION 1: DEFINING RTS
To make an informed RTS decision, the definition of each RTS
process should, at a minimum, be according to the sport (eg, ice
hockey, squash, 100 m sprint) and the level of participation (eg,
NCAA Division I, English Premier League, local recreational
football league) that the athlete aims to return to.
RTS success
Success means different things to different people and is
context-dependent and outcome-dependent. To the athlete,
success might be defined by return to sustained participation in
sport in the shortest possible time (goal focus). To the coach
(and many athletes), success might be defined relative to the ath-
lete’s performance on RTS (performance focus). To the clin-
ician, success might be defined by the prevention of new (or
recurring) associated injuries (outcome focus). The decision-
making team must collaboratively decide on how success will be
defined, as soon as possible after the injury.
Contextual considerations
Contextual factors influence the expectations and risk tolerance
for RTS. These include the type of injury or illness (eg, acute vs
chronic), the athlete’s age (or stage of career), type of sport
played (eg, individual or team, contact or non-contact), physical
demands of the sport (eg, cutting, pivoting, landing), level of
participation (eg, amateur professional), significance of upcom-
ing
participation
opportunities
(eg,
championship
match,
Olympic final, preseason practice) and social and financial costs.
Progression and documentation
RTS can be viewed as a continuum paralleled with recovery and
rehabilitation—not simply a decision taken in isolation at the
end of the recovery and rehabilitation process. As injury is an
inevitable part of sports participation, optimal contingency plan-
ning for RTS might even happen before an injury occurs (or at
least as soon as the injury occurs).
Documentation should incorporate (but not be limited to):
definition of sport, relevant contextual factors, RTS goals and
performance on relevant clinical and functional tests to give evi-
dence that could be used to guide RTS decision-making. It will
also often be helpful to define and document the roles, responsi-
bilities and actions of each member of the RTS decision-making
team.
In a RTS continuum we define three elements (figure 1),
emphasising a graded, criterion-based progression, that is applic-
able for any sport and aligned with RTS goals.
1. Return to participation. The athlete may be participating in
rehabilitation, training (modified or unrestricted), or in
sport, but at a level lower than his or her RTS goal. The
athlete is physically active, but not yet ‘ready’ (medically,
physically and/or psychologically) to RTS. It is possible to
train to perform, but this does not automatically mean RTS.
2. Return to sport (RTS). The athlete has returned to his or
her defined sport, but is not performing at his or her desired
performance level. Some athletes may be satisfied with
reaching this stage, and this can represent successful RTS for
that individual.
3. Return to performance. This extends the RTS element. The
athlete has gradually returned to his or her defined sport
and is performing at or above his or her preinjury level. For
some athletes this stage may be characterised by personal
best performance or expected personal growth as it relates
to performance.
RTS versus removal from sport: introducing a new way of
thinking about RTS
In certain situations, the RTS decision may be reversed to a
removal from sport decision. In injuries where symptoms grad-
ually increase over time, the shared decision-making process
may relate to reducing loading (ie, modifying training or compe-
tition),
or
when
the
athlete
should
cease
participation
altogether. In some acute injuries, the clinician must also recog-
nise when immediate removal from sport is necessary to protect
the health of the athlete (eg, removal from sport is vital to
protect the health of the concussed athlete).6
Removal from sport does not necessarily mean that the
athlete ceases all participation. Rather, the shared decision may
be to modify the training and/or match load. For example, the
athlete may not complete every training session, or the athlete’s
court time might be reduced and partly substituted with
rehabilitation focused training. Decisions about reducing load,
removal from sport and the subsequent RTS require the athlete,
coach(es) and clinician(s) to work closely together. However, in
some jurisdictions, clinicians are legally required to act on their
own initiative if it is necessary to protect the health of the
athlete.
RTS: whose decision is it anyway?
In contemporary clinical practice, the RTS decision should be a
decision shared4 between all stakeholders. This requires well-
defined roles,7 and a dispute resolution system to protect the
athlete from coercion when there are competing risk tolerances
across stakeholders.5
Summary
The key points regarding definitions of RTS and the RTS con-
tinuum are presented in box 1.
SECTION 2: MODELS TO HELP UNDERSTAND AND GUIDE
THE RTS PROCESS
Theoretical models can help clinicians make sense of the myriad
factors that influence RTS outcomes, as well as encourage con-
sistency and transparency in RTS decision-making. In this

 section, we describe the three models that may help the athlete
and
clinician
with
RTS
planning,
decision-making
and
transition.
The Strategic Assessment of Risk and Risk Tolerance
(StARRT) framework—guiding the RTS decision
The Strategic Assessment of Risk and Risk Tolerance (StARRT)
model8 is a three-step model that helps estimate the risks of dif-
ferent short-term and long-term outcomes associated with RTS,
and factors that may affect what should be considered an accept-
able risk within a particular context (figure 2).
Step 1 (tissue health) of the StARRT framework synthesises
information relevant to the load (stress) the tissue can absorb
before injury. Step 2 (tissue stresses) synthesises information
relevant to the expected cumulative load (stress) on the tissue.
Step 3 (risk tolerance modifiers) synthesises information relevant
to the contextual factors that influence the RTS decision-
maker’s tolerance for risk.
Biopsychosocial model—addressing the best interests
of the athlete
Biopsychosocial approaches are common in health settings.9–12
In the athletic injury context, they provide all RTS stakeholders
with a framework for considering the biological, psychological
and social factors that might influence treatment and outcome
after athletic injury, and might be important to consider for RTS
(figure 3).
Optimal loading—‘the Goldilocks approach’
Load progression is a key part of rehabilitation and RTS
decision-making. Achieving and maintaining optimal loading13
are important clinical considerations. Monitoring the training
load during the current training week (acute) against the
average of preceding four training weeks (chronic) provides an
acute:chronic workload ratio.14 This ratio might also be a
useful tool in planning load progressions in RTS,14 especially
when the athlete is transitioning from return to participation
to RTS, and from RTS to return to performance in the RTS
continuum. Still further research is needed to evaluate whether
Box 1
Key take home messages regarding definitions
for return to sport (RTS)
▸ The minimum information required to define RTS is: the
sport and the level of participation the athlete aims to return
to.
▸ RTS is a continuum comprising three elements: return to
participation, return to sport and return to performance.
▸ In certain situations the RTS decision may be reversed to a
removal from sport decision.
▸ The RTS decision should be shared among all stakeholders
(except in the case of health risk to the athlete).

Summary
The key points regarding how RTS models can help guide the
RTS decision and transition are presented in box 2.
SECTION 3: WHAT EVIDENCE DO WE HAVE TO INFORM
THE CLINICIAN’S CONTRIBUTION TO THE SHARED RTS
DECISION?
In this section, we summarise the evidence regarding RTS in
commonly injured body regions. Using an appropriate combin-
ation of research evidence, athlete preference and clinical
expertise,3 high-quality, intensive rehabilitation15 and a highly
motivated athlete16 are important for optimal RTS. Functional
and sport-specific conditioning tests play an important role in
RTS decision-making,17
18 and many of the factors deemed
important in RTS decision-making are based on prospective
studies defining the risk factors for injury.
Assessing readiness to RTS
Most functional test procedures are based on closed skill tasks
(eg, single or triple hop, T drill, figure 8 runs), but sport requires
open skills in addition to closed skills. Open skills have a reactive
element to execute the motor task, usually in addition to
decision-making, often in a fatigued state. Therefore, relying on
closed skill tasks alone in determining readiness to RTS is not
optimal. Gradual and sequential introduction of sport-specific
training can be used as functional tests that include an element
of protected reactive decision-making (ideally context spe-
cific).19–21 Any battery of tests assessing the athlete’s readiness to
RTS should consider both open and closed skills, although in
some clinical contexts this may be difficult because of factors
including time, space and resources. If this is the case, assessment
of closed skills in conjunction with other impairment-based and
functional parameters gives the clinician and the athlete a
minimum level of information for RTS decision-making.
Physical testing has historically received most attention in RTS
decisions, but psychological readiness is also an important
element for optimal RTS. Emotions including fear of reinjury
and cognitive factors including self-efficacy and motivation influ-
ence RTS.22–25 The ACL-Return to Sport after Injury scale26 and
the Injury Psychological Readiness to Return to Sport scale27 are
evidence-based scales that may assist the clinician assess the ath-
lete’s psychological readiness to RTS after injury.
Specific sports injuries and RTS considerations
Acute knee injuries
Prevalence
ACL injuries are reported to occur with an annual incidence of
85/100 000 people.28 The majority occur as non-contact injur-
ies,29 and adolescent girls are at the highest risk.30 Medial

Box 2
Key take home messages regarding models that
can guide return to sport (RTS)
▸ Considering the biological, psychological and social factors
influencing the RTS decision and transition can assist the
clinician to optimally contribute to the shared RTS decision
(figure 4).
▸ The composition of, and roles within the decision-making
team should be determined as early as possible.
▸ Members of the RTS decision-making team should be
prepared to regularly share information among all relevant
stakeholders.
▸ Regular assessments and review of goals should be
scheduled.

 collateral ligament (MCL) injuries are the second most common
serious injury in football (behind the ACL), with 70% occurring
as a result of contact.31 Medial and lateral meniscus injuries and
articular cartilage injuries frequently occur in combination with
knee ligament injuries.32
RTS rate and time to RTS
About half of athletes return to competitive sport after primary
ACL reconstruction, while 65% return to their preinjury
sport.33 Around 60% of non-professional athletes RTS after
non-operative treatment,34 although this has not been exten-
sively
investigated
and
the
available
studies
are
variable.
Regardless of treatment, the RTS rate is affected by factors
including specific sport demands and regional differences.15 35
RTS rates are lower after revision ACL reconstruction than after
primary surgery.36 37 The length of time taken to RTS after
ACL injury is variable, although only a minority of athletes have
returned to their preinjury level 1 year after surgical reconstruc-
tion.38 In men’s professional football, almost all players RTS
after ACL reconstruction.39
The mean lay-off time in professional football for all MCL
injuries is 23±23 days.40 Most MCL injuries can be managed
conservatively, although grade III MCL injuries, or involvement
of the deep MCL and/or the posterior oblique ligament are
associated with longer recovery time.41 42
Athletes who require lateral meniscus treatment have longer
recovery times and lower RTS rates than athletes who require
medial meniscus treatment.43 44
Factors associated with returning or not returning to sport
Younger age, absence of concomitant full thickness cartilage
injury, being a professional athlete, psychological readiness and
symmetrical knee function are important for RTS.15 33 45–47
Additionally, close follow-up and high-quality sports physiother-
apy interventions increase the likelihood of RTS.16
Factors associated with increased risk of ACL graft rupture
are young age (<20 years), continued participation in pivoting
sports and the use of allografts.15 32 48–50 Athletes who have
had an ACL injury retire at a younger age than athletes without
previous ACL injury,51 although the reasons for this are yet to
be fully elucidated.
RTS criteria (based on published literature)
Supporting optimal physical and psychological function with
respect to RTS is an important clinical consideration to promote
sustained sports participation. Therefore, we recommend the
incorporation of assessments of direction changes and reactive
agility tests into standard RTS criteria, and the assessment of
psychological readiness to RTS using an instrument such as the
ACL-Return to Sport after Injury scale.26
Acute hamstring injuries
Prevalence
Acute hamstring injury is the most frequent non-contact muscle
injury in sports involving high-speed running;31 52–54 with a
consistently high incidence,31 55 and high reinjury risk.55–58
RTS rate and time to RTS
Time to RTS after acute hamstring injuries varies substantially
between studies, from an average of 11.3 days59 to 50 weeks.60
Among professional football players, the mean lay-off time was
18±1961 and 19±1762 days. Following surgical repair after
total proximal hamstring ruptures, RTP is generally allowed
after 6–9 months.63 64
Figure 4
Integrating RTS information to make an optimal decision. The top part (1) describes the management aspects that need to be addressed
to lead the rehabilitation project. The bottom part (2) shows the progression of rehabilitation on a timeline, where load is progressively increased to
promote tissue healing, but can be excessive and require adaptation to avoid damage. These adaptations go thorough iterations where the StARRT
model is applied at different time points until eventual full RTS. Final decisions are reached by applying a shared decision-making process.

 Factors associated with returning to sport or not returning to sport
Although multiple studies have assessed the possible predictors
for time to RTS,65–69 there is currently no strong evidence that
MRI can predict time to RTS.65 The individual variation in time
to RTS and different RTS definitions70 as well as low methodo-
logical quality and the considerable risk of bias in the current lit-
erature65 might be an explanation for this. Clinical findings are
more valuable for prediction of time to RTS than MRI mea-
sures, but predicting time to RTS is inaccurate for the individual
athlete.67 71 Except for (the relatively uncommon) total ham-
string rupture, not returning to sport is not a major issue in
acute hamstring injuries—close to 100% of athletes RTS after a
hamstring injury.
RTS criteria (based on published literature)
In the absence of validated objective RTS criteria, a number of
different criteria have been suggested: pain-free clinical evalu-
ation,72–74 minimal range of motion and/or strength defi-
cits,59 72 75 76 symmetrical hopping performance,72 successful
completion of a progressive rehabilitation programme and
sport-specific functional field testing,77–80 attained preinjury
sprinting
speed,60
no
apprehensions
during
full
effort
sport-specific movements73 or full-speed sprints,74 ballistic ham-
string test (eg, Askling H-test).81
Groin injury
RTS rates and time to RTS
In general, RTS rates are high (>85% returned to some form
of sport) after hip and groin injury and surgery, but these are
based on poor quality evidence.82 83 After groin injury, most
athletes RTS within 4 weeks, but this must be considered
against a high recurrence rate (15–25%).84 85 When reinjury
occurs, or if adductor and abdominal injury coexist, a longer
absence from sport can be expected.84–86 RTS times after
surgery for long-standing groin pain are similar to RTS times
after non-surgical procedures,87 but for full adductor ruptures a
faster RTS is seen with a non-surgical approach compared with
surgery.88
Factors associated with returning or not returning to sport
Reduced hip adduction strength is associated with adductor
injury, and is a strong risk factor for groin injuries in football
and ice hockey.89–92
RTS criteria (based on published literature)
Given the association between reduced strength and adductor
injury, we suggest hip adduction strength should be measured to
inform RTS decision-making.
Achilles tendon injuries (Achilles tendinopathy and Achilles
tendon rupture)
Prevalence
The Achilles tendon is one of the most injured tendons in ath-
letes involved in running and jumping activities.93 The cumula-
tive incidence (before 45 years) in male athletes is 18.2% for
Achilles tendinopathy and 5.4% for Achilles tendon rupture.94
RTS rate and time to RTS
Between 10 and 86% of athletes (athletes of various activity
levels likely explain much of the variation in RTS rates) RTS
after 12 weeks of treatment for Achilles tendinopathy.95 96 After
1 year, 55–90% RTS.97 98 However, up to 44% of people have
a recurrence of Achilles tendinopathy after RTS.99
100 After
Achilles tendon rupture, 29–87% of athletes return to their pre-
injury level.101–105
Factors associated with returning or not returning to sport
Athletes with Achilles tendinopathy who follow a standardised
load progression have fewer incidences of recurrence com-
pared with those who do not follow a progressive loading pro-
gramme.99
100 This highlights the role of the clinician in
promoting
gradual
and
progressive
loading
when
treating
patients
with
Achilles
tendinopathy.
The
pain
monitoring
model and rating of perceived exertion may give the clinician
important
clinical
cues
when
working
with
an
injured
athlete.106
After Achilles tendon rupture, permanent deficits in calf
muscle strength and tendon elongation are common.107–109 Fear
of reinjury often affects the decision to RTS after Achilles
tendon rupture, especially to the same sport in which the injury
occurred.101
RTS criteria (based on published literature)
Athletes with Achilles tendinopathy should complete a full pro-
gressive loading programme prior to clearance to RTS. Pain
should not be greater than 5/10 during activity, and pain should
subside by the next morning. Pain and stiffness are not permit-
ted to increase from week to week.110
There are no milestone-based criteria for RTS following
Achilles tendon rupture. The time-based criteria are for non-
contact sport resumption from 16 weeks following injury, and
contact sports from 20 weeks after injury.
RTS after shoulder injury
Prevalence
The average prevalence of shoulder problems in overhead ath-
letes is ∼30%, with a point prevalence of 20%. The prevalence
of substantial shoulder problems, defined as those leading to
moderate or severe reductions in sports participation or per-
formance, or to time loss, is ∼10–15%.111 112
RTS to sport rate and time to RTS
Little evidence exists regarding RTS rates or time to RTS after
shoulder injury.
Factors associated with returning or not returning to sport
Predictors of RTS after shoulder injury are unknown. Loss of
glenohumeral rotation range of motion, scapular dyskinesis and
external rotator weakness may be risk factors for shoulder
injury in athletes.113–115
RTS criteria (based on published literature)
The specific goals for rehabilitation may depend on the
sport,113
116 underscoring the importance of the clinician’s
knowledge of the sport, and working closely with coaches.
Broadly, aim for a 10% increased rotator cuff strength on the
dominant throwing side compared with the non-dominant
side,117 with external/internal rotation ratios from 65% (isokin-
etic) to 100% (isometric).118
Scapular
asymmetry
is
normal
in
overhead
athletes.119
However, scapular upward rotation and scapular stabiliser
muscle strength are hypothesised to be key factors in optimal
sports performance.120 121 Functional performance tests for the
shoulder are gaining interest. However, these tests are not yet
fully explored in clinical practice,122–125 and lack normative
data and cut-off values for injury prevention and RTS.

 Important clinical considerations are when the athlete with
shoulder pain may be permitted to throw, and how to manage
optimal loading in the overhead athlete. Graded progression of
load is critical, and must be specific to the demands of the
sport.126
127 Emerging technologies (eg, load cells) permit
accurate quantification of load during overhead activities and
may help the clinician more precisely quantify upper limb
loading during activity.128
Summary
RTS criteria for many common sports injuries are not based on
solid scientific evidence, and lack consensus. It is unknown
whether this contributes to the relative high incidence of reinju-
ries or relatively low percentage of athletes who return to their
preinjury level. It is also unclear whether fulfilling common RTS
clinical criteria predicts progression through the RTS continuum
(return to participation, RTS and return to performance).
However, absence of research evidence should not mean imme-
diate cause for despair that current practice is inadequate—there
are cases where high-quality clinical practice is associated with
excellent clinical outcomes.129 The key points regarding evi-
dence for RTS are presented in box 3.
SECTION 4: RTS RESEARCH: PRIORITIES AND FUTURE
DIRECTIONS
Priority: providing clear definitions
Future studies reporting RTS outcomes should include clear
definitions of injuries sustained, adopting any relevant inter-
national consensus on the reporting, categorisation and diagno-
sis
(eg,
the
‘Scapular
Summit’
consensus
on
scapular
dyskinesis130 or the Doha agreement on terminology and defini-
tions in groin pain).131 It is also important to provide clear defi-
nitions of what constitutes reinjury, ideally using published
guidelines.132
A clear definition of RTS is important, and researchers should
consider using the RTS continuum (figure 1) as a basis for their
definition. In some research contexts it may be necessary to
elaborate on some elements of the RTS continuum. For
example, for return to participation, to report the number of
athletes who return to a different sport than their preinjury or
the number who return to the preinjury sport but at a lower
level (eg, was playing national competition basketball, now
playing in a regional competition). Researchers should also
report the number of athletes who stop playing sport.
Priority: quantifying RTS
Participation and performance
Many elite level sports regularly use metrics to quantify per-
formance (eg, metres gained, goals/points scored, assists) that
may be helpful in describing performance outcomes for team
sports (eg, American football, baseball, soccer) and some indi-
vidual sports (eg, cycling and triathlon times). Various aspects of
load can be readily quantified by the Global Positioning Systems
(GPS), gyroscopes and accelerometers, and offer an interesting
opportunity to benchmark performance levels, quantify load
and performance, and set sport-specific targets for RTS.133 134
Challenges lie in determining the relevance of specific measures
to RTS as well as the reliability and availability of these data.
Nevertheless, it is a rapidly developing and exciting field. To
complement these objective measures, it is also important to
consider subjective measures of acute and chronic training
loads.135
Follow-up duration
Long-term follow-up is needed to examine the impact of injury
on long-term participation in sport. The length of follow-up
needs to be relevant to the injury studied (eg, after Bankart
repair, 1 year might be considered short-term follow-up, while
after muscle injury, 1 year might be considered long-term
follow-up), and defined in advance by the researcher. Given that
a sizeable proportion of athletes cease participation in their pre-
injury sport by the medium-term following injury,82 136 it is an
important avenue for future research to establish whether these
athletes retire from sport or whether they change sports.
Satisfaction and confidence in RTS
Reasons for participating or not participating in sport vary
greatly
between
different
populations
and
sporting
activities.27 137 Future studies should seek to establish why some
athletes do not RTS and if non-return is related to reasons for
playing sport initially, and explore whether athletes are satisfied
with their postinjury participation.
(Re)Injury risk after RTS
Consistent reporting of impairment-based and activity-based
measures, and patient
(athlete)-reported outcome measures
during recovery and rehabilitation may help identify subgroups
at high, moderate and low risk of reinjury. Early identification
of these subgroups may allow targeted interventions to address
risk factors (eg, specific strengthening programmes to address
subcomponents of strength or psychological input for at-risk
groups), which may result in better long-term outcomes.
Quantification of risk may help categorise athletes who are not
ready to RTS, those who require supervision, and those who are
ready to RTS.
Priority: Identify prognostic factors for RTS outcome
Table 1 summarises some of the key factors that may influence
RTS outcome and highlights the multifactorial nature of RTS.
Interrelationships between factors and the impact of these rela-
tionships
on
RTS
remain
unclear,
and
warrant
further
investigation.
Priority: Identify and validate tests to guide RTS
decision-making
T
ests may be performed prior to injury as a benchmark, then at
four key time points: (1) immediately after injury (ie, diagnostic
tests), (2) through the course of rehabilitation (to monitor pro-
gression), (3) at the time of clearance to RTS, (4) after RTS to
Box 3
Key take home messages regarding the evidence
for return to sport (RTS)
▸ Time to RTS varies independent of the type and severity of
injury, reflecting the challenge in accurately predicting injury
prognosis and RTS timelines.
▸ RTS decisions should always use information gathered from
a battery of tests mimicking the reactive elements and the
decision-making steps athletes use in real sport situations.
▸ Workload may be linked to reinjury, so should be taken into
consideration when making RTS decisions.
▸ Psychological factors should be taken into account during
rehabilitation and at the time the athlete is making the
transition back to sport.
▸ Consensus is needed regarding the RTS criteria for common
athletic injuries.

 measure performance and reinjury risk. Future studies to con-
sider the prognostic validity of clinical tests for RTS and rein-
jury are underway.
Areas that warrant further investigation to establish the rela-
tionship
to
RTS
outcomes
and
interrelationships
between
factors
include
strength,
range
of
motion,
neuromuscular
control, psychosocial factors and skill execution.
Strength
The role of strength and its subqualities (eg, power, rate of force
development, endurance) in RTS outcomes remains unclear for
many injuries.80 138 Future studies should consider the influence
of rate of force development, eccentric strength and strength
endurance on RTS outcomes.139–141
Range of motion (including flexibility and pain-provocation
stretch tests)
Research investigating the influence of range of motion on RTS
outcomes has been largely equivocal, although there is evidence
in baseball players of a relationship between shoulder injury and
glenohumeral internal and external rotation deficits.113 142 143
Future studies should evaluate the role of sport-specific range of
motion through multiplanar functional movements.
Neuromuscular control
Some evidence exists on the role of neuromuscular control in
reinjury.140 144 145 However, tests that are commonly used to
determine whether the athlete is ready to RTS (eg, single-leg
hop test and the Y balance test) lack sensitivity,146 are predict-
able, and controlled by the athlete. Future studies should
examine the role of more challenging tests associated with
sport-specific skills, and consider the sensitivity of dynamic
functional tests and reactive agility (ie, unexpected/unpredictable
challenges) in predicting RTS outcomes.147
Psychological factors
Most of the research examining the impact of psychological
factors on RTS has been of cross-sectional design. Future studies
should use prognostic designs to consider the temporal relation-
ship between key psychological factors and RTS. Another
important question to consider is whether interventions that
target psychological factors can change RTS outcomes.
Performance and skill execution
Future studies should assess performance measures associated
with the athlete’s sport. Ideally, this research should include
objective (eg, GPS, game statistics) and subjective measures of
loading and performance (eg, session rate of perceived exertion,
satisfaction).
Methodological considerations
Using consistent tests and descriptions will improve the ability
to make comparisons between studies. It might then be possible
to perform meta-analyses and compare across a variety of sports
and subgroups.
Future studies should identify, a priori, the appropriate size
of the cohort and the duration of follow-up. Blinded designs
are encouraged, especially when using subjective outcome mea-
sures. Studies should also seek to articulate the statistical and
clinical significance of results. Researchers are encouraged
to follow reporting guidelines for different study types such as
PRISMA148
for
systematic
reviews
and
meta-analyses,
CONSORT149 for randomised trials and STROBE150 for obser-
vational studies. For more details on research reporting guide-
lines visit http://www.equator-network.org
Future directions: key research priorities
There are many avenues to be pursued in future research. In
box 4 we provide some recommendations on priorities for
future RTS research.
CONCLUSIONS
Combining information from a biological, psychological and
social standpoint, while considering the risks can help all RTS
decision-makers—whether they be clinicians, athletes, coaches
or other stakeholders—make optimal decisions. Integrating clin-
ical expertise, research evidence and athlete preferences is
important for RTS decision-making and for longer-term RTS
success. RTS criteria for many common injuries are not based
on solid scientific evidence. Future research should focus on
a standardised approach to defining, measuring and reporting
of RTS outcomes, and on identifying the prognostic factors
for RTS.
