We built a SEIR (susceptible, exposed, infected, recov-
ered) model of smallpox transmission for New York, New 
York, USA, and Sydney, New South Wales, Australia, that 
accounted for age-specific population immunosuppression 
and residual vaccine immunity and conducted sensitiv-
ity analyses to estimate the effect these parameters might 
have on smallpox reemergence. At least 19% of New York’s 
and 17% of Sydney’s population are immunosuppressed. 
The highest smallpox infection rates were in persons 0–19 
years of age, but the highest death rates were in those >45 
years of age. Because of the low level of residual vaccine 
immunity, immunosuppression was more influential than 
vaccination on death and infection rates in our model. De-
spite widespread smallpox vaccination until 1980 in New 
York, smallpox outbreak severity appeared worse in New 
York than in Sydney. Immunosuppression is highly preva-
lent and should be considered in future smallpox outbreak 
models because excluding this factor probably underesti-
mates death and infection rates.
S
mallpox virus was eradicated in 1980 but remains a cat-
egory A bioterrorism agent (1). The only official stocks 
of the virus are in the United States and Russia (2), but 
unofficial stocks could be present elsewhere. Advances in 
synthetic biology of poxviruses and availability of the full 
variola genome sequence make synthesis of smallpox virus 
in the laboratory possible (3). Smallpox could reemerge as 
a result of bioterrorism or a laboratory accident (4); thus, 
smallpox is a high priority for preparedness planning (5). 
Given that smallpox is eradicated, mathematical models 
enable researchers to predict the effects of a smallpox epi-
demic, but these predictions depend critically on the as-
sumptions of the mathematical model.
Many researchers who have developed smallpox mod-
els have been optimistic about residual vaccine-induced 
immunity and assumed a case-fatality ratio (CFR) of 30%, 
whereas estimates of outbreaks in nonimmune populations 
suggest a CFR of 50%–70% (6). Given the absence of 
smallpox in the world for nearly 40 years and loss of im-
munologic boosting from wild-type infection, the CFR of 
an epidemic today might be higher.
The immunologic status of the population has also 
changed dramatically in the decades since smallpox eradi-
cation. A larger proportion of the population today is un-
vaccinated, and residual immunity in persons who were 
vaccinated before 1980 is waning (7). In addition, the prev-
alence of HIV, advances in transplantation, and therapies 
for cancer and many autoimmune conditions have resulted 
in unprecedented rates of immunosuppression (8). In 1980, 
when smallpox was eradicated, HIV had not yet manifested 
a high global burden of disease. Similarly, bone marrow 
transplantation was in its infancy, and heart–lung trans-
plantations had not yet occurred. The fact that the propor-
tion of unvaccinated and immunosuppressed persons in the 
population is increasing has not yet been adequately con-
sidered in estimations of the effect of reemergent smallpox.
Persons born after 1980 have no immunity to small-
pox because they have never been exposed to wild-type 
virus or been vaccinated. For vaccinated cohorts, immu-
nity wanes over time, and the highest protection is present 
during the first 5 years after vaccination, possibly waning 
to zero within 5–10 years (9). Furthermore, immunose-
nescence is a predictable, exponential decline in immune 
function that occurs after 50 years of age (10) and reduces 
the body’s ability to fight infection and respond to vaccines 
(11). This phenomenon further adds to immunosuppression 
in countries with an aging population. The aim of this study 
was to estimate the effect of reemerging smallpox in New 
York, New York, USA, and Sydney, New South Wales,

 Immunosuppression and Smallpox Reemergence
Australia, 2 large cities with different vaccination histories 
for which estimates could be made on the population’s im-
munologic status.
Methods
Population
We used Sydney’s population in 2015 (12), which was es-
timated using data from the state of New South Wales (13). 
The New York population of the same year was derived 
from the relevant statistical collection (14). We divided 
both populations into 5-year age groups up through ages 
80–84 years and combined the eldest (persons >84 years 
of age) into a single group (Figure 1, panel A). Each age 
group was divided into vaccinated and unvaccinated com-
partments, which were then further subdivided into 3 cat-
egories of immunity: immunocompetent, mildly immuno-
suppressed, and moderate-to-severely immunosuppressed. 
We assumed that immunosuppressed persons had no resid-
ual immunity from vaccination.
Immunosuppressed Population
We considered common types of immunosuppression esti-
mated in an influenza study (15). We classified persons into 
2 categories of immunosuppression: moderate to severe 
(called severe in our model) and mild. Severe immunosup-
pression was defined as a condition in which quantifiable 
data existed to demonstrate a risk for infection more than 
twice that of an immunocompetent person. This classifica-
tion was left as a single category in the absence of reliable 
methodology to subdivide it. Mild immunosuppression was 
defined as a condition in which immunosuppression was 
documented but susceptibility to infection was estimated 
to be less than twice that of an immunocompetent host. For 
the analysis, persons with severe immunosuppression were 
assumed to have 2× and mild immunosuppression 1.5× the 
susceptibility to infection of a healthy person (16).
We sourced data for each city, and when only coun-
trywide data were available, we attributed rates from 
the countrywide data set to the respective fraction of the 
population in the city. When age-specific immunosuppres-
sion prevalence data were not available, we used yearly 
 
age-specific incidence data instead to calculate prevalence 
age distribution (17,18).
We estimated the populations living with cancer 
(17,19), HIV (20,21), organ transplants (22,23), respiratory 
syndromes such as asthma (24,25) and chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (26,27), dialysis (28,29), and autoim-
mune diseases (30,31) and divided these populations into 
the 2 immunosuppression categories for each city (online 
Technical Appendix Table 1, https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/EID/
article/24/4/17-1233-Techapp1.pdf). We acknowledge that 
many other diseases are associated with immunosuppres-
sion. Our method underestimates the amount of immuno-
suppression in the population.
Vaccine-Induced Residual Immunity
In the United States, including New York, widespread 
smallpox vaccination occurred until 1970 (32). In con-
trast, in the geographically isolated island continent of 
Australia, quarantine was used to protect the population 
because smallpox was never endemic (32). Widespread 
vaccination never occurred in Australia; only the armed 
forces and healthcare workers were vaccinated, which 
occurred until 1979, although reactive vaccination cam-
paigns had been conducted during a smallpox outbreak in 
Sydney in 1917 (33).
For New York, we assumed 80% of the healthy popu-
lation 40–69 years of age (born before 1975) were previ-
ously vaccinated. For Sydney, we estimated the proportion 
of persons vaccinated by estimating those born before 1980 
in the following groups: healthcare workers in Sydney in 
2015 (34), members of the defense forces, and migrants 
(>30% in the Sydney population) (35), who might have 
been vaccinated in their country of origin (≈80,000 per-
sons). We estimated that, in Sydney, at most 30% of the 
total population born before 1980 (persons 35–69 years of 
age) had been vaccinated. On the basis of a mathematical 
model (36) that estimated waning immunity against severe 
smallpox as 1.41% per year after vaccination, we calcu-
lated the age-specific residual protection for vaccinated 
persons 40–69 years of age by multiplying that percentage 
by the number of years from vaccination and subtracting it 
from 100% starting protection.

 RESEARCH
Contact Mixing
In our model, we used the heterogeneous age-specific contact 
rates from the European mixing patterns study (37). We as-
sumed that persons would greatly reduce their social contacts 
after becoming symptomatic with smallpox (38). To account 
for this change in social contact, we modified the normal 
contact matrix, multiplying the matrix by a factor (0 < x < 1) 
to reduce the number of contacts per day (39). Because of the 
lack of studies quantifying this reduction, we assumed x to be 
0.5, as in a previous study (39). Considering severe smallpox 
types are more substantially prostrating, we applied the re-
duced contact matrix to hemorrhagic and flat smallpox infec-
tions from the first day of illness. For ordinary smallpox, we 
assumed the behavior change started on the second day and 
for vaccine-modified smallpox, on the third day.
Disease Types
We categorized smallpox disease into 4 different types defined 
by infectivity (R0) and CFRs: hemorrhagic, flat, ordinary, and 
vaccine-modified. Age-specific and other model parameters 
(online Technical Appendix Table 2) as well as further model 
details are explained in the online Technical Appendix.
Smallpox Disease Type Distribution
We assumed infected persons had different probabilities of 
developing each disease type, depending on their age and 
immunologic status. The incidence of each disease type 
within each age group for healthy unvaccinated persons 
was drawn from historical outbreaks (9) (online Techni-
cal Appendix Table 3). For healthy unvaccinated persons, 
hemorrhagic smallpox ratios ranged from 7 cases/1,000 
persons infected (in the 5–9-year age group) to 200 cas-
es/1,000 persons infected (in the >85-year age group). Flat 
smallpox age-specific rates were lowest for the 10–14-year 
age group (30 cases/1,000 persons infected) and reached 
180 cases/1,000 persons infected for the oldest age group. 
For the mildly immunocompromised population, we dou-
bled the age-specific probability of hemorrhagic and flat 
smallpox. We assumed 100% of severely immunocom-
promised persons would develop hemorrhagic disease. We 
assumed the vaccinated subgroup had reduced susceptibil-
ity and rates of severe smallpox types. We estimated that 
25.3% of vaccinated persons would get vaccine-modified 
smallpox (9). We applied a waning immunity function over 
time at a rate of 1.41% per year from vaccination (36) and 
assumed the rates of hemorrhagic and flat smallpox would 
increase with time from vaccination while rates of vaccine-
modified smallpox would decrease with time from vaccina-
tion (online Technical Appendix Table 4).
Mathematical Model
We constructed a modified SEIR (susceptible, exposed, in-
fected, recovered) model for smallpox transmission (online 
 
Technical Appendix Table 2). The population was divided 
into vaccinated and unvaccinated compartments, which 
were then further subdivided into 3 categories of immu-
nity: immunocompetent, mildly immunosuppressed, and 
moderate-to-severely immunosuppressed. The model used 
ordinary differential equations to move populations into 
epidemiologic states related to their smallpox infectious 
status: susceptible, infected, prodromal, infectious, re-
covered, or dead. Once infected, populations were moved 
into the next state on the basis of disease duration rates. 
To obtain the age-specific force of infection (i.e., the rate 
at which susceptible persons acquire smallpox), we used 
the Euler approximation to make discrete contact rates, as-
suming the rates were proportional to the patterns observed 
in the United Kingdom. Then, to account for the different 
infectivity rates of different smallpox types, we estimated 
the transmission parameter β (i.e., the probability of getting 
infected from a contact) for each smallpox disease type to 
calculate the R0 for hemorrhagic, flat, ordinary, and vac-
cine-modified smallpox. Finally, we multiplied the force of 
infection by a parameter (α1, α2, α3, α4; online Technical Ap-
pendix Table 2) to account for the different susceptibility 
levels of different populations.
The model ran for 100 simulated days. We assumed 
an attack in a crowded public space, such as an airport, and 
 
started the epidemic with 51 infected in New York and 29 
in Sydney to reflect the same attack rate for each popula-
tion. We assumed a dynamic population updated each day 
using the birth (40) and age-specific death rates (41,42) 
from 2014 for both cities.
Sensitivity Analysis
We conducted a sensitivity analysis on the assumption of 
waning immunity, reducing immunity by 0.7% per year 
(approximately half the value used in the base case scenario 
[i.e., the first scenario discussed]). We present results for 3 
different assumptions about residual vaccine immunity: no 
residual immunity, base case immunity (1.41% waning im-
munity per year), and high residual immunity (0.7% wan-
ing immunity per year). We also conducted a sensitivity 
analysis to test the model outputs without considering pop-
ulation immunosuppression, which has been the approach 
in most past models (43).
Results
Population and Immunity Levels
We examined the population age distributions of New 
York and Sydney. Sydney has a higher percentage of per-
sons <20 and >55 years of age than New York (Figure 
1, panel A), whereas New York has a higher proportion 
of persons 20–39 years of age than Sydney. We esti-
mated that 4.54% of New York’s population and 3.76% 
648

of Sydney’s population are severely immunocompro-
mised, 14.81% of New York’s population and 12.95% 
of Sydney’s population are mildly immunocompromised, 
59.14% of New York’s population and 72.56% of Syd-
ney’s population are healthy unvaccinated, and 21.51% of 
New York’s population and 10.73% of Sydney’s popula-
tion are healthy vaccinated. Similar proportions of the 2 
cities’ populations (19% in New York and 17% in Syd-
ney) are immunosuppressed (Figure 1, panel B). New 
York has a higher proportion of the population vaccinated 
(21%) than Sydney (10%).
Base Case Scenario
We analyzed age-specific infection (Figure 2, panel A) and 
death (Figure 2, panel B) rates using the base case scenario 
(medium immunity level) including the immunosuppressed 
population. Persons 5–19 years of age are at highest risk 
for smallpox infection in both cities (Figure 2, panel A). 
Although the proportion of persons infected in both cities is 
similar among the 0–19-year age groups, ≈25% more per-
sons in New York than Sydney become infected among the 
20–39-year age groups.
Cumulative deaths per 1,000 population increase with 
age starting with persons >20 years of age (Figure 2, panel 
B). Deaths peak in the 65–69-year age group in both cities, 
reaching 1.2 deaths/1,000 population for New York and 0.9 
deaths/1,000 population for Sydney 60 days after the start 
of the outbreak; rates increase again in those >80 years of 
age. The New York population also has a smaller peak in 
deaths in the 35–39-year age group. Although the spread 
of infection is mostly driven by higher contact rates among 
persons of young age groups, the peaks in death reflect the 
distribution of the immunosuppressed population (Figure 
1, panel B; Figure 2, panel B). The effect of residual im-
munity is more apparent in New York trends, which show a 
greater decrease in infections and cumulative deaths in the 
age groups that were previously vaccinated (40–65 years 
of age).
Looking at total rates over time, New York (Fig-
ure 3, panels A, C) and Sydney (Figure 3, panels B, D) 
have similar exponential growths of infection rates, with 
slightly higher trends for New York. The rate of infection 
 
reaches 0.094 infected/1,000 population for New York 
and 0.084 infected/1,000 population for Sydney 50 days 
after the smallpox introduction and increases to 0.496 
infected/1,000 population for New York and 0.452 in-
fected/1,000 population for Sydney by 70 days. The 
death rates are 0.028 deaths/1,000 population for New 
York and 0.025 deaths/1,000 population for Sydney af-
ter 50 days and reach 0.151 deaths/1,000 population for 
New York and 0.133 deaths/1,000 population for Syd-
ney by 70 days.
Residual Immunity Analysis
Infection and death rate estimates for New York, where 
vaccine coverage is more than double that of Sydney, are 
more sensitive to assumptions of residual immunity. New 
York (Figure 3, panel A) has lower rates of infection than 
Sydney (Figure 3, panel B) only in the scenario of high re-
sidual immunity. At day 50 of the outbreak, rates are ≈15% 
(base case residual immunity) and 31% (high residual im-
munity) lower in New York and 10% (base case residual 
immunity) and 17% (high residual immunity) lower in 
Sydney with residual immunity than without residual im-
munity. Differences in infection and death rates among dif-
ferent residual immunity assumptions increased with time. 
Regarding the impact on age-specific rates in New York 
(Figure 4, panel A) and Sydney (Figure 4, panel B), the as-
sumption of high residual immunity produced lower death 
rates for the older age groups.
Immunosuppression Analysis
Infection and death rates increase when including (vs. ex-
cluding) immunosuppression parameters in the model; 
greater differences are seen between New York’s infection 
rates (Figure 3, panel C) and Sydney’s infection rates (Fig-
ure 3, panel D). The difference in rates increases with time, 
reaching ≈20% in New York and 18% in Sydney at day 
50 from the start of the outbreak and 28% for New York 
and 25% for Sydney at day 70. Although including immu-
nosuppression estimates into the model produced similarly 
higher infection rates for each age group (less for the 0–4-
year age group), differences in death rates increased with 
age (Figure 4).

Discussion
With each passing year, population immunosuppression is 
a more influential determinant than residual vaccine immu-
nity of the severity of a smallpox epidemic. Although the 
spread of disease is highest in younger age groups, driven 
mostly by their higher contact rates, higher death rates were 
seen in older populations, reflecting the prevalence of im-
munosuppression.
The differences between New York, which has high 
vaccination coverage (an estimated ≈22% of the popula-
tion), and Sydney, which has low (≈10%) vaccination cov-
erage, demonstrate that residual immunity assumptions 
are not as influential in Sydney as in New York. However, 
the consideration of population immunosuppression, from 
medical conditions to iatrogenic factors, strongly affects 
disease transmission and deaths in both cities. This large 
population subset must be considered when modeling the 
impact of any infectious disease outbreak. We estimated 
conservatively that almost 1 in 5 persons in New York and 
1 in 6 persons in Sydney (and higher for the 60–64-year 
age group) are living with some degree of immunosuppres-
sion. Although New York has higher rates of immunosup-
pression for the 25–84-year age groups, Sydney has higher 
rates than New York for the youngest (0–19 years) and the 
oldest (>85) populations.
Residual immunity affects age-specific infection and 
death rates, with both cities showing the highest infec-
tion rates for unvaccinated young persons 5–19 years of 
age. However, death rates rise after 40 years of age, de-
spite higher vaccination coverage in this age group. For 
Sydney, even an assumption of higher immunity does 
not affect the infection or death rates greatly because of 
the low vaccine coverage before 1980. However, resid-
ual immunity becomes more influential if we use more 
optimistic assumptions of waning immunity. Note that 
persons who have been vaccinated would mount a more 
robust and rapid response to revaccination in the event of 
an outbreak and might be better protected after postex-
posure vaccination. Obtaining a vaccination history and 
checking for a consistent scar are necessary parts of out-
break management.
Although immunosuppression is a major determinant 
of the size and distribution of a smallpox outbreak, this fact 
should not be a major determinant of vaccination policy. 
Immunosuppression should continue to be an absolute con-
traindication for vaccination of persons who are not true 
contacts. Ensuring that persons with immunosuppression 
(including healthcare workers) avoid contact with persons 
with smallpox (if possible) should be a priority. Smallpox 
would always be more pathogenic than vaccinia virus, so 
any patient with a bona fide exposure to smallpox should 
be vaccinated with a fully potent vaccinia strain, such as 
ACAM2000 (44). If such patient develops a serious com-
plication, such as eczema vaccinatum or progressive vac-
cinia, the patient can be treated with ST-246 (Siga Tech-
nologies, New York, NY, USA) (45).

 Immunosuppression and Smallpox Reemergence
Our study is subject to some limitations. We used an 
underestimate of immunosuppression; other conditions 
causing immunosuppression, such as diabetes, were not 
considered. We also used conservative estimates for the 
increased risk for infection in immunosuppressed persons 
and grouped persons with severe and moderate immuno-
suppression into single categories because of the absence 
of more specific data to categorize them further by degree 
of immunosuppression. The contact matrix we used was 
estimated in a study conducted in the United Kingdom 
in 2006, which might not necessarily reflect New York 
or Sydney social contact patterns (37). Furthermore, con-
tacts with symptomatic infectious patients will probably 
drop to near zero once an outbreak has been confirmed 
and patients are well isolated, assuming adequate health 
system capacity for isolation and treatment of smallpox 
patients. The data in the model on age-specific rates of 
smallpox were obtained from hospitalized patients (9), 
which might overestimate the rates of severe disease in 
the model outputs.
The speed and vigor with which smallpox control ef-
forts are implemented should be major aspects of control 
efforts and need to be tested in a model that accounts ad-
equately for immunosuppression. Ensuring adequate hos-
pital care and isolation facilities will also help in epidemic 
control. During the Ebola epidemic in West Africa, lack of 
beds resulted in widespread community transmission, and 
modeling showed that 70% of patients needed to be in treat-
ment facilities to control the epidemic (46). The response 
to severe acute respiratory syndrome, with its rapid control 
despite the lack of a vaccine or antiviral agent, showed that 
patient isolation can be very successful (47). Experiences 
with severe acute respiratory syndrome, Ebola, and Mid-
dle East respiratory syncytial coronavirus also illustrate 
the heavy toll on healthcare workers (48), who should be 
assumed to be at high risk for infection in the event of a 
smallpox outbreak.
Given waning smallpox vaccine immunity (nearly 4 
decades since eradication and a dwindling vaccinated pop-
ulation), the influence of population immunosuppression is

greater than that of residual vaccine immunity, yet has not 
been adequately considered in smallpox epidemic model-
ing. Advances in medicine and new endemic diseases, such 
as HIV, have resulted in almost 1 in 5 persons living with 
immunosuppression in large metropolitan cities. Immuno-
suppression must be considered in preparedness planning 
and poses a challenge for vaccination strategies during po-
tential smallpox outbreaks.
