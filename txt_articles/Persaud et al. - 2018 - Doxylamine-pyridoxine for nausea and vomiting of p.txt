Abstract
Background
Doxylamine-pyridoxine is recommended as a first line treatment for nausea and vomiting
during pregnancy and it is commonly prescribed. We re-analysed the findings of a previ-
ously reported superiority trial of doxylamine-pyridoxine for the treatment of nausea and
vomiting during pregnancy using the clinical study report obtained from Health Canada.
Methods and findings
We re-analysed individual level data for a parallel arm randomized controlled trial that was
conducted in six outpatient obstetrical practices in the United States. Pregnant women
between 7 and 14 weeks of gestation with moderate nausea and vomiting of pregnancy
symptoms. The active treatment was a tablet containing both doxylamine 10 mg and pyri-
doxine 10 mg taken between 2 and 4 times per day for 14 days depending on symptoms.
The control was an identical placebo tablet taken using the same instructions. The primary
outcome measure was improvement in nausea and vomiting of symptoms scores using the
13-point pregnancy unique quantification of emesis scale between baseline and 14 days
using an ANCOVA. 140 participants were randomized into each group. Data for 131 active
treatment participants and 125 control participants were analysed. On the final day of the
trial, 101 active treatment participants and 86 control participants provided primary outcome
measures.
There was greater improvement in symptoms scores with doxylamine-pyridoxine com-
pared with placebo (0.73 points; 95% CI 0.21 to 1.25) when last observation carried forward
imputation was used for missing data but the difference is not statistically significant using
other approaches to missing data (e.g. 0.38; 95% CI -0.08 to 0.84 using complete data).

 Conclusions
There is a trend towards efficacy for nausea and vomiting symptoms with doxylamine-pyri-
doxine compared with placebo but the statistical significance of the difference depends on
the method of handling missing data and the magnitude of the difference suggests that
there is no clinically important benefit employing the prespecified minimal clinically important
difference or “expected difference” of 3 points.
Trial registration
Clinical Trial NCT00614445
Introduction
Doxylamine-pyridoxine (Diclectin, Diclegis; formerly Bendectin and Debendox) is commonly
prescribed for the treatment of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy.[1–3] One published ran-
domized controlled trial (RCT) of doxylamine-pyridoxine versus placebo, DIC-301, has been
relied on as evidence of efficacy.[4] This RCT led to approval of the combination product by
the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA),[5] is cited in support of a clinical
practice guideline recommendation for doxylamine-pyridoxine as the first line (grade I-A)
treatment for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy[6] and is included in a Cochrane Collabora-
tion systematic review.[7] The results of this trial have been reported in several publications
between 2010 and 2016 [4, 8, 9] and a summary of a United States FDA review is also publicly
available.[5] All of these previous reports conclude that doxylamine-pyridoxine is efficacious.
The previous reports include different descriptions of the methodology and the outcomes.
According to clinical trial reporting guidelines, trials should either be conducted according
to a prespecified protocol or, if there is good reason for changing the protocol, the reasons for
changes should be reported.[10] In order to prevent selective reporting or misreporting, pre-
specified methodologies must be compared with reported results.[11–15] Publishing re-analy-
ses of abandoned or misreported studies is now a recognized way to ensure research findings
are used properly to improve care.[16]
The primary objective of DIC-301 was to compare the efficacy of doxylamine-pyridoxine to
placebo in the treatment of nausea and vomiting during pregnancy. We present previously
unpublished information about the methods and results of DIC-301 from the clinical study
report that was submitted to Health Canada. A reanalysis is justified because there are differ-
ences between the previous reports of this trial [4, 9], this trial was pivotal in leading to United
States FDA approval [5] and this medication is commonly prescribed [1–3] consistent with its
guideline recommended first-line use.[6]
Methods
Data sources for prespecified analyses and re-analysis
We re-analysed participant level data from the DIC-301 trial according to the RIAT initiative.
[16] We contacted the original authors and the journal that published two prior reports of this
trial. We used three sources of information about the prespecified analyses: publicly posted
trial registration information, clinical study report documents obtained from Health Canada,
and publicly posted review documents from the FDA. We describe the trial methodology
based on these sources as well as the published articles about this trial.

had no role in study design, data collection and
analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the
manuscript.
Competing interests: Dr El Emam reports personal
fees from Privacy Analytics, outside the submitted
work. This does not alter our adherence to PLOS
ONE policies on sharing data and materials. There
are no patents, products in development, or
marketed products to declare.
 We obtained individual participant level data from a .pdf file of the clinical study report
from Health Canada. We converted the data tables in the obtained .pdf file into .doc and .xls
files and then used the R statistical computing environment to clean and format the data.[17]
We compared findings with those reported in the only two articles where the stated purpose
is to report the efficacy results of the trial.[4, 9]
For adverse events, we compared findings with those in the article about maternal safety
results from the trial [8] and the information posted on the trial registration website.
Design
This was a parallel, individual participant 1:1 randomized, superiority, multicenter, double-
blind placebo controlled trial.
Changes to protocol
The timing of primary outcome ascertainment, the analysis plan for the primary outcome, the
secondary outcomes, and the sample size justification were apparently changed after the study
was completed although it is unclear if changes to the analysis plan were made prior to initiat-
ing analysis. These changes are discussed in detail below and some are listed in Table A and
Table B in S1 File.
Participants and setting
Pregnant women aged 18 years or older with a gestational age between 7 and 14 weeks with
nausea and vomiting or pregnancy symptoms (NVP) of at least 6 on the pregnancy unique
quantification of emesis scale (PUQE score) despite conservative treatment were recruited
from six university medical centres in the United States. Inclusion and exclusion criteria are
listed in Box 1.
The six sites were the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, the University of
Texas Medical Branch Obstetrical Regional Maternal Clinic in Pasadena, University of Texas
Medical Branch Regional Maternal & Child Health Program Clinic in Pearland, Magee Wom-
en’s Hospital in Pittsburgh, Washington Hospital Centre in Washington DC, and Georgetown
Medical University in Washington DC.
Patient involvement.
Apparently there was no involvement of patients in the design of
study. We did not involve patients in the re-analysis.
Interventions
The study drug was either a combination tablet containing 10 mg of doxylamine and 10 mg of
pyridoxine (vitamin B6) in a delayed-release formulation or a placebo.
Participants were instructed to take two tablets of the study drug on the first night of the
study. If nausea and vomiting symptoms persisted (PUQE > 3) during the afternoon of day 2,
participants were instructed to take an additional tablet on the morning of day 3. The need for
an additional afternoon tablet was made during a clinic assessment on day 4 ± 1 (with a thresh-
old of PUQE > 3). In summary, participants were instructed to take between 2 and 4 tablets
daily according to their symptoms.
Primary outcome and changes
According to the clinical study report, the “the primary efficacy endpoint was the change from
baseline in PUQE score at Day 15 (± 1 day). Change from baseline was calculated as post-base-
line score minus baseline score.”

 Box 1. Inclusion and exclusion criteria (clinical study report, page
24)
Inclusion criteria
Subjects were eligible for study inclusion if they met all of the following inclusion
criteria:
1. The subject had signed a written informed consent to participate in the study and
had agreed to follow dosing instructions and complete all required study visits.
2. The subject was a pregnant female age equal to or greater than 18 years old.
3. The subject’s entry ultrasound indicated a viable pregnancy and confirmed gesta-
tional age of the fetus was 7–14 weeks at the anticipated time of the first dose of
study medication or placebo. If an ultrasound was done within 4 weeks of the
admission visit, and results could be obtained, an additional ultrasound was not
necessary.
4. The subject was suffering from NVP and had a PUQE score �6.
5. The subject had not responded to conservative management consisting of dietary/
lifestyle advice according to the 2004 ACOG Practice Bulletin.
6. The subject agreed, if on a multivitamin, to continue on their current dose of mul-
tivitamin for the duration of the trial.
7. The subject did not plan termination of the pregnancy.
Exclusion criteria
Subjects were excluded from study participation if they met any of the following exclu-
sion criteria:
1. The investigator confirmed the subject’s nausea and vomiting was of etiology
other than NVP.
2. The subject had gestational trophoblastic disease or multifetal gestation.
3. The subject had a condition for which antihistamines, in the opinion of the inves-
tigator, were contraindicated (epilepsy, alcoholism, glaucoma, chronic lung dis-
ease, urinary retention, heart block, etc.).
4. The subject had used antihistamines, anticholinergics, dopamine antagonists,
serotonin antagonists, ginger, or anti-emetic therapy (including acupressure, acu-
puncture, homeopathic remedies, medical hypnosis, relief bands, etc.) to treat
NVP in the previous 48 hours or planned to do so during the study.
5. The subject was using drugs that had anticholinergic activity (e.g., tricyclic
antidepressants).

 Minor changes to the timing of primary outcome ascertainment were made and the quality
of life score is also described as a primary outcome in a 2016 report (see Table C in S1 File).
Secondary outcomes and changes
The secondary outcomes were: the three subscores of the PUQE, global assessment of wellbe-
ing, number of tablets taken, time loss from household tasks and/or employment, total number
of visits and phone calls to health care providers, rates of hyperemesis gravidarum and compli-
ance with study medication.
The secondary outcomes were reported differently in two published articles (see Table D
and Table E in S1 File).
Sample size estimation
The sample size seems to be based on a clinically important difference of 3 on the 13-point
PUQE score between groups, power of 90%, and an alpha of 0.001. The source cited is an RCT
of ginger versus pyridoxine for the treatment of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy. Different
justifications of the sample size are presented in different sources (see Table F in S1 File).
Interim analyses
No interim analyses or stopping rules were described.
Randomization: Sequence generation, type and allocation concealment
mechanism
According to the clinical study report, “study drug was provided according to a computer-gen-
erated randomization code in blocks of a predetermined number of subjects. Block size was
not disclosed to study center or study management personnel. If the subject was withdrawn
from the study prior to Day 15 for any reason or in the event of an emergency, the site was to
contact the medical monitor before breaking the blind. The randomization code was provided
to the site by the interactive voice recording system. Subjects were assigned study medication
sequentially, in the order of enrollment.”
6. The subject was taking multivitamins containing more than 10 mg of vitamin B6,
or planned to do so during the study.
7. The subject was taking supplementary vitamin B6 in addition to any multivitamin
preparation, or planned to do so during the study.
8. The subject was currently drinking any amount of alcohol.
9. The subject had any condition that might have interfered with the conduct of the
study.
10. The subject was likely to be unable to comply with study procedures because of
inadequate cognitive skills.
11. The subject had received an investigational drug within 30 days before enroll-
ment in this study or was scheduled to receive an investigational drug during the
course of this study.

 Blinding
The trial was described as “double-blind” and this presumably means that patient and clini-
cians were blinded to group assignment.
Similarity of interventions
According to the clinical study report, “the placebo tablets were of identical in size, shape,
taste, and color” as the doxylamine-pyridoxine tablets and only the lot number differed.
Statistical re-analysis: Data extraction
We obtained the clinical study reports including individual participant level data from Health
Canada under a confidentiality agreement. We extracted the individual level participant data
that was provided by Health Canada in the form of .pdf file with multiple data tables in two
ways: (1) by manually copying and pasting relevant data elements into a spreadsheet and (2)
using software to automatically extract data from the tables. We compared the results of both
extraction techniques and resolved discrepancies by referring to the original .pdf file.
Statistical re-analysis: Reproducing pre-specified analyses
We use the term "prespecified" to refer to analyses specified before or around the start of the
inclusion of the first participant which occurred on 7 February 2008 according to the clinical
study report (page 1). The prespecified analyses are generally those described in the statistical
analysis plan dated 29 May 2008.
Statistical re-analysis of primary outcome: Reproducing pre-specified
analyses
As prespecified in the original protocol, we employed an ANCOVA with the change from
baseline to day 15 ± 1 as the response variable and the baseline symptom score as the covariate.
For missing data, a last-observation-carried forward approach was employed as pre-speci-
fied in the original protocol. According to the statistical plan, a sensitivity analysis employing
only participants with complete data was also prespecified in order “to demonstrate that study
conclusions are invariant to assumptions, the particular model, and methods of handling miss-
ing data” according to the statistical analysis plan. Later statistical analysis plans describe per-
forming this sensitivity analysis on per protocol participants (who have a day 15 ± 1 symptom
scores and who took between 80% and 120% of study drugs). We present both sensitivity anal-
yses. The prespecified primary outcome analysis plans in different sources are summarized in
Table G in S1 File.
Methods for post-hoc analyses related to the handling of missing data are presented in the
supporting information section.
Secondary outcomes
We present the secondary outcome analyses from the clinical study report. According to the
clinical study report, only available data were used for some secondary outcomes but for the
following secondary outcomes missing data were imputed using the “period mean”: time loss
from household tasks, time loss from employment, number of visits and number of phone
calls to health care providers.

 Statistical re-analysis of adverse events
As prespecified we present all adverse effects that occurred between day 1 and day 15. We also
report all adverse events recorded. As prespecified, we present the results of a Pearson’s chi-
squared test to compare adverse effects between treatment groups.
Data sharing
The underlying data may be available upon request to Health Canada. Our requests under the
Access to Information Act and the Protecting Canadians from Unsafe Drugs Act (Vanessa’s
Law) to publicly post the underlying data were denied by Health Canada (see S1 Letter).[18] In
order to obtain the information, we had to sign a confidentiality agreement with Health Can-
ada that prevents us from sharing the clinical study report including the individual participant
level data.
We also requested the clinical study reports and underlying data from the European Medi-
cines Agency who responded that they had no such information to provide. We made a
request to the United States FDA but were told that we may not receive a response for several
years. We requested the individual participant level data from the trial sponsor, Duchesnay
Inc., but received no response.
Results
Fig 1 summarizes the allocations and discontinuations for the two treatment groups. Addi-
tional information about the disposition of participants in the clinical study report showed
that more participants allocated to the doxylamine-pyridoxine group were deemed to have
completed the study: 112 (80%) versus 91 (65%) for the placebo group (p = 0.007, chi-squared
7.2) (Table H in S1 File). Table 1 summarizes the baseline characteristics of participants in the
two treatment groups.
Primary outcome
Doxylamine-pyridoxine use led to a larger reduction in symptoms compared with placebo in
the prespecified imputation using last observation carried forward analysis (LOCF) but no sig-
nificant difference using the prespecified complete data sensitivity analysis (Table 2) (Figs 2
and 3). Fig 2 shows symptoms scores in each group during the trial. On the last day, the mean
symptom score in the doxylamine-pyridoxine group was 3.8 (SD = 1.4) and in the placebo
group it was 4.2 (SD = 1.2).
The results of the post-hoc analyses of different approaches to dealing with missing data are
shown in Table 2.
Secondary outcomes
Table 3 (left data column) summarizes the secondary outcome analyses. The results in the clin-
ical study report showed that there were statistically significant differences based on a p = 0.05
threshold for global well-being but not for the other ten secondary outcomes. The 2010 article
included global well-being and time lost from employment as well as two other outcomes that
were not prespecified and did not include the other prespecified secondary outcomes. The
2016 letter included some of the outcomes that were not included in the 2010 article and indi-
cated that some outcomes were not prespecified.

 Adverse effects
Table 4 summarizes the adverse events reported in the clinical study report. There were no
important differences between groups.
Most frequently reported treatment emergent adverse events are from page 6803 of clinical
study report and serious adverse events are from page 6805 of clinical study report.
According to the clinical study report, there were 4 (3.0%) serious adverse events in the
doxylamine-pyridoxine group and 5 (3.9%) in the placebo group. The same numbers are
reported on the registration website. According to the article about maternal safety [8], there
were 4 serious “treatment-emergent” adverse events in each group and separately 7 (5.3%) par-
ticipants in the doxylamine-pyrodoxine group with at least one severe adverse event and 5
(3.9%) in the placebo group with at least one severe adverse event.
We reviewed the comments provided when women were explaining their global wellbeing
score. We identified symptoms that were not recorded as adverse events although they could
have been. These include several instances of somnolence and headache. There were appar-
ently more of these events that were not reported as adverse events in the placebo group. These
are summarized in Table H in S1 File (and for clarity they are not included in Table 4 above).
We also reviewed the overall study comments and found two adverse events that were not
reported. There was one instance of dehydration resulting in an emergency department visit

 for intravenous rehydration on day 28,outside of the study period, in the doxylamine-pyridox-
ine group [page 5695 of clinical study report] that was recorded in the clinical study report as
an instance of nausea and vomiting. A miscarriage on day 8 in the placebo group [page 5716 of
clinical study report] was not recorded as an adverse event. These are summarized in Table J
in S1 File.
Discussion
Principal findings and comparison with prior reports
The prespecified analyses showed a difference between treatment groups favoring doxyla-
mine-pyridoxine that was not clinically important based on the prespecified “expected differ-
ence” or minimal clinically important difference and only statistically significant at the 0.05
alpha level using last observation carried forward imputation but not statistically significant
using the prespecified sensitivity analysis involving only participants with complete data. Our
post-hoc longitudinal analyses indicate a small treatment effect favoring doxylamine-pyridox-
ine that is neither statistically significant (at the 0.05 alpha level) nor clinically important.
In both groups, the symptom scores improve substantially over the two weeks of the trial
and plateau after day 10 (Figs 2 and 3). The difference between groups also decreases after day
10. Both of these findings could be explained by the natural history of the condition, that is, by
the resolution of symptoms irrespective of treatment. This natural resolution could account
for the lack of clinical important difference between groups.

 The clinically important difference for this trial was 3 points on the 13-point PUQE symp-
tom score based on the “expected difference” in the original protocol. The trial of ginger versus
pyridoxine for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy, that apparently was the basis for the sample
size estimate, showed substantial improvements from baseline in both groups and no statisti-
cally significant difference between the ginger and pyridoxine groups on a 10-point visual ana-
logue scale.[19] The sample size calculation for the trial of ginger versus pyridoxine was based
on a clinically significant difference between groups of 25% (and an alpha of 0.05 and a beta of
0.20) which would roughly correspond to 3 units on the 13-point scale used here (25% of
13 = 3.25).
There are three studies that provide information about the clinical significance of different
PUQE scores. A study of women calling a nausea and vomiting of pregnancy helpline catego-
rized women having mild (4–6 points), moderate (7–12 points), or severe (13–15 points)
symptoms based on the 12-hour version of the PUQE score. These categorizations were associ-
ated with discontinuation of multivitamins, healthcare costs and global wellbeing ratings.[20]
The mean PUQE score for women who visited an emergency room or who were hospitalized
(11 ± 3) was higher than for other women who called the helpline (9 ± 2.2). A similar study
involving the same recruitment method and categorizations but employing the 24-hour ver-
sion of the PUQE score found associations with the discontinuation of multivitamins and liq-
uid intake.[21] In a validation study of the Norwegian version of the PUQE score, women
hospitalized with hyperemesis gravidarum (median 13; 95% CI 11–14) had symptoms scores
higher than women attending routine antenatal appointments (median 7; 95% CI 4–8).[22]
The PUQE score was inversely correlated with nutritional intake.[22]

 In summary, the pre-specified statistical analysis plan described an “expected difference”
between doxylamine-pyridoxine and placebo of 3 points on the PUQE score whereas the larg-
est estimate of the difference is 0.73 (95% CI: 0.21 to 1.25). The expected difference of 3 points
is consistent with the clinically significant difference of 25% (3.25 on the 13-point PUQE scale)
described in the ginger vs. pyridoxine study.[20] This is also consistent with the differences in
PUQE scores associated with differences in outcomes such as emergency room visits among
groups of women in the validation studies such as emergency room visits, 2 points in one
study and 5 in another.[21, 23] Regardless of the analytical approach, the difference between

indicate difference of this magnitude in this range of the scale (mild symptoms, one point
above the minimum score) is clinically important.
The sample size calculation was apparently based on an alpha of 0.001 and an alpha of 0.05
is mentioned as the threshold for significance in the statistical analysis plan. Other values are
provided in other sources (see Table F in S1 File). It is unclear why an alpha of 0.001 was used
for the sample size calculation but an alpha of 0.05 was used to determine statistical

 significance. None of the analyses of the primary outcome indicate a p-value below 0.001 while
some but not others are below 0.05. The large sample size was similar to that employed in an
equivalence study of ginger and pyridoxine for the treatment of nausea and vomiting during
pregnancy.[23] The results of this study might even be used to exclude the possibility that dox-
ylamine-pyridoxine use provides a clinically important benefit over placebo. The large sample
size in this trial provides informative results about the limited magnitude of effectiveness of
doxylamine-pyridoxine. The maximum observed difference between drug treatment and pla-
cebo was 0.73 points (95% CI -1.25 to -0.21). The upper limit of this confidence interval, 1.25
points, suggests that a clinically important benefit is highly unlikely since 1.25 points is less
than both the criterion originally specified in this trial (3 points) or the criterion used in the
equivalence trial (2 points on a different 13-point scale).[24]
The efficacy outcomes were reported differently in the various publicly available documents
related to this clinical trial (Table 3). The published articles report the results using the last
observation carried forward imputation and not the sensitivity analyses, the global assessment
of wellbeing is reported as a primary outcome when it was prespecified as a secondary out-
come, some reported outcomes are described as secondary outcomes although they were not
prespecified and some prespecified secondary outcomes were not reported.[4, 8, 9]
Given the limited magnitude of effectiveness observed in this trial, it is worth examining
why the FDA approved doxylamine-pyridoxine following this trial. The summary of the FDA
review described the outcomes as they were prespecified and described the prespecified sensi-
tivity analyses involving the per protocol and complete data groups as showing no statistically
significant difference between doxylamine-pyridoxine and placebo for the primary efficacy
outcome.[5] The FDA statistical reviewer performed an additional sensitivity analysis (using
an unspecified statistical test) that found a statistically significant difference of 0.49 on the
PUQE scale using the per protocol group (p = 0.044) but not the complete data group (differ-
ence of 0.36, p = 0.15).[5] The trial sponsor responded to an FDA request by submitting the
results of a “mixed model repeated measures analysis” with scores at all-time points (and
apparently not just the end of study like the prespecified analysis) that found a statistically sig-
nificant difference between groups (p = 0.0002). The FDA also considered the post-hoc

 analysis of the number of participants who requested compassionate use after the study which
favored doxylamine-pyridoxine but the FDA apparently did not consider the prespecified sec-
ondary outcome of the number of tablets taken during the study where there was no difference
between groups. The only information available about the “mixed model repeated measures
analysis” is the results provided in the FDA review summary. Ultimately the FDA approved
doxylamine-pyridoxine based on this trial. The FDA statistical review concluded that there
was “some evidence that Diclegis [doxylamine-pyridoxine] was effective” and the medical
review accepted the p-value of 0.006 and the difference between groups of 0.73 from the last
carried forward imputation. The FDA summary review indicated a “small, but statistically sig-
nificant improvement” and noted that “although the treatment effect is small, there are no
other FDA-approved treatments for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy”.
Some secondary outcomes indicated a benefit of doxylamine-pyridoxine (e.g. time loss
from employment, 0.92 ± 3.86 versus 2.37 ± 10.23 days, p = 0.064) while others indicated no
difference between groups (e.g. time loss from household tasks). All PUQE subscores favored
doxylamine-pyridoxine although the difference was not statistically significant; the difference
between groups was smallest for nausea. The outcomes were reported differently in different
publications (Table 3).[4, 9]
There was no important difference between groups in adverse outcomes even when previ-
ously unreported adverse events are considered. (This 15 day trial did not provide information
about remote adverse events such as malformations which have been addressed through obser-
vational studies.)
Different information about the trial was obtained from different sources (Table 5). Trial
reporting guidelines recommend that important changes to the methods be reported with rea-
sons.[10] We were unable to discern the reasons for the differences between sources. No pro-
tocol deviations are mentioned in the 2010 report.[4] A table in the 2016 report of the trial
describes some of the prespecified secondary outcomes as “previously unreported data”.[9]
Strengths and limitations
Our re-analysis was based on several documents including the clinical study report and appen-
dices (see S1 Letter) that include the individual participant level data.
Our re-analysis employed the data submitted to regulatory bodies and was subject to all of
the limitations of the original study including the substantial lost to follow up rate and the vio-
lations of the study protocol. In addition, we may have misinterpreted some aspects of the pro-
tocol or statistical analysis plan, our data extraction method could have introduced errors that
were not detected (although several findings such as baseline characteristics were reproduced),
and our re-analysis plan was developed only after we were aware of the trials reported findings.
We were not allowed by Health Canada or the trial sponsor to make the underlying dataset
publicly available so it will be challenging for others to reproduce the analysis.
There is no perfect method for dealing with missing data.[25, 26] Last observation carried
forward imputation is known to be problematic in general because it assumes data are missing
completely at random. In this trial last observation carried forward imputation increased (or
worsened) the symptom scores in the control group relative to the active treatment group
because there was more missing data in the control arm and symptom scores decreased or
improved in both groups during the study). We employed the prespecified sensitivity analyses
including subsets of participants that disregard data from excluded participants. According to
the clinical study report the purpose of the sensitivity analysis using complete data was “to
examine the impact of missing data and data imputation, and hence to demonstrate that study
conclusions are invariant to assumptions, the particular model, and methods of handling

Conclusion
“Combination of the primary,
secondary, and exploratory
endpoints indicate clinically
significant effects with theuse of
Diclectin. The results of this
study demonstrate Diclectin
safety and efficacy in the
treatment of nausea and
vomiting of pregnancy when
administered orally.”
“Diclectin delayed release
formulation of doxylaminesuccinate
and pyridoxine hydrochloride is
effective and well tolerated in treating
nausea and vomiting of pregnancy.”
“The prespecified primary
endpoints and severalother non-
prespecified parameters support
the effectiveness of the pyridoxine-
doxylamine delayed-release
combinationover placebo.”
Statistical reviewer: “From a
statistical perspective, the data
submitted from the study DIC-301
provided some evidence that Diclegis
was effective in the treatment of
pregnant women with NVP.
However, clinical significance of such
a small treatment effect and
approvability decision is a clinical call.
Medical reviewer: “The data
presented in the application for the
single, placebo-controlled 15-day
clinicaltrial supports the approval of
Diclegis. A statistically significant
difference between Diclegis versus
placebo was demonstrated
(p = 0.006). The analysis results
confirmed atreatment improvement
of -0.73 (95% CI, -1.25, -0.22) in
pregnant women with NVP inthe
ITT-E population via LOCF.
Summary review: “. . .a new clinical
trial that shows the Diclegis
formulationprovides a small, but
statistically significant improvement
in nausea and vomiting
ofpregnancy.”

 missing data.” This prespecified approach to missing data is reasonable in certain settings and
not uncommon.[27] The prespecified sensitivity analysis showed that the findings depended
on how missing data were handled. A review of the trial by Health Canada in 2016 cited meth-
odological issues including problems with the sample size calculation, reporting of reasons for
dropouts, the last observation carried forward imputation, and the properties of the symptom
scale in concluding that “the results of the study are not definitive and consequently the inter-
pretation of the DIC-301 study is problematic.” [28]
We also employed two longitudinal models that utilize data from participants with incom-
plete measurements. These longitudinal models are not necessarily any better than the pre-
specified approach or other approaches such as multiple imputation and inverse weighting.
[24, 25, 29] The longitudinal models allow for imbalanced longitudinal data under specific
assumptions; the linear mixed model assumes data are missing at random and the linear gen-
eralized estimating equation model assumes data are missing completely at random.[30] Other
methods for handling missing data with different strengths and limitations might yield differ-
ent results. Some methods may indicate a statistically significant treatment effect while others
may not. Even if additional analyses are performed we believe that inferences regarding treat-
ment would be the same, since the difference between groups would still depend on the
“assumptions, the particular model, and methods of handling missing data” based on the dif-
ferent findings presented in Table 2.
Conclusions
This previously unpublished information about a trial of doxylamine-pyridoxine for the treat-
ment of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy calls into question the conclusion of the original
report that the medication is efficacious. For the primary outcome, none of the observed effect
sizes exceeded the prespecified clinically important difference and inferences regarding the sta-
tistical significance of the treatment at a 5% alpha level are dependent on the handling of miss-
ing data. Clinical practice and guidelines should be updated. This reanalysis underscores the
