Abstract
Objectives: To understand why mortality increased in
England and Wales in 2015.
Design: Iterative demographic analysis.
Setting: England and Wales
Participants: Population of England and Wales.
Main outcome measures: Causes and ages at death con-
tributing to life expectancy changes between 2013 and
2015.
Results: The long-term decline in age-standardised mortal-
ity in England and Wales was reversed in 2011. Although
there was a small fall in mortality rates between 2013 and
2014, in 2015 we then saw one of the largest increases in
deaths in the post-war period. Nonetheless, mortality in
2015 was higher than in any year since 2008. A small
decline in life expectancy at birth between 2013 and
2015 was not significant but declines in life expectancy at
ages over 60 were. The largest contributors to the
observed changes in life expectancy were in those aged
over 85 years, with dementias making the greatest contri-
butions in both sexes. However, changes in coding practices
and diagnosis of dementia demands caution in interpreting
this finding.
Conclusions: The long-term decline in mortality in England
and Wales has reversed, with approximately 30,000 extra
deaths compared to what would be expected if the average
age-specific death rates in 2006–2014 had continued.
These excess deaths are largely in the older population,
who are most dependent on health and social care. The
major contributor, based on reported causes of death, was
dementia but caution was advised in this interpretation.
The role of the health and social care system is explored
in an accompanying paper.

Introduction
Europe has experienced sustained reductions in mor-
tality in the post-war period, driven by improved
living conditions, lifestyles and better healthcare.
Elsewhere, developments have not always been so
favourable and, where progress is interrupted, it has
often indicated deeper societal problems. The obser-
vation that infant mortality in the Union of Soviet
Socialist Republics (USSR) was increasing in the
1980s1 was a pointer to broader problems. The
recent worsening of life expectancy in the USA is
causing concern,2 especially as worsening health indi-
cators were the strongest predictors of electoral gains
by Donald Trump.3
There are now growing concerns about the United
Kingdom. Deaths in 2015 were substantially greater
than in 2014, representing the greatest percentage
increase for almost 50 years. This increase seems to
be continuing in 2016, with the number of weekly
deaths since mid-October 2016 exceeding that in
any of the preceding three years (Web appendix).
Yet, while this has attracted attention in official cir-
cles, the explanation is far from clear. Early analyses
of the provisional data for 2015 reportedly left
experts ‘grasping for answers’.4 Delay in release of
detailed mortality data means that initial assessments
were based on incomplete data and, of necessity, pro-
posed
explanations
were
somewhat
speculative.
While some attributed the rise to influenza, suggest-
ing that cold weather may have played a part, others
asked whether it could be linked to health and social
care cuts,4 citing research linking increasing mortality
at older ages in England between 2007 and 2013 to
cuts in welfare spending.5 Public Health England
argued
that
the
deaths
were
‘not
exceptional’6
noting that the influenza strain in 2015 was influenza
A (H3N2), a strain they consider affects older people
predominantly.
It is now possible to test the explanations that have
been proposed with detailed mortality data from 2015
available for England and Wales. In this, the first of
two linked papers, we describe what happened to
mortality in 2015 and explore a range of possible
explanations. In the second paper, we look in detail
at one particular aspect of the increase in mortality in

 2015, a large increase in deaths in January of that
year, again considering possible explanations.
Methods
We adopted an iterative approach, interrogating data
to understand the nature of the phenomenon as far as
possible. We first define the scale of the problem,
assessing the magnitude of the increase in mortality
and reporting basic descriptive analyses. After stan-
dardising for age, we place what happened in 2015 in
a historical context. We then examine how mortality
varied over the course of 2015 and compare this with
what happened in previous years.
Having confirmed that mortality did rise substan-
tially in 2015, with a corresponding fall in life expect-
ancy, we then turn to life expectancy at various ages,
assessing statistical significance of changes and iden-
tifying the contributors to the decline in life expect-
ancy in terms of cause of death by sex and at different
ages. We use the Office for National Statistics (ONS)
methodology to estimate the standard errors of life
expectancy at 5-year-age increments. To identify the
contributors to observed changes, we use Arriaga’s
method of decomposition,7 which allows us to iden-
tify which causes of death, at which ages, contributed
to the changes in life expectancy, whether positively
or negatively. The initial inspection showed that the
increase in mortality was greatest among those at
older ages and from certain causes common at
those ages. Based on this, and consideration of
causes that have been invoked in earlier investiga-
tions of this phenomenon, we selected a limited
number of causes of death of interest (Table 1).
These differ from other studies using this method,
which typically focus on deaths at younger ages.
Having confirmed that deaths at older ages con-
tributed most to worsening life expectancy, we turn to
the predominant cause of death in this age group:
dementia and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We examine
trends in number of deaths and age-standardised
mortality rates (ASMR) from ONS data, along with
the potential impact of changes in coding and record-
ing of dementia and AD on death certificates.
Results
Defining the problem
The overall number of deaths in 2015, at 529,655
deaths, was 28,231 more than 2014, an increase of
5.6%.8,9 However, meaningful comparisons require
absolute numbers to be related to the population at
risk, adjusted for the age composition of the popula-
tion. Figure 1 shows that, following many years of
decline, albeit with some year-to-year fluctuations,
the downward ASMR trend does reverse after 2011
so that, by 2015, it was higher than in any year since
2008 and was 4.8% higher than in 2014 and 2.8%
higher than in 2013, reflecting the small mortality
decline between 2013 and 2014.
These figures are age-standardised using 5-year age
groups. With a rapidly ageing population, it is neces-
sary to exclude the possibility of a shift in the distri-
bution of the population within each group. To
address this issue, we have calculated the percentage
change in the death rate at individual years of age
between 2014 and 2015. As Figure 2 shows, at ages
over 75, there is an increase at each age. We also
applied age-specific death rates by single year of age
in 2014 to the mid-year population in 2015 to esti-
mate the difference from what would have been seen
had there been no change in death rates. This reveals
an excess of 33,798 deaths.
Having shown that the increase in deaths departs
from previous trends and cannot be explained by
population ageing, we next ask whether the increase
varied during the year. When deaths in each month in
2015 are compared with monthly averages for the
period 2006 to 2014 (Figure 3), the increase was in
all but three months, but with a particularly large
increase in January, when deaths were 24.2% higher
than in 2014. This increase alone accounts for an
excess of 10,479 deaths compared to what was

 expected had mean monthly deaths in 2006–2014
occurred.10 Over the entire year, the excess deaths
number 30,515. Note that calculations of excess
deaths in this paper vary slightly due to differences
in standardisation in the various comparisons.
Looking in more detail at deaths in the first
five weeks of each year (to ensure all of January
is included) since 2010, 2015 clearly stands out
(Figure 4).10 Other than in week 1, there were
many more deaths in every week of January than in
the same weeks in the previous years (dotted line
shows average for the 5-year period 2010–2014).
The accompanying paper will explore this finding in
detail.
Contribution of deaths from different causes, at different
ages, to the change in life expectancy. We now examine
in detail the deaths contributing to recent changes in
life expectancy. Although the deterioration was great-
est between 2014 and 2015, we focus on the change
between 2013 and 2015 in recognition of the slight
improvement in 2014. Figures in parentheses are
95% confidence intervals. There was a small but
non-significant deterioration in life expectancy at

(81.13–81.20). However, this includes a small increase
of 0.03 years among men, due entirely to fewer deaths
at young ages that compensated for the increase mor-
tality at older ages, and a larger decline, of 0.1 year
among women. At older ages, the declines are signifi-
cant. At age 65, life expectancy fell from 19.91
(19.88–19.93) in 2013 to 19.84 (19.82–19.86) in
2015. The corresponding figures at age 75 were

 The corresponding figures for the change between
2014 and 2015, accompanied by a commentary on
the findings, are included in a web appendix.
As expected, given the changes in life expectancy
at each age, the largest contributors to change in life
expectancy in both sexes were seen in the over 85 age
band. Notably, influenza did not significantly con-
tribute to changes in any group, although caution is
needed as coding practices can record complications
of influenza as the cause of death, such as pneumo-
nia, rather than influenza itself.
For men, continuing reductions in deaths from
diseases of the circulatory system and ‘all other
causes’ made positive contributions to improved life
expectancy in the ‘85 and over’ age band (0.04 and
0.03 years, respectively). The greatest contributors to
worsening life expectancy were dementias, with vas-
cular and unspecified dementia contributing a loss of
0.06 years, and AD a loss of 0.02 years. Pneumonia,
responsible for a loss of 0.01 years, may include some
deaths due to influenza. All age bands from 65 years
and over saw a negative contribution of vascular and

pneumonia were the third most important cause of
declining life expectancy, contributing 0.01 years,
while deaths from diseases of the circulatory system
and ‘all other causes’ made a modest positive contri-
bution to life expectancy. As with men, increasing
deaths from dementia impacted negatively from
65 years on, with modest positive contributions seen
at younger ages. These findings indicate that increas-
ing deaths in the over 75 years contributed most to
the reduction in life expectancy, with dementias the
predominant cause.

 challenges of attributing deaths at older ages to a
specific cause, it is important to ensure that the
changes observed are not a function of changes in
recording or coding. We now consider this possibility
for the dementias, noting that the initial data show an
upward acceleration in deaths attributed to both
dementia and AD, above the trend line in 2015
(Figure 7).12
Our findings must, however, be interpreted in the
context of other changes at the time. Historically, AD
and dementia have rarely been recorded as a cause of
death.13,14 The ONS codes deaths using specialist
software and highly trained coders, and in January
2014, the software package was changed.15 This
change has been associated with a 7.1% increase in
deaths coded with an underlying cause as dementia.15
In addition, financial incentives encouraging early
diagnosis of dementia in primary care were put in
place between October 2014 and March 2015. That
was associated with a marked increase in recorded

 prevalence, as seen in Figure 8.16,17 In contrast, epi-
demiological research using standardised diagnostic
criteria show a declining age-standardised prevalence
of dementia,18 although in terms of absolute num-
bers, this is counteracted by population ageing.
However, it is important to note that the overall
rise in mortality is not due to population ageing.
In summary, while the change in coding cannot
explain the increase from 2014 to 2015, the incentives
for early diagnosis may contribute in part. This
cannot explain the increase in overall deaths but
does caution against reading too much into the
apparent rise in deaths from dementia.
Discussion
The results show a rise in deaths for the whole of 2015
but also a large spike in January, of necessity exam-
ined in a separate accompanying paper. Yet, even
without it, mortality in 2015 would have increased.
The decomposition revealed that deaths among those
aged 75 and over contributed most to changes in life
expectancy, with dementias the predominant cause.
Changes in coding and diagnosis of dementia makes
the data difficult to interpret, but, even so, it is not
clear why more people would have died from demen-
tia, if the figures are taken at face value.
As noted above, attributing a specific cause of
death to older people is recognised to be challenging,
given the presence of multi-morbidity. However, the
causes of death that contribute to the increase share
the characteristic of being either a cause of frailty in
older people or a common terminal event. This pat-
tern, coupled with the earlier finding of an increase in
deaths throughout the year, suggest a general failure
of care for this group, whose members are typically
dependent on others for many aspects of their daily
life. Clearly, many live lives that are precarious, at
risk of infections, falls and fractures, so the question
is not why any particular individual died but why,
after many years of declining mortality, their death
rate should increase so much?
This study has many limitations, largely arising
from the limitations in the data available. For exam-
ple, at the time of analysis, data by single year of age
in each area were not available. Published data on the
number of deaths in England and Wales varied – if
weekly deaths are totaled, the figure is 539,007,
equating to 37,583 excess deaths compared to 2014,
and a rise of 7.5%.10 As such, even now this can only
be considered a preliminary analysis, although we
believe that we have gone as far as the data available
to us currently allow. However, this raises an import-
ant question about the priority given to monitoring
the health of the population. Almost 30,000 excess
deaths have occurred, yet, as far as we can ascertain,
this has stimulated no significant interest among
politicians. A search of Hansard reveals only one
question from a Member of Parliament (MP) about
mortality in 2015. Scottish Nationalist Party MP, Ian
Blackford, asked ‘The Minister will be aware that
mortality rates in England and Wales have increased
by 5.4% in 2015—the biggest increase in the death
rate for decades. She will also be aware that mortality
rates have been rising since 2011. Has she done any
analysis of what has been behind those trends?’ and
received the reply ‘We welcome the overall trend
towards longer life expectancy. There are annual fluc-
tuations, but overall the trend remains positive. The
key thing is helping people to live longer, healthier
lives’.19 Two further questions were asked by Dr
Sarah Wollaston following communication about
our research.
Our findings must be seen in the context of the
severe disruption to the operation of the ONS follow-
ing its move from London to Newport, with the loss
of many key staff and institutional memory, coupled
with severe cuts to its budgets – changes that have
been blamed for the downgrading of the quality of
the UK’s trade statistics.20 Given the delays and
problems we have faced, there is a strong case for
viewing the strengthening of ONS as a strategic
national priority.
The older population particularly relies on a func-
tioning health and social care system, and it has been
suggested that the increase in mortality 2015 could be
related to austerity and the resulting health and social
care cuts.4,21 There is already evidence linking auster-
ity and increasing suicide rates22 and dependence on
food banks.23 One study has examined in detail
changes in life expectancy in England in the years
2007 to 2013,5 finding a close correlation with cuts
in pension credits at the level of local authorities.
These funds provide an important source of income
for the poorest pensioners. Although these findings
predate the current increase in mortality, they offer a
possible clue.
For those working in health and social care, the
impact of austerity is already clear, with one survey
of general practitioners finding that 94% of respond-
ents reported that their workload had increased as a
direct result of the financial hardship of their
patients.24 Recent reports from the British Medical
Association (BMA)25 and the Royal College of
Physicians26
have
both
highlighted
the
serious
public health consequences of austerity and the
underfunding of the NHS, with the BMA calling
for ‘robust action’ to mitigate the adverse impacts.
It is not possible, with the limited data currently
available, to explore this hypothesis in more detail,
160

 at least as it relates to deaths throughout the year, but
some further clues can be found in the second part of
our analysis, of the January 2015 spike in mortality.
In addition, cuts to local authorities’ budgets have
resulted in the withdrawal of many services that older
people depend on. Rural bus routes have been
reduced dramatically, increasing isolation of those
dependent on them.27,28 Meals on wheels services
have been stopped in a third of top tier councils,
with the National Association of Care Catering
(NACC) drawing attention to the consequences,
noting how a daily visit can reduce loneliness and
isolation, prevent admission to hospital by support-
ing independent living and reducing medical prob-
lems resulting from malnutrition.29 Given these
circumstances, it is unsurprising that, in 2014–2015,
29.2% of those 80 years and above reported high
levels of loneliness.30
Conclusion
Approximately 30,000 more people died in 2015
than 2014 in England and Wales, with the increase
in year on year deaths the greatest since World War
II. Decomposition methods showed that the deaths
in those over 75 years contributed most to changes
in life expectancy, with dementias the predominant
cause recorded. Changes in diagnosis and coding of
dementia likely had an impact on these figures, and
as such this should be interpreted with caution.
What is clear is that the older population, who
rely heavily on a well-functioning health and social
care system, were the most harmed by the mortality
increase.
With no satisfactory explanation provided for this
increase so far, the accompanying paper in this series
will aim to explore possible causes for such a rise in
mortality, along with closer consideration of the
impact of the cuts to the health and social care
system.
