OBJECTIVES: Noncigarette tobacco products may confer a risk of marijuana use similar to 
combustible cigarettes. We examined whether adolescent electronic cigarette (e-cigarette), 
hookah, or combustible cigarette use is associated with initiating and currently using 
marijuana as well as using both tobacco and marijuana concurrently.
METHODS: Adolescents from 10 public schools in Los Angeles, California, completed 
in-classroom surveys at baseline (fall 2013, ninth grade) and at a 24-month follow-up  
(fall 2015, 11th grade). Among adolescents who never used marijuana at baseline  
(N = 2668), associations of baseline e-cigarette, hookah, or combustible cigarette use with 
ever marijuana use (initiation), current marijuana use (past 30 days), and current dual use 
of marijuana and these tobacco products at the 24-month follow-up were examined.
RESULTS: Baseline ever versus never e-cigarette use was associated with initiation (odds ratio 
[OR] 3.63; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.69–4.90) and current (OR 3.67; 95% CI 2.51–5.36) 
marijuana use 24 months later. Ever versus never hookah use was associated with initiation 
(OR 3.55; 95% CI 2.49–5.08) and current (OR 4.10; 95% CI 2.69–6.25) marijuana use 24 
months later. Similar associations were observed for combustible cigarette smoking and 
initiation (OR 4.30; 95% CI 2.79–6.63) and current use of marijuana (OR 1.97; 95% CI 1.05–
3.68). Current use of any of these tobacco products at baseline was associated with current 
use of both tobacco and marijuana (OR 2.28; 95% CI 1.47–3.55) 24 months later.
CONCLUSIONS: The association between tobacco use and subsequent marijuana use across 
adolescence extends to multiple tobacco products.

 Combustible cigarette smoking 
is associated with the initiation 
of marijuana use, earlier onset of 
marijuana use, more rapid escalation 
in use, and the development of 
nicotine and cannabis dependence.1 
– 
4 
The adverse health consequences 
of cigarette smoking and marijuana 
use have been documented, 
5, 
 
6 with 
more severe and persistent negative 
outcomes seen when use is initiated 
during adolescence and when both 
substances are used.1, 
 
7, 
 
8
Although adolescent cigarette 
smoking has declined significantly 
over the past decade, 
9 approximately 
one-third of US adolescents report 
currently using at least 1 tobacco 
product, an increase of 35% since 
2011.9 This increase is attributable 
to the use of alternative nicotine-
delivery products, such as electronic 
cigarettes (e-cigarettes) and 
hookah.10, 
 
11 More than 11% of 
high school students currently use 
e-cigarettes, 
12 and an estimated 5% 
to 11% currently smoke hookah.12

Whether the well-established 
comorbidity between combustible 
cigarette smoking and subsequent 
marijuana use in adolescence 
translates to e-cigarette and hookah 
use is unknown.
Data revealing that the use of 
e-cigarettes and hookah are 
associated with risk of adolescent 
marijuana use and co-use would 
be important evidence for guiding 
marijuana and tobacco policies to 
protect adolescent health.10, 
 
16 The 
diversity of marijuana products, 
such as vaporized and edible 
forms, offers more opportunities 
for co-use. In addition, if use of 
e-cigarettes and hookah increases 
the likelihood of marijuana use, 
the health risks of increased youth 
marijuana use should be included in 
models of the net population effects 
of alternative tobacco products.17 
We examined whether adolescent 
use of e-cigarettes and hookah is 
associated with the risk of initiating 
and regularly using marijuana as well 
as using both substances among  
high school students from ages 14  
to 16 years.
METHODS
Participants and Procedure
Data were collected as part of a 
longitudinal survey of substance use 
and mental health among high school 
students in Los Angeles, California. 
Approximately 40 public high schools 
in the Los Angeles metropolitan area 
were approached about participating 
in this study; these schools were 
chosen because of their diverse 
demographic characteristics and 
proximity. Ten schools agreed to 
participate in the study. To enroll in 
the study, students and their parents 
were required to provide active 
written or verbal assent and consent, 
respectively. Data collection involved 
5 assessment waves that took place 
∼6 months apart: baseline (fall 2013, 
ninth grade), 6-month follow-up 
(spring 2014, ninth grade), 12-month 
follow-up (fall 2014, 10th grade), 
18-month follow-up (spring 2015, 
10th grade), and 24-month follow-up 
(fall 2015, 11th Grade). Waves 1 and 
5 are the focus of this investigation 
because current use of all forms of 
marijuana was assessed at wave 5. At 
each wave, paper-and-pencil surveys 
were administered in students’ 
classrooms. Students who were 
absent completed an interviewer-
administered phone survey or a 
Web-based survey. The University 
of Southern California Institutional 
Review Board approved the study.
Measures
Each measure described below 
has been shown to have adequate 
psychometric properties in 
adolescent samples.9,

Tobacco Product Use and Marijuana 
Use
At baseline and the 24-month 
follow-up, items based on the Youth 
Risk Behavior Surveillance Survey9, 
 
18  
were used to assess ever use and 
current use (past 30-day use; yes 
or no) of e-cigarettes, combustible 
cigarettes, and a hookah water pipe; 
use of any type of marijuana product 
at baseline; and use of 3 different 
marijuana products (combustible, 
vaped, and edible) at follow-up. 
Responses to the baseline questions 
of ever tobacco use (combustible 
cigarette, e-cigarette, and hookah) 
served as the primary exposure 
variable. Outcomes were ever 
use (yes or no) and current use 
(past 30-day use; yes or no) of (1) 
combustible marijuana, (2) vaped 
marijuana, and (3) edible marijuana. 
The terms “ever-marijuana users” 
and “never-marijuana user” are 
used to refer to adolescents who 
ever and never used any of the 3 
forms of marijuana, respectively. 
The relationship between other 
tobacco products (eg, smokeless 
tobacco and cigars) and marijuana 
were not examined because of a low 
prevalence of use and because we 
were interested in evaluating novel 
associations between newer tobacco 
products and marijuana.
Covariates
Variables that potentially overlapped 
with the risk for tobacco use and the 
risk of marijuana use were selected 
a priori as covariates on the basis 
of previous studies.20 
– 
26 Covariates 
included sociodemographic, 
environmental, and interpersonal 
variables.
Sociodemographics
Sociodemographic characteristics, 
including age, sex, ethnicity, race, 
and highest parental education, were 
assessed by using self-report items.
Environmental Factors
Indicators of the proximal 
environment included family living 
situation, which was measured with 
the item, “Who do you live with most 
of the time?” (both biological parents 
versus other).22 Family history of 
smoking was measured by using 
AUDRAIN-MCGOVERN et al

Downloaded from 
 the question, “Does anyone in your 
immediate family (brothers, sisters, 
parents, and/or grandparents) have 
a history of smoking cigarettes?” 
(yes or no). Peer smoking was 
assessed with responses to the item, 
“In the last 30 days, how many of 
your 5 closest friends have smoked 
cigarettes?” (range: 0–5).9 Similar 
questions were used to measure 
family history of substance and peer 
marijuana use.
Intrapersonal Factors
Affective and self-regulatory 
psychological processes linked 
with tobacco use, marijuana use, 
and other risky behaviors were 
assessed. Depressive symptoms 
were measured by using the 
20-item Center for Epidemiologic 
Studies Depression Scale (CESD)19 
composite sum past-week frequency 
rating (eg, 0 = rarely or none of the 
time [0–1 day] to 3 = most or all of 
the time [5–7 days]). Impulsivity 
was measured with the 5-item 
Temperament and Character 
Inventory (TCI) Impulsivity subscale 
sum score, which is used to assess 
tendency toward acting on instinct 
without conscious deliberation (eg, “I 
often do things based on how I feel at 
the moment”; range: 0–5).20
Statistical Analysis
Multinomial polytomous regression 
models were used to test the 
association between baseline 
tobacco product use and marijuana 
product use 24 months later across 
3 outcome categories: (0) never use, 
(1) past use (ie, initiated or ever use 
but no use in the past 30 days), and 
(2) current use (ie, use in the past 
30 days). Adolescents who reported 
no marijuana use at baseline formed 
the sample for analyses. Odds ratios 
(ORs) and 95% confidence intervals 
(CIs) were calculated to estimate 
the risk of past or current use of 
each marijuana product in relation 
to never use. Separate unadjusted 
models were used for each predictor 
(combustible cigarettes, e-cigarettes, 
hookah, and any of these products). 
School-level clustering was recoded 
to the district level and entered as 
a fixed effect because of the low 
prevalence of current marijuana 
vaping at 1 of the participating 
schools. Variables listed in Table 
1, including sociodemographic, 
environmental, and interpersonal 
factors that are linked to adolescent 
tobacco and marijuana use, were 
added in subsequent separate 
adjusted models as potential 
confounders.
To assess the unique effects of each 
individual tobacco product, a set of 
combined polytomous regression 
models were run, in which lifetime 
use of e-cigarettes, hookah, and 
combustible cigarettes were included 
as simultaneous predictors to 
elucidate the incremental effect of 
each product after controlling for 
their covariance with one another. 
Missing data on covariates were 
handled by using multiple imputation 
with the Markov Chain Monte Carlo 
method of data augmentation.27 
– 
29 
Continuous variables were rescaled 
(mean = 0; SD = 1) for regression 
models to facilitate interpretation. 
Analyses were conducted by using 
IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows 
version 24.0 (IBM SPSS Statistics, 
IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY). 
Significance was set to .05, and all 
tests were 2 tailed.
RESULTS
Study Sample
All ninth-grade English-speaking 
students who were not in special 
education (eg, because of severe 
learning disabilities) were eligible 
to participate (N = 4100). Of the 
assenting students (N = 3874; 
94.5%), 3396 (87.7%) provided 
parental consent, from whom data 
were collected for 3383 (99.6%) 
at baseline and 3232 (95.2%) 24 
months later. The sample was limited 
to those adolescents who provided 
data on lifetime tobacco product use, 
lifetime marijuana use, marijuana 
product use at follow-up, and those

 who had never used marijuana at 
baseline (N = 2668). The sample 
characteristics are summarized 
in Table 1. There were positive 
associations between ever use of the 
tobacco products at baseline and all 
environmental and interpersonal 
characteristics (Table 1).
Descriptive Analyses
Baseline never-marijuana users  
with (N = 2668) versus without  
(N = 149) follow-up data did not differ 
in ever use of tobacco (e-cigarettes, 
hookah, and combustible cigarettes) 
at baseline or sociodemographic, 
environmental, or interpersonal 
characteristics except for being 
composed of more boys than girls  
(P = .02) and living without versus 
with both biological parents (P = .03).
Associations Between Baseline 
Tobacco Ever Use and Marijuana 
Use at Follow-up in Baseline Never-
Marijuana Users
Among never-marijuana users 
at baseline, 231 (8.7%) reported 
current use of at least 1 marijuana 
product at the 24-month follow-up, 
whereas 490 (18.4%) reported 
having used at least 1 product in the 
past 24 months leading up to the 
follow-up (Table 2).
 
Table 3 shows the results of models 
that were unadjusted and adjusted 
for covariates. Here, we summarize 
the results of the adjusted models. 
Among baseline never-marijuana 
users, baseline ever (versus never) 
use of e-cigarettes was associated 
with the initiation of marijuana use 
(39.6% vs 15.7%; OR 3.63; 95% CI 
2.69–4.90) and current marijuana 
use (19.5% vs 7.3%; OR 3.67; 95% 
CI 2.51–5.36) at the 24-month 
follow-up. Baseline ever (versus 
never) use of hookah was associated 
with the initiation of marijuana use 
(38.5% vs 16.7%; OR 3.55; 95% 
CI 2.49–5.08) and current use of 
any marijuana (23.9% vs 7.4%; 
OR 4.10; 95% CI 2.69–6.25) at the 
24-month follow-up. Baseline ever

 (versus never) combustible cigarette 
smoking was associated with the 
initiation of marijuana use (49.6% vs 
16.9%; OR 4.30; 95% CI 2.79–6.63) 
and current marijuana use (13.4% vs 
8.4%; OR 1.97; 95% CI 1.05–3.68) at 
the 24-month follow-up.
We evaluated the associations 
between use of 1 of the 3 tobacco 
products at baseline (e-cigarettes, 
hookah, and combustible cigarettes) 
and use of the 3 different forms of 
marijuana (combustible marijuana, 
vaping marijuana, and marijuana 
edibles) 24 months later. Baseline 
ever (versus never) e-cigarette use 
or hookah use was associated with 
initiating and currently using all 
3 forms of marijuana (all P <.05). 
These same relationships were 
observed for baseline combustible 
cigarette use with the exception of 
current (but not ever) marijuana 
vaping and marijuana edible 
consumption outcomes at follow-up. 
Moreover, ever use of any of these 
3 tobacco products at baseline was 
prospectively associated with the 
initiation of marijuana use (38.5% vs 
13.9%; OR 4.00; 95% CI 3.12–5.14) 
and current marijuana use at the 
24-month follow-up (19.6% vs 6.3%; 
OR 4.21; 95% CI 3.05–5.81). For each 
additional tobacco product used at 
baseline, adolescents had 3.5 times–
greater odds of initiating marijuana 
use in the last 24 months (95% CI 
2.93–4.19) and 3.4 times–greater 
odds of currently using marijuana 
(95% CI 2.76–4.26).
The associations between tobacco 
and marijuana remained significant 
in both the unadjusted and adjusted 
models across all individual tobacco 
and marijuana products (Table 3). 
In combined polytomous regression 
models that we used to test the 
effect of ever use of combustible 
cigarettes, e-cigarettes, and hookah 
as simultaneous predictors, each 
individual tobacco product use 
retained significant effects on past 
(versus never) marijuana product use 
even after covariate adjustment. In

were observed for e-cigarettes and 
hookah on current (versus never) 
marijuana product use, whereas 
combustible cigarettes did not.
Associations Between Baseline 
Ever- Tobacco Use and Dual Use of 
Tobacco and Marijuana at Follow-up
In the sample of never-marijuana 
users, adolescents who currently 
(versus never) used 1 of the 3 
tobacco products (either e-cigarettes, 
hookah, or combustible cigarettes) at 
baseline were more likely to report 
current use of 1 of these tobacco 
products 24 months later (9.0% vs 
3.6%; OR 2.38; 95% CI 1.58–3.58), 
current use of a marijuana product 
24 months later (11.7% vs 3.3%; 
OR 3.23; 95% CI 2.18–4.79), and 
current dual use of 1 of these tobacco 
products and marijuana (7.9% vs 
3.0%; OR 2.28; 95% CI 1.47–3.55; 
 
Table 4).
DISCUSSION
In the current study, we offer 
new evidence for a prospective 
relationship between adolescent 
e-cigarette and hookah use and the 
risk of initiating and currently using 
marijuana. E-cigarette and hookah 
use at age 14 years was associated 
with a 3.6- to fourfold increase in the 
odds of initiating and currently using 
marijuana 2 years later. Similar to 
combustible cigarette smoking, the 
use of e-cigarettes or hookah in early 
adolescence more than doubled the 
odds of currently using both tobacco 
and marijuana by midadolescence.
These findings suggest that newer 
forms of tobacco likely increase 
adolescent vulnerability to marijuana 
use and dual use of marijuana and 
tobacco even in the context of other 
factors that are also correlated with 
marijuana use. Associations between 
the use of these tobacco products 
with subsequent marijuana use 
could reflect shared genetic liability 
to use both tobacco and marijuana 
as well as environmental features 
that make co-use more likely.1 
An environment characterized by 
peer use, easier access, and shared 
perceptions of reduced risk increase 
the likelihood that e-cigarettes, 
hookah, and (ultimately) marijuana 
will be used.30 
– 
32 Even after adjusting 
for many of these shared risk factors 
for tobacco and marijuana use, the 
models remained robust, which 
increases our confidence that the 
observed associations were not 
attributable to another variable.
Indeed, the use of e-cigarettes and 
hookah may foster adolescent 
marijuana use. Nicotine primes the 
brain’s reward system by enhancing 
the level of pleasure experienced 
from subsequent drug exposures, 
such as to marijuana.33 Adolescents 
who initiate marijuana with (versus 
without) previous nicotine exposure 
may experience more pleasure from 
their initial marijuana use experience 
and progress more rapidly to regular 
marijuana use.4, 
 
33 Research reveals 
that a bout of hookah smoking can 
yield 1.7 times more nicotine than 
that of a combustible cigarette.34 
As such, it is not surprising that the 
association between hookah smoking 
and subsequent use of all forms of 
marijuana use are the strongest. We 
did not measure whether adolescents 
had used electronic liquid (e-liquid) 
without nicotine or tobacco-free 
(herbal) forms of hookah at baseline, 
and therefore, we cannot confirm the 
role of nicotine in the current results. 
Yet, 63% of current adolescent 
e-cigarette users at follow-up 
reported using e-liquid with nicotine, 
and teenagers who report using 
e-liquids without nicotine may also 
be inadvertently exposed because 
nicotine has been detected in >90% 
of e-liquids sampled, including those 
that are labeled as nicotine free.35, 
 
36
Additionally, airway adaptations 
that occur as part of hookah smoking 
and e-cigarette vaping may facilitate 
marijuana smoking and vaping by 
reducing sensitivity to the irritation 
caused by the inhalation of marijuana 
products. Repeated inhalation of 
hot hookah smoke and habituation 
to the “throat hit” associated with 
propylene glycol in e-liquid may 
render the transition to smoking 
or vaping marijuana more pleasant 
and thus likely to be repeated. It is 
important to point out that hookah 
is the only tobacco product of the 
3 studied that is characterized by 
flavor and combustion. Perhaps these 
combined features, in addition to a 
shared form of administration (eg, 
water pipe), foster the use of both 
hookah and marijuana.
The associations between e-cigarette 
and hookah use and subsequent 
marijuana use are stronger than 
those for combustible cigarettes. 
E-cigarette and hookah use is more 
prevalent than combustible cigarette 
smoking among adolescents, yet 
e-cigarettes and hookah are far less 
regulated.10,

Likewise, access does not currently 
appear to be a significant barrier to 
use. For example, of the adolescents 
who reported smoking hookah, 
27% smoked it at a friend’s house, 
8% smoked at a hookah bar or café, 
8% smoked at home, 6% smoked 
somewhere else, 8% smoked at 
multiple locations, and 43% chose 
not to indicate where they smoke 
hookah. Recent trends in marijuana 
policy across numerous states in the 
United States are moving toward 
increasing legalization; such trends 
have been associated with a higher 
prevalence of use of both marijuana 
and tobacco.31, 
 
39 With the data from 
the current study, we raise questions 
regarding the impact of less 
restrictive policies on the use and 
co-use of newer tobacco products 
and marijuana in the adolescent 
population. These data are used to 
support strict policies to prevent 
tobacco product and marijuana 
product sales to minors. Hookah 
smoking has many of the same 
health risks as combustible cigarette 
smoking.40 Although some e-cigarette 
advocates may not be alarmed by 
youth trying e-cigarettes, concerns 
should be heightened by the finding 
that e-cigarette use is associated with 
marijuana use as well as dual use.
Dual use of tobacco and marijuana 
is particularly troubling because 
it increases the likelihood of an 
adolescent becoming dependent 
on both nicotine and cannabis.1, 
 
41 
Adolescents are likely to continue 
to use both because of greater 
withdrawal symptoms and declines 
in cognitive functioning during 
abstinence than adolescents 
who only use tobacco.42 As such, 
interventions and regulations to 
prevent adolescent e-cigarette, 
hookah, and marijuana use are 
critical.
The study has several strengths, 
including having a demographically 
diverse sample that was measured 
during a developmentally vulnerable 
period for substance use, using 
repeated measures of tobacco and 
marijuana initiation and current use, 
excluding adolescents who had ever 
used marijuana at baseline to clarify 
temporal precedence, and having 
high participation and retention 
rates.
A limitation of this study is that the 
frequency of marijuana use was 
not measured, only use in the past 
30 days. As such, we are not able 
to determine whether e-cigarette 
or hookah use is associated with 
a specific level of marijuana use 
beyond current use. Likewise, 
specific characteristics of e-cigarettes 
and hookah (eg, flavoring) were 
not assessed; thus, the role of these 
characteristics in marijuana uptake 
cannot be determined.
The sample was drawn from a 
specific location, which may lessen 
generalizability. However, given 
that California has decriminalized 
marijuana for recreational use, 
the present sample may offer a 
snapshot of the likely associations 
between novel tobacco products 
and marijuana use in a state where 
tobacco regulations are more 
restrictive and marijuana use is more 
normalized. It is important to note 
that the prevalence of e-cigarette and 
hookah use in the current study are 
comparable to those rates identified 
in national studies.43 Lastly, this 
is an observational study and the 
first to examine these associations. 
Inferences regarding whether the 
identified associations are causal 
cannot be made but should be 
the subject of future research. It 
will also be valuable to identify 
mechanisms that drive marijuana use 
among adolescents who have used 
e-cigarettes and hookah.
CONCLUSIONS
Adolescents who used e-cigarettes 
or hookah at baseline compared with 
those who did not were more likely 
to report initiation and current use 
of marijuana as well as dual use of 
tobacco and marijuana. The association 
between tobacco use and subsequent 
marijuana use across adolescence 
extends to multiple tobacco products.
