Abstract: Background 
Rare cancers here defined as those with an annual incidence rate less 
than 6/100,000 in Europe, 
 pose challenges for diagnosis, treatments, and clinical decision-making. 
Information on rare cancers is scant. We updated the estimates of the 
burden of rare cancers in Europe, their time trends in incidence and 
survival, and provide information on centralization of treatments in 
seven European countries. 
Methods 
We analysed data on more than two million rare cancer diagnoses, provided 
by 83 cancer registries, to estimate European incidence and survival in 
2000-2007 and the corresponding time trends during 1995-2007.  Incidence 
rates were calculated as the number of new cases divided by the 
corresponding total person years in the population. Five-year relative 
survival (RS) was calculated by the Ederer-2 method. Seven registries 
(Belgium, Bulgaria, Finland, Ireland, Netherlands, Slovenia, and the 
Navarra region in Spain) provided additional data on hospitals of 
treatment for about 220,000 cases diagnosed in 2000-2007. Hospital volume 
was calculated as the number of treatments provided by each hospital rare 
cancer group sharing the same referral pattern.  
Findings 
Rare cancers accounted for 24% of all cancers diagnosed in EU28 during 
2000-2007. The overall incidence rose yearly by 2.3%. RS  increased 
(overall 5.7%), from 1999-2001 to 2007-2009, and for the majority of rare 
cancers, with the largest increases for hematological tumors and 
sarcomas. The level of centralization of rare cancer treatment varied 
 widely between cancers and between countries. The Netherlands and 
Slovenia had the highest treatment volumes. 
Interpretation 
The study profits from the largest pool of population-based registries to 
estimate incidence and survival of about 200 rare cancers. Incidence 
trends can be explained by changes in known risk factors, improved 
diagnosis, and registration problems. Survival could be improved by early 
diagnosis, new treatments and better case management. There is ample room 
for improving the centralization of treatment in these seven European 
countries. 
The research was funded by the European Commission (Chafea) [Grant No. 
2000111201].

Introduction 
The RARECARE project defined rare cancers as those with an annual incidence rate less than 
6/100,000 in Europe (EU), and showed that about one in five were rare types and slightly more 
than four million rare cancers were prevalent in the EU population [1]. Because of their low 
numbers, the almost 200 rare cancers listed by RARECARE pose challenges for diagnosis, 
treatments, and clinical decision-making. Clinical trials are rare too, and it is hard to build up new 
knowledge and expertise.  
There is a broad consensus that the diagnostic pathologic confirmation and primary treatment of 
rare cancers, in particular, should be centralized in reference centers and/or in collaborative 
networks, with multidisciplinary approaches [2] and very specific expertise. In addition, clinical 
and translational research calls for a high level of centralization and international collaboration. To 
what extent appropriate policies for rare cancer patients are implemented at the country level has 
 7 
 
seldom been studied.  As a consequence, information for policy makers and stakeholders is 
scarce for many of these tumors. 
The project Information Network on Rare Cancers (RARECAREnet) is designed to update 
epidemiological information on rare cancers in the EU [3], to provide indicators at the country 
level, time trends, and to study to what extent treatment is centralized in Europe.  
This paper provides up-to-date incidence and survival estimates based on data collected from 94 
population-based cancer registries (CRs), for 198 rare cancers diagnosed in 2000-2007 and for 
12 major families of rare cancers. It also presents data on the levels of centralization for rare 
cancers in selected European countries.  
Material and Methods 
Patients 
The data were extracted from two databases. The first, the descriptive analysis database, is a 
subset of the EUROCARE-5 database [4]. It includes incidence and follow-up data provided by 
European population-based CRs regarding cancer patients diagnosed in the period Jan 1,1978 to 
Dec 31, 2007. Vital status was updated to Dec 31,  2008. From the 117 CRs participating in 
EUROCARE-5, we excluded specialized pediatric CRs, the Swedish and Turin CRs, because 
they did not participate in the RARECAREnet study, and the Danish CR, because it provided 
none of the details on morphology needed to define rare cancers. Details of the RARECAREnet 
database can be found in the report on the project website [5]. For the analysis of incidence we 
excluded 11 CRs specialized in specific anatomical sites to avoid incomplete coverage of some 
cancer entities affecting multiple sites such as neuroendocrine tumors. A total of 1,984,147 rare 
cancer diagnoses were considered for incidence estimates in 2000-2007, collected by 83 CRs 
from 1,566 million person-years of observation. Data for incidence trends came from 42 CRs 
covering the period 1995-2007, and included 2,268,602 cases, and 1,900 million person-years of 
observation. Survival estimates in 2000-2007 for all the rare cancers were based on a total of 
 8 
 
1,994,346 diagnoses, observed by 94 CRs. Case identified only with death certificate (DCO) or 
casually discovered at autopsy were excluded from the analysis because they do not report time 
of survival. Cases lost to follow-up were considered as censored at the date of last contact.  
Multiple primaries in a same patient were included. Death certificate only (DCO) and autopsy 
cases were excluded but data included multiple primaries in a single patient. Finally, survival 
trend analysis was based on 1,649,309 rare cancer diagnoses from 45 CRs providing 
uninterrupted data from at least Jan 1, 1995 to Dec 31, 2007.  
The second database was used for the study of hospitals of treatment and hospital volume. It 
comes from seven European CRs: the national CRs of Belgium, Bulgaria, Finland, Ireland, 
Netherlands, Slovenia, and the regional CR of Navarra (Spain). This last, although regional, was 
added in consideration of the regional organization of the Spanish health care system. These 
CRs were selected to reflect the variability of incidence and survival in Europe [1,5], and because 
they could provide detailed data for all 198 rare cancers. Variables included: sex, dates of birth 
and diagnosis, topography and morphology codes, from the International Classification of 
Disease for Oncology version 3 (ICDO-3) grading, pathological and clinical TNM, simplified stage 
(localized, regional extension, metastatic), treatment (surgery, radiotherapy, systemic, other or 
none), vital status, date of closure of follow-up or death, hospital of diagnosis and hospital of 
treatment.  DCO and autopsy cases (1.3% overall, with a maximum of 8.6% in Bulgaria) were not 
included. The hospital of diagnosis was defined as the hospital where the pathology examination 
was done or requested. The hospital of treatment(s) was defined as the hospital where a specific 
treatment (e.g. surgery) or the first course of systemic therapy (e.g. chemotherapy) was given. Up 
to five different types of treatment within one year from the date of diagnosis were considered as 
a primary treatment. Vital status was further updated, with respect to the descriptive analysis 
database, to Dec 31, 2012. 
 9 
 
We received data on about 348,000 rare cancers diagnosed in the period 2000-2007. However, 
national data from Belgium were limited to the period of diagnosis 2004-2007, and those from 
Navarra to 2000-2005. Cases diagnosed in Bulgaria and the Netherlands during 2000-2004 were 
removed on account of incomplete national coverage of hospital information. A total of 223,081 
rare cancer cases were included in the hospital volume study database. Unspecific morphologies 
(8000, 8001, 8010, 8800, 9800, 9590) were found in 2.1% of cases, with the highest proportion 
(4.1%) in Finland. Seventeen per cent of cases (37,959/223,081) was removed, because for them 
the information of hospital was missing. 
Methods 
Rationale of the definition of rare cancer entities and their classification in terms of ICD-O codes 
are reported elsewhere [1,2,5]. Classification was structured in way to avoid any overlapping 
among rare entities. For example, GEP NET and GIST tumours were under the families of NET 
and sarcomas, and not also in digestive rare cancers. 
Incidence rates were estimated as the number of new cases arising in 2000-2007 divided by the 
corresponding total person years (male + female) in the general population. The European 
standard population was used for direct age standardization. New cases in 2013 in EU28 were 
calculated by multiplying age- and sex-specific incidence rates in 2000-2007 by the 
corresponding European population classified in five-year age classes on 1 January 2013. 
Incidence variation over time was estimated restricting the analysis to 1,480,424 cases diagnosed 
in the two sub-periods 1999-2002 and 2003-07, and was presented in a funnel plot where each 
dot represents a single rare cancer, the y-axis displays the estimated difference in terms of 
annual percent change (APC) of age-adjusted incidence, and the x-axis the corresponding 
precision in terms of the inverse of its standard error. APC was calculated as the ratio between 
incidence rates for the two sub-periods elevated to 1/4.5, the inverse of their mean time distance. 
Three-standard-deviation confidence intervals for estimated zero changes [6] are represented by 
 10 
 
two symmetrical lines progressively approaching the x-axis with increasing x values. Dots lying 
above or below the area between them correspond respectively to tumors with 99.8% significantly 
higher or lower incidence rates. 
Five-year relative survival (RS) was estimated as the ratio of observed to expected survival in the 
general population, matched by age, sex, calendar year, and geographical area, and calculated 
by the Ederer-2 method [7].  RS time trends were estimated by the period approach considering 
three follow-up periods: 1999-2001 (cohorts diagnosed in Jan 1,1995 to Dec 31, 2001), 2002-04 
(cohorts diagnosed in Jan 1,1998 to Dec 31, 2004), and 2005-07 (cohorts diagnosed in Jan 1, 
2001 to Dec 31, 2007). RS changes were presented as a funnel plot, similarly to incidence 
changes, but using the difference between five-year RS in the last and first of these periods on 
the y-axis. 
The volume (number) of treatments provided by each hospital was calculated for major cancer 
groups, defined by aggregating all the solid rare cancers into 38 groups sharing the same referral 
pattern (see Figure 3). For example, all the 17 head and neck tumors, identified [1] as clinically 
distinct rare entities, are usually referred to head and neck specialized services, and were 
considered as a single group. Hematological rare tumors, not always requiring hospitalization, 
were not considered in the volume analysis.  Hospital volume for each of the 38 groups was then 
computed as the annual number of any treatment delivered by the hospital, for all the cancers in 
that group. Repeated admissions to the same hospital for the same cancer and the same 
treatment type (i.e. surgery, radiotherapy or systemic therapy) were considered as a single 
admission and counted as one treatment in the analyses. Instead, repeated admissions for 
several treatment types (such as radiotherapy and subsequent surgery) given to a patient in the 
same hospital were all counted as treatments. Untreated patients were assigned to the hospital of 
diagnosis. The total number of treatments provided by each hospital for a given group of rare 
 11 
 
cancers was then divided by the number of years of observation to provide its mean annual 
hospital volume.  
Finally, for each patient we calculated the mean annual volume of the hospital(s) where they were 
treated, so obtaining a patient-specific measure with a much less skewed distribution with respect 
to the hospital-specific volume. Averaging this measure over all the patients diagnosed with a 
given group of rare cancers in a certain country gives a cancer- and country-specific measure of 
the level of expertise that patients can expect for the treatment of their tumor. We called it the 
mean admission volume (MAV) indicator.

Results 
Burden of rare cancers in Europe 
Table 1 provides incidence and survival estimates for each of the 198 rare cancers, for 63 groups 
of rare cancers (capital letters), for the 12 wider families in which rare cancers are hierarchically 
grouped, and for six common cancer groups.  Hematological malignancies, rare cancers of 
female genital organs and of the digestive tract, and head and neck cancers were families with 
the highest overall incidence rates (from 15 to 28/100,000/year). Thoracic cancers, male genital 
and urological, endocrine organs, central nervous system (CNS) tumors and sarcomas had 
overall incidence rates from 5 to 8/100,000. Rare skin cancers and non-cutaneous melanoma, 
and embryonal cancers were the families with the lowest rates (1.22 and 0.34 per 100,000). 
Overall, rare cancers accounted for 24% of all cancers diagnosed in EU28 during 2000-2007; by 
far the majority were solid cancers (76%). For sex-specific rare cancers, we also provide in 
supplementary table (see appendix p 1) sex specific incidence rates. 
 12 
 
Five-year RS of all rare cancers together was 49%, compared to 63% for all common cancers.  
Rare cancers also had lower survival within the families of digestive cancers (15% vs. 41%), 
female genital cancers (58% vs. 82%), male genital and urologic cancers (74% vs. 76%), skin 
cancers (70% vs. 96%) and hematological tumors (51% vs. 61%). The only exception was the 
group of thoracic cancers (13% vs. 10%), where common cancers included squamous cell 
carcinoma of the lung - with a very bad prognosis (6% after five years).  Families including only 
rare cancers had five-year RS ranging from high, as for embryonal and endocrine organ tumors 
(79% and 88%), to intermediate, for sarcomas (60%), neuroendocrine (54%) and head & neck 
tumors (52%), and low for CNS tumors (21%).  
Time trends of incidence and survival for rare cancers are shown in Figures 1 and 2. Cancers 
whose incidence variation fell outside the confidence interval shown in Figure 1 are listed in Table 
2, with the age-standardized incidence estimates for 1999-2002 and 2003-2007, the 
corresponding APC and three-standard-error confidence intervals. Rare cancer dots in the plot 
seem to be distributed fairly symmetrically around the zero-change line, indicating no major 
systematic shifts in incidence. Overall there was a slight increase: the average APC for all the 
entities was +2.3% per year.  There was a significant increase in incidence (99.8%) for 16 rare 
cancers, and a significant decrease for ten. Trends of rare cancers did not substantially differ 
from those of common cancers (data not shown), whose average annual change was +0.9%. 
Only prostate and skin cancers had an APC greater than 2%, while only epithelial cancers of the 
stomach decreased more than 2%.  
Survival increased from 1999-2001 to 2005-2007 for the majority of rare cancers. The cloud of 
points in Figure 2 is skewed upward from the zero line, corresponding to a mean increase in 
survival, averaged over all the entities, of about 5.7 percent points. Twenty-four rare cancers 
presented significant survival increases (Table 3), while only one (other myelodysplastic 
syndromes) had a slight but significant decrease. Rare cancers with the largest survival increases 
 13 
 
were mainly hematological: chronic myeloid leukemia, diffuse B cell lymphoma, follicular 
lymphoma, precursor B/T lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma, and multiple myeloma. Well 
represented among the top tumors with increasing survival were sarcomas, specifically of the 
viscera, trunk, and Kaposi sarcoma. Survival increases higher than five percent points were also 
observed for infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the prostate (12 percent points), poorly differentiated 
endocrine carcinoma of the digestive system (7.5 percent points), and squamous cell carcinoma 
of the oropharynx (7.1 percent points). There were no major improvements for rare cancers of the 
colon, rectum, breast and kidney, differently from the corresponding groups of common cancers 
[8].  
 
Where are rare cancers treated?  
Figure 3 illustrates the extent of centralization of rare cancer treatment, presenting MAV, overall 
and by country, for 38 cancer groups ranked by decreasing incidence. Logarithmic scale is here 
used for the x-axis to made the graph readable despite the huge MAV variability (from 82 to 0.2 
per year) across the considered cancers.  A supplementary Table (see appendix p 3) gives the 
numbers for the graphs. Pooled MAV (Figure 3a) ranged from a maximum of 83 treatments per 
year for head and neck tumors to fewer than 0.5 per year for choriocarcinoma of the placenta, 
some embryonal and endocrine tumors. The higher the incidence, the larger the MAV of treating 
hospitals. The relationship between cancer incidence and MAV in the pool of countries was very 
strong (Pearson coefficient 0.88), though with several outliers. This was the case for epithelial 
tumors of the ovary, which had a higher incidence but a lower MAV than CNS tumors, whose 
patients seemed therefore to be more centralized than ovarian cancer patients (35 vs. 20 cases 
treated per year). Similarly, soft tissue sarcomas had a five times higher incidence, but received 
less centralized treatment than bone sarcomas. Treatment  for for thyroid cancers, uveal 
melanoma and several embryonal tumors appeared to be fairly concentrated in few hospitals with 
 14 
 
relatively high volumes. In contrast, tumors of the urinary tract, gastro-entero-pancreatic 
neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NET), small intestine, non-epithelial ovary cancers, and NET of 
skin were treated in centers with an even lower MAV than would be expected because of their 
very low occurrence.  
With some exceptions, country-specific patterns of MAV reflected the overall picture. Differently 
from what found in the other countries, the management of epithelial ovarian cancers was highly 
centralised In Bulgaria and Slovenia. CNS patients were treated in highly centralized structures in 
all countries except Finland and Navarra. Treatment for uveal melanoma and retinoblastoma was 
not centralized in Bulgaria and, again, in Navarra. Slovenia and the Netherlands had the highest 
centralization patterns, while MAV for the majority of cancers was very low in Navarra. 
Table 4 presents, for each country and 29 rare cancers, the annual number of cases diagnosed, 
the number of top-volume hospitals treating at least 75% of national cases, and the average 
annual numbers of treatments provided. Taking for example head and neck cancers, 3/4 of 
patients were centralized in two top hospitals in Slovenia (2 million population, 266 treatments per 
hospital per year), and 12 top hospitals in the Netherlands (17 million population, 201 treatments 
per hospital per year). The level of centralization was lower in the other countries, resulting in a 
caseload of 145 in the ten Bulgarian top hospitals, 106 in the 29 Belgian hospitals, and 
respectively 83, 77, and 63 in Finland, Navarra and Ireland. The Netherlands and Slovenia had 
the highest treatment volumes out of the 29 considered, with 12 rare cancers each. 
 
Discussion 
Rare cancers make up one quarter of all malignancies. They are a very heterogeneous group of 
almost 200 cancers, mostly solid, constituting from 2% of all skin cancers up to 32% of all female 
genital cancers. We confirmed the lower five-year survival for rare than common cancers (49% 
vs. 63%), and for all cancer families except  thoracic cancers. The disadvantage persisted even 
 15 
 
after excluding common cancers with good prognosis, of prostate, breast and skin. Several 
factors help explain these differences: the biology of the diseases, adequacies of diagnosis and 
treatment, lack of effective therapies, or lack of evidence-based treatment guidelines. 
A novelty of this study is the analysis of incidence and survival trends. Overall, incidence rose by 
2.3% a year from 1999 up to 2007. The increase was substantial for several rare cancers (Figure 
1). Some of the increase can probably be attributed to improvement in pathological diagnosis,  
new entity codes in the ICD-O-3 and to the time needed to adapt the coding procedures. This is 
the case of GIST, large cell carcinoma of the lung, neuroendocrine tumours and many 
hematological codes [9-11]. For other rare cancers, increases in incidence may be due to better 
pathological diagnosis, like for the neuroendocrine tumors. For thyroid carcinoma several authors 
have suggested an increase in over-diagnosis [12]. However, increased exposure to risk factors 
may explain higher incidence rates for oropharynx and anal canal squamous cell cancers due to 
human papillomavirus (HPV) [13,14] and for adenocarcinoma of the esophagus, perhaps due to 
increasing obesity or gastro-esophageal reflux [15]. The lower squamous cell carcinoma cervix 
incidence might reflect organised cervical screening programs. The drop in incidence for some of 
the rare cancers was due to the still falling prevalence [16] of smoking . 
RS improved by about 3% overall, slightly less than for common cancers (5.5%, data not shown), 
suggesting that investments were more focused on these latter.  Also, over-diagnosis is expected 
to affect more common than rare cancers. Success was greatest for chronic myeloid leukemia 
(CML) with a five-year gain in survival of 21% across the study years, largely explained by the 
widespread use of new and more effective treatments, such as targeted treatments and more 
effective stem-cell transplantation [17]. For many other hematological cancers, new (targeted) 
drugs, combination with radiotherapy and again improvement in transplantation are responsible 
for the impact on prognosis [18]. Survival also improved for some groups of sarcoma (viscera, 
 16 
 
trunk and limbs) for which multidisciplinary approaches and centralization of treatments may take 
the credit. This may also be true for neuroendocrine tumors [19], biliary tract, liver [20] and 
esophageal cancers [15], for which there are now more specific and effective 
treatments/protocols. For esophageal cancers, earlier detection through Barrett's esophagus 
surveillance practices might also contribute. For oropharyngeal cancers, the larger proportion of 
less aggressive tumors attributed to HPV may have influenced the survival gain [21]. For 
carcinoma of the thyroid and infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the prostate, early diagnosis should 
be the major factor. This would also have contributed to a rise in the proportion of cases that are 
clinically irrelevant, though this is hard to estimate [12, 22]. As found for incidence, some of the 
apparent survival gains may be due to classification changes [9], such as for large cell 
carcinomas of the lung.  
Myeloproliferative neoplasms and myelodysplastic syndromes were not considered cancers until 
the WHO classification was changed in 2001, and their registration started even later [9]. More in 
general, the increases in incidence of some rare cancers could be due to more specific diagnosis 
and coding by registry.  
The hospital volume analysis represents the first attempt to systematically study the place of 
treatment of rare cancers from population-based CR data. Many potentially relevant indications 
can be drawn from this seldom used source of information. However, several important limitations 
must be recognized. Seven CRs cannot be considered as statistically representative of the whole 
European population. Bulgaria, Finland and Navarra only provided information on, at most, three 
treatments: the first surgical, systemic and radiotherapy treatments. However, we estimated from 
the data of the other CRs that this problem only regard  about 1% of all patients.  
The mean admission volume estimates, based on individual patient data and blind administrative 
coding of hospitals, will depend on how cancer services were organized and coded. We cannot 
know if, for some rare cancers and in some countries, hospitals were linked in organized 
 17 
 
networks during the study period, thus overcoming an apparent dispersion of treating structures. 
For example, patients with localised sarcomas or head and neck cancers were more frequently 
treated by small and/or peripheral hospitals [23]. If several hospitals provided different services 
but acted co-operatively as a single specialist center, their estimated volume will depend on 
whether they were identified as a single or separate units.  Our data do not allow identifying in 
detail specific protocols used in the considered hospitals. Hospital volume can be therefore 
considered as an only partial quality indicator, mainly pointing to level of experience in protocol 
application and general management of  rare cancer patients.   
 
There are several suggestions that centralization of care improves outcome for rare cancers [24]. 
This is particularly true when optimal treatment requires complex surgery or high-technology 
radiotherapy equipment. It is beyond the scope of this paper to address the volume-survival 
relationship. Diagnosis and treatment in reference centers are expected to be more accurate 
because they benefit from large numbers of cases, which are often discussed in a 
multidisciplinary setting involving expert professionals. Often centralized sites are connected to 
research centers participating in international debates and research. Disadvantages of 
centralization are the need for patients to move and the risk of a longer waiting list, with 
consequent discomfort and possible negative effects on outcome [25].  
Sometimes, centralisation was only moderately perceived by oncologists as a solution to be 
endorsed for rare cancer patients.[26]  
 
For many of the solid rare cancers, centralization did not seem to have been completely achieved 
during the study period. However, most cases had been diagnosed more than ten years ago 
when centralization for cancer patients did not necessarily have much priority. Centralization 
seemed to be more widely implemented for rare cancers requiring highly specific technologies 
 18 
 
(particularly radiotherapy and nuclear medicine) and for those with long-established evidence-
based guidelines for diagnosis and treatment.  
This was the case for many pediatric tumors, uveal melanoma, anal canal cancers, adrenal 
cortex cancers and, for specific surgical expertise, in CNS cancers and bone sarcomas.  
The degrees of centralization varied across Europe, and to a large extent were affected by the 
population size. In countries with a small population it is easier to concentrate patients in a single 
or few hospitals. High admission volumes are more likely to be achieved in reference centers in 
larger-population countries.  
The results of this part of the study were discussed in the participating countries at dedicated 
meetings attended by public health planners, oncologists, surgeons, representatives of Ministries 
of Health and patient associations. While the general pattern of dispersion was recognised, 
almost all the countries were working at different levels to implement centralization and/or 
network-based organizations for treatment, while still following country-specific priorities [27].  
In Belgium, where all cancer patients can be treated in any hospital with an oncology care 
program, the level of centralization was low. A plan is now under way for the development of 
hospital networks between centers of expertise and other oncology care services/programs. 
Centralization was already ongoing in the Netherlands, mostly for surgical treatment. This was 
reflected in the high admission volumes in this country for many rare cancers (see appendix p 1).  
In Bulgaria rare cancer patients were operated in all hospitals with surgical departments, while 
radiotherapy was concentrated in 17 centers and systemic therapy in 14 oncological hospitals. A 
major issue remains the quality of diagnosis, mainly due to inadequate facilities to diagnose many 
complex rare cancers. The definition of national and international pathways for second opinions 
from expert pathologists was deemed important. With this in mind, the European Reference 
Networks should offer a good opportunity to improve pathologist training through dedicated 
 19 
 
training schemes and fellowships across Europe. Cancer registration remains vital for monitoring 
progress in rare cancer diagnosis and treatment for these patients. 
In Finland, more than 60% of rare cancer patients were treated in five university hospitals. 
Centralization in single national structures was only observed for uveal melanoma and 
retinoblastoma. Further centralization for other rare cancers is impeded by the spread of the 
population over large areas and by administrative constraints on regional health authorities for 
referring cancer patients to the closest university hospital. 
Irish public health authorities, during the period covered by the study, identified, a few centers  to 
treat rare or particularly complex cancers. However, patients were not always correctly referred to 
them. This highlights the need for strong political commitment to ensure centralization, to make 
sure all rare cancer patients receive the highest quality of care.  
Cancer care was highly centralized in Slovenia. In addition, the major hospitals were organized 
on a task-specific basis: radiotherapy was only provided by the National Cancer Center, while 
surgical treatment was more often done in two other major hospitals. Reducing delays in 
diagnosis and treatment was recognized in Slovenia as one of the major challenges in order to 
improve rare cancer outcomes. 
Navarra is a relatively small region of Spain, a country with a highly regionalized health 
organisation. No hospital with national recruitment for rare cancers was operating in Navarra, and 
98% of resident rare cancer patients were treated locally, the majority in the two largest regional 
hospitals. However, the admission volumes of Navarra hospitals are much lower than in all the 
other participating countries, even considering some underestimation due to unregistered patients 
coming from outside the region. This suggests some disadvantages in organizing rare cancer 
treatment on a regional/local basis. 
To conclude, this is the largest study that estimates the burden of rare cancer for Europe, 
including trends in incidence and survival rates. It also provides indicators of rare cancer 
 20 
 
treatment management. In seven European countries we observed - with few exceptions - a low 
level of centralization of treatment for rare cancers. We recognise the importance of population-
based cancer registries in descriptive studies like this, to ensure surveillance. However, the 
quality of the data needs to be improved when morphology, hospital and treatment definitions are 
considered. To this aim, the use of specific data quality indicators, the planning of periodic 
sample-based quality studies and, above all, a wider use of these variables in population based 
studies, with related sensitivity analysis, can be suggested. Furthermore, the international 
classification for cancer have to rapidly include the new entities based on molecular and genomic 
categorization. The latter is a necessary condition for updating a new rare cancers list. 
The European network of cancer registries (ENCR) should work to boost these quality 
improvements and make wider use of the data on rare cancers. The Joint Action of Rare Cancers 
[28] and the European Network for Rare Diseases will profit from these data, which are also 
useful for national and European policies to organize care for rare cancer patients better. The 
RARECAREnet project website includes a search tool with data for all the countries that 
contributed data [3].

Summary  
 5 
 
Background 
Rare cancers here defined as those with an annual incidence rate less than 6/100,000 in Europe, 
 pose challenges for diagnosis, treatments, and clinical decision-making. Information on rare 
cancers is scant. We updated the estimates of the burden of rare cancers in Europe, their time 
trends in incidence and survival, and provide information on centralization of treatments in seven 
European countries. 
Methods 
We analysed data on more than two million rare cancer diagnoses, provided by 83 cancer 
registries, to estimate European incidence and survival in 2000-2007 and the corresponding time 
trends during 1995-2007.  Incidence rates were calculated as the number of new cases divided 
by the corresponding total person years in the population. Five-year relative survival (RS) was 
calculated by the Ederer-2 method. Seven registries (Belgium, Bulgaria, Finland, Ireland, 
Netherlands, Slovenia, and the Navarra region in Spain) provided additional data on hospitals of 
treatment for about 220,000 cases diagnosed in 2000-2007. Hospital volume was calculated as 
the number of treatments provided by each hospital rare cancer group sharing the same referral 
pattern.  
Findings 
Rare cancers accounted for 24% of all cancers diagnosed in EU28 during 2000-2007. The overall 
incidence rose yearly by 2.3%. RS  increased (overall 5.7%), from 1999-2001 to 2007-2009, and 
for the majority of rare cancers, with the largest increases for hematological tumors and 
sarcomas. The level of centralization of rare cancer treatment varied widely between cancers and 
between countries. The Netherlands and Slovenia had the highest treatment volumes. 
Interpretation 
The study profits from the largest pool of population-based registries to estimate incidence and 
survival of about 200 rare cancers. Incidence trends can be explained by changes in known risk 
 6 
 
factors, improved diagnosis, and registration problems. Survival could be improved by early 
diagnosis, new treatments and better case management. There is ample room for improving the 
centralization of treatment in these seven European countries. 
The research was funded by the European Commission (Chafea) [Grant No. 2000111201]. 
 
Introduction 
The RARECARE project defined rare cancers as those with an annual incidence rate less than 
6/100,000 in Europe (EU), and showed that about one in five were rare types and slightly more 
than four million rare cancers were prevalent in the EU population [1]. Because of their low 
numbers, the almost 200 rare cancers listed by RARECARE pose challenges for diagnosis, 
treatments, and clinical decision-making. Clinical trials are rare too, and it is hard to build up new 
knowledge and expertise.  
There is a broad consensus that the diagnostic pathologic confirmation and primary treatment of 
rare cancers, in particular, should be centralized in reference centers and/or in collaborative 
networks, with multidisciplinary approaches [2] and very specific expertise. In addition, clinical 
and translational research calls for a high level of centralization and international collaboration. To 
what extent appropriate policies for rare cancer patients are implemented at the country level has 
seldom been studied.  As a consequence, information for policy makers and stakeholders is 
scarce for many of these tumors. 
The project Information Network on Rare Cancers (RARECAREnet) is designed to update 
epidemiological information on rare cancers in the EU [3], to provide indicators at the country 
level, time trends, and to study to what extent treatment is centralized in Europe.  
This paper provides up-to-date incidence and survival estimates based on data collected from 94 
population-based cancer registries (CRs), for 198 rare cancers diagnosed in 2000-2007 and for 
 7 
 
12 major families of rare cancers. It also presents data on the levels of centralization for rare 
cancers in selected European countries.  
Material and Methods 
Patients 
The data were extracted from two databases. The first, the descriptive analysis database, is a 
subset of the EUROCARE-5 database [4]. It includes incidence and follow-up data provided by 
European population-based CRs regarding cancer patients diagnosed in the period  Jan 1,1978, 
to Dec 31, 2007.1978-2007. Vital status was updated to  Dec 31,  2008.the end of 2008. From the 
117 CRs participating in EUROCARE-5, we excluded specialized pediatric CRs, the Swedish and 
Turin CRs, because they did not participate in the RARECAREnet study, and the Danish CR, 
because it provided none of the details on morphology needed to define rare cancers. Details of 
the RARECAREnet database can be found in the report on the project website [5]. For the 
analysis of incidence we excluded 11 CRs specialized in specific anatomical sites to avoid 
incomplete coverage of some cancer entities affecting multiple sites such as neuroendocrine 
tumors. A total of 1,984,147 rare cancer diagnoses were considered for incidence estimates in 
2000-2007, collected by 83 CRs from 1,566 million person-years of observation. Data for 
incidence trends came from 42 CRs covering the period 1995-2007, and included 2,268,602 
cases, and 1,900 million person-years of observation. Survival estimates in 2000-2007 for all the 
rare cancers were based on a total of 1,994,346 diagnoses, observed by 94 CRs. Case identified 
only with death certificate (DCO) or casually discovered at autopsy were excluded from the 
analysis because they do not report time of survival. Cases lost to follow-up were considered as 
censored at the date of last contact.  Multiple primaries in a same patient were included. Death 
certificate only (DCO) and autopsy cases were excluded but data included multiple primaries in a 
single patient. Finally, survival trend analysis was based on 1,649,309 rare cancer diagnoses 
from 45 CRs providing uninterrupted data from at least Jan 1, 1995 to Dec 31, 2007.  
 8 
 
1995 to 2007.  
The second database was used for the study of hospitals of treatment and hospital volume. It comes 
from seven European CRs: the national CRs of Belgium, Bulgaria, Finland, Ireland, Netherlands, 
Slovenia, and the regional CR of Navarra (Spain). This last, although regional, was added in 
consideration of the regional organization of the Spanish health care system. These CRs were selected 
to reflect the variability of incidence and survival in Europe [1,5], and because they could provide 
detailed data for all 198 rare cancers. Variables included: sex, dates of birth and diagnosis, from the 
International Classification of Disease for Oncology version 3 ICDO-3 topography and morphology 
codes from the International Classification of Disease for Oncology version 3 (ICDO-3), grading, 
pathological and clinical TNM, simplified stage (localized, regional extension, metastatic), treatment 
(surgery, radiotherapy, systemic, other or none), vital status, date of closure of follow-up or death, 
hospital of diagnosis and hospital of treatment.  DCO and autopsy cases (1.3% overall, with a 
maximum of 8.6% in Bulgaria) were not included. The hospital of diagnosis was defined as the hospital 
where the pathology examination was done or requested. The hospital of treatment(s) was defined as 
the hospital where a specific treatment (e.g. surgery) or the first course of systemic therapy (e.g. 
chemotherapy) was given. Up to five different types of treatment within one year from the date of 
diagnosis were considered as a primary treatment. Vital status was further updated, with respect to the 
descriptive analysis database, to Dec 31, 2012.to the end of 2012.  
We received data on about 348,000 rare cancers diagnosed in the period 2000-2007. However, 
national data from Belgium were limited to the period of diagnosis 2004-2007, and those from Navarra 
to 2000-2005. Cases diagnosed in Bulgaria and the Netherlands during 2000-2004 were removed on 
account of incomplete national coverage of hospital information. A total of 223,081 rare cancer cases 
were included in the hospital volume study database. Unspecific morphologies (8000, 8001, 8010, 
8800, 9800, 9590) were found in 2.1% of cases, with the highest proportion (4.1%) in Finland. 
Seventeen per cent of cases (37,959/223,081) was removed, because for them the information of 
hospital was missing. 
 
Methods 
Rationale of the definition of rare cancer entities and their classification in terms of ICD-O codes 
are reported elsewhere [1,2,5]. Classification was structured in way to avoid any overlapping 
among rare entities. For example, GEP NET and GIST tumours were under the families of NET 
and sarcomas, and not also in digestive rare cancers. 
Incidence rates were estimated as the number of new cases arising in 2000-2007 divided by the 
corresponding total person years (male + female) in the general population. The European 
standard population was used for direct age standardization. New cases in 2013 in EU28 were 
 9 
 
calculated by multiplying age- and sex-specific incidence rates in 2000-2007 by the 
corresponding European population classified in five-year age classes on 1 January 2013. 
Incidence variation over time was estimated restricting the analysis to 1,480,424 cases diagnosed 
in the two sub-periods 1999-2002 and 2003-07, and was presented in a funnel plot where each 
dot represents a single rare cancer, the y-axis displays the estimated difference in terms of 
annual percent change (APC) of age-adjusted incidence, and the x-axis the corresponding 
precision in terms of the inverse of its standard error. APC was calculated as the ratio between 
incidence rates for the two sub-periods elevated to 1/4.5, the inverse of their mean time distance. 
Three-standard-deviation confidence intervals for estimated zero changes [6] are represented by 
two symmetrical lines progressively approaching the x-axis with increasing x values. Dots lying 
above or below the area between them correspond respectively to tumors with 99.8% significantly 
higher or lower incidence rates. 
Five-year relative survival (RS) was estimated as the ratio of observed to expected survival in the 
general population, matched by age, sex, calendar year, and geographical area, and calculated 
by the Ederer-2 method [7].  RS time trends were estimated by the period approach considering 
three follow-up periods: 1999-2001 (cohorts diagnosed  in Jan 1,1995 to Dec 31, 2001in 1995-
2001), 2002-04 (cohorts diagnosed in  Jan 1,1998 to Dec 31, 20041998-2004), and 2005-07 
(cohorts diagnosed in  Jan 1, 2001 to Dec 31, 20072001-07). RS changes were presented as a 
funnel plot, similarly to incidence changes, but using the difference between five-year RS in the 
last and first of these periods on the y-axis. 
The volume (number) of treatments provided by each hospital was calculated for major cancer groups, 
defined by aggregating all the solid rare cancers into 38 groups sharing the same referral pattern (see 
Figure 3). For example, all the 17 head and neck tumors, identified [1] as clinically distinct rare entities, 
 head and neck tumors are usually referred to head and neck specialized services, and were 
considered as a single group. Hematological rare tumors, not always requiring hospitalization, 
were not considered in the volume analysis.  Hospital volume for each of the 38 groups was then 
 10 
 
computed as the annual number of any treatment delivered by the hospital, for all the cancers in 
that group. Repeated admissions to the same hospital for the same cancer and the same 
treatment type (i.e. surgery, radiotherapy or systemic therapy) were considered as a single 
admission and counted as one treatment in the analyses. Instead, repeated admissions for 
several treatment types (such as radiotherapy and subsequent surgery) given to a patient in the 
same hospital were all counted as treatments. Untreated patients were assigned to the hospital of 
diagnosis. The total number of treatments provided by each hospital for a given group of rare 
cancers was then divided by the number of years of observation to provide its mean annual 
hospital volume.  
Finally, for each patient we calculated the mean annual volume of the hospital(s) where they were 
treated, so obtaining a patient-specific measure with a much less skewed distribution with respect to 
the hospital-specific volume.. Averaging this measure over all the patients diagnosed with a given 
group of rare cancers in a certain country gives a cancer- and country-specific measure of the level of 
expertise that patients can expect for the treatment of their tumor. We called it the mean admission 
volume (MAV) indicator.

Results 
Burden of rare cancers in Europe 
Table 1 provides incidence and survival estimates for each of the 198 rare cancers, for 63 groups 
of rare cancers (capital letters), for the 12 wider families in which rare cancers are hierarchically 
grouped, and for six common cancer groups.  Hematological malignancies, rare cancers of 
female genital organs and of the digestive tract, and head and neck cancers were families with 
the highest overall incidence rates (from 15 to 28/100,000/year). Thoracic cancers, male genital 
and urological, endocrine organs, central nervous system (CNS) tumors and sarcomas had 
 11 
 
overall incidence rates from 5 to 8/100,000. Rare skin cancers and non-cutaneous melanoma, 
and embryonal cancers were the families with the lowest rates (1.22 and 0.34 per 100,000). 
Overall, rare cancers accounted for 24% of all cancers diagnosed in EU28 during 2000-2007; by 
far the majority were solid cancers (76%). For sex-specific rare cancers, we also provide in 
supplementary table (see appendix p xxx41) sex specific incidence rates. 
Five-year RS of all rare cancers together was 49%, compared to 63% for all common cancers.  
Rare cancers also had lower survival within the families of digestive cancers (15% vs. 41%), 
female genital cancers (58% vs. 82%), male genital and urologic cancers (74% vs. 76%), skin 
cancers (70% vs. 96%) and hematological tumors (51% vs. 61%). The only exception was the 
group of thoracic cancers (13% vs. 10%), where common cancers included squamous cell 
carcinoma of the lung - with a very bad prognosis (6% after five years).  Families including only 
rare cancers had five-year RS ranging from high, as for embryonal and endocrine organ tumors 
(79% and 88%), to intermediate, for sarcomas (60%), neuroendocrine (54%) and head & neck 
tumors (52%), and low for CNS tumors (21%).  
Time trends of incidence and survival for rare cancers are shown in Figures 1 and 2. Cancers 
whose incidence variation fell outside the confidence interval shown in Figure 1 are listed in Table 
2, with the age-standardized incidence estimates for 1999-2002 and 2003-2007, the 
corresponding APC and three-standard-error confidence intervals. Rare cancer dots in the plot 
seem to be distributed fairly symmetrically around the zero-change line, indicating no major 
systematic shifts in incidence. Overall there was a slight increase: the average APC for all the 
entities was +2.3% per year.  There was a significant increase in incidence (99.8%) for 16 rare 
cancers, and a significant decrease for ten. Trends of rare cancers did not substantially differ 
from those of common cancers (data not shown), whose average annual change was +0.9%. 
Only prostate and skin cancers had an APC greater than 2%, while only epithelial cancers of the 
stomach decreased more than 2%.  
 12 
 
Survival increased from 1999-2001 to 2005-2007 for the majority of rare cancers. The cloud of 
points in Figure 2 is skewed upward from the zero line, corresponding to a mean increase in 
survival, averaged over all the entities, of about 5.7 percent points. Twenty-four rare cancers 
presented significant survival increases (Table 3), while only one (other myelodysplastic 
syndromes) had a slight but significant decrease. Rare cancers with the largest survival increases 
were mainly hematological: chronic myeloid leukemia, diffuse B cell lymphoma, follicular 
lymphoma, precursor B/T lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma, and multiple myeloma. Well 
represented among the top tumors with increasing survival were sarcomas, specifically of the 
viscera, trunk, and Kaposi sarcoma. Survival increases higher than five percent points were also 
observed for infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the prostate (12 percent points), poorly differentiated 
endocrine carcinoma of the digestive system (7.5 percent points), and squamous cell carcinoma 
of the oropharynx (7.1 percent points). There were no major improvements for rare cancers of the 
colon, rectum, breast and kidney, differently from the corresponding groups of common cancers 
[8].  
 
Where are rare cancers treated?  
Figure 3 illustrates the extent of centralization of rare cancer treatment, presenting MAV, overall and by 
country, for 38 cancer groups ranked by decreasing incidence. Logarithmic scale is here used for the x-
axis to made the graph readable despite the huge MAV variability (from 82 to 0.2 per year) across the 
considered cancers.  A supplementary Table (see appendix p xxx43) Supplementary Table 1 gives the 
numbers for the graphs. Pooled MAV (Figure 3a) ranged from a maximum of 83 treatments per year for 
head and neck tumors to fewer than 0.5 per year for choriocarcinoma of the placenta, some embryonal 
and endocrine tumors. The higher the incidence, the larger the MAV of treating hospitals. The 
relationship between cancer incidence and MAV in the pool of countries was very strong (Pearson 
coefficient 0.88), though with several outliers. This was the case for epithelial tumors of the ovary, 
which had a higher incidence but a lower MAV than CNS tumors, whose patients seemed therefore to 
be more centralized than ovarian cancer patients (35 vs. 20 cases treated per year). Similarly, soft 
tissue sarcomas had a five times higher incidence, but received less centralized treatment than bone 
sarcomas. Treatment  for for thyroid cancers, uveal melanoma and several embryonal tumors appeared 
to be fairly concentrated in few hospitals with relatively high volumes. In contrast, tumors of the urinary 
tract, gastro-entero-pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NET), small intestine, non-epithelial ovary 
 13 
 
cancers, and NET of skin were treated in centers with an even lower MAV than would be expected 
because of their very low occurrence.  
With some exceptions, country-specific patterns of MAV reflected the overall picture. Differently from 
what found in the other countries, the management of epithelial ovarian cancers was highly centralised 
In Bulgaria and Slovenia.Centralization of epithelial ovarian cancers was not low in Bulgaria and 
Slovenia. CNS patients were treated in highly centralized structures in all countries except Finland and 
Navarra. Treatment for uveal melanoma and retinoblastoma was not centralized in Bulgaria and, again, 
in Navarra. Slovenia and the Netherlands had the highest centralization patterns, while MAV for the 
majority of cancers was very low in Navarra. 
Table 4 presents, for each country and 29 rare cancers, the annual number of cases diagnosed, 
the number of top-volume hospitals treating at least 75% of national cases, and the average 
annual numbers of treatments provided. Taking for example head and neck cancers, 3/4 of 
patients were centralized in two top hospitals in Slovenia (2 million population, 266 treatments per 
hospital per year), and 12 top hospitals in the Netherlands (17 million population, 201 treatments 
per hospital per year). The level of centralization was lower in the other countries, resulting in a 
caseload of 145 in the ten Bulgarian top hospitals, 106 in the 29 Belgian hospitals, and 
respectively 83, 77, and 63 in Finland, Navarra and Ireland. The Netherlands and Slovenia had 
the highest treatment volumes out of the 29 considered, with 12 rare cancers each. 
 
Discussion 
 
Rare cancers make up one quarter of all malignancies. They are a very heterogeneous group of 
almost 200 cancers, mostly solid, constituting from 2% of all skin cancers up to 32% of all female 
genital cancers. We confirmed the lower five-year survival for rare than common cancers (49% 
vs. 63%), and for all cancer families except  thoracic cancers. The disadvantage persisted even 
after excluding common cancers with good prognosis, of prostate, breast and skin. Several 
factors help explain these differences: the biology of the diseases, adequacies of diagnosis and 
treatment, lack of effective therapies, or lack of evidence-based treatment guidelines. 
 14 
 
A novelty of this study is the analysis of incidence and survival trends. Overall, incidence rose by 
2.3% a year from 1999 up to 2007. The increase was substantial for several rare cancers (Figure 
1). Some of the increase can probably be attributed to improvement in pathological diagnosis,  
new entity codes in the ICD-O-3 and to the time needed to adapt the coding procedures. This is 
the case of GIST, large cell carcinoma of the lung, neuroendocrine tumours and many 
hematological codes [9-11]. For other rare cancers, increases in incidence may be due to better 
pathological diagnosis, like for the neuroendocrine tumors. For thyroid carcinoma several authors 
have suggested an increase in over-diagnosis [12]. However, increased exposure to risk factors 
may explain higher incidence rates for oropharynx and anal canal squamous cell cancers due to 
human papillomavirus (HPV) [13,14] and for adenocarcinoma of the esophagus, perhaps due to 
increasing obesity or gastro-esophageal reflux [15]. The lower squamous cell carcinoma cervix 
incidence might reflect organised cervical screening programs. The drop in incidence for some of 
the rare cancers was due to the still falling prevalence of smoking [16]. 
RS improved by about 3% overall, slightly less than for common cancers (5.5%, data not shown), 
suggesting that investments were more focused on these latter.  Also, over-diagnosis is expected 
to affect more common than rare cancers. Success was greatest for chronic myeloid leukemia 
(CML) with a five-year gain in survival of 21% across the study years, largely explained by the 
widespread use of new and more effective treatments, such as targeted treatments and more 
effective stem-cell transplantation [17]. For many other hematological cancers, new (targeted) 
drugs, combination with radiotherapy and again improvement in transplantation are responsible 
for the impact on prognosis [18]. Survival also improved for some groups of sarcoma (viscera, 
trunk and limbs) for which multidisciplinary approaches and centralization of treatments may take 
the credit. This may also be true for neuroendocrine tumors [19], biliary tract, liver [20] and 
esophageal cancers [15], for which there are now more specific and effective 
treatments/protocols. For esophageal cancers, earlier detection through Barrett's esophagus 
 15 
 
surveillance practices might also contribute. For oropharyngeal cancers, the larger proportion of 
less aggressive tumors attributed to HPV may have influenced the survival gain [21]. For 
carcinoma of the thyroid and infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the prostate, early diagnosis should 
be the major factor. This would also have contributed to a rise in the proportion of cases that are 
clinically irrelevant, though this is hard to estimate [12, 22]. As found for incidence,  
Like for incidence, some of the apparent survival gains may be due to classification changes [9], 
such as for large cell carcinomas of the lung.  
Myeloproliferative neoplasms and myelodysplastic syndromes were not considered cancers until 
the WHO classification was changed in 2001, and their registration started even later [9]. More in 
general, the increases in incidence of some rare cancers could be due to more specific diagnosis 
and coding by registry.  
The hospital volume analysis represents the first attempt to systematically study the place of 
treatment of rare cancers from population-based CR data. Many potentially relevant indications 
can be drawn from this seldom used source of information. However, several important limitations 
must be recognized. Seven CRs cannot be considered as statistically representative of the whole 
European population. Bulgaria, Finland and Navarra only provided information on, at most, three 
treatments: the first surgical, systemic and radiotherapy treatments. However, we estimated from 
the data of the other CRs that this problem only regard  about 1% of all patients.  
The mean admission volume estimates, based on individual patient data and blind administrative 
coding of hospitals, will depend on how cancer services were organized and coded. We cannot 
know if, for some rare cancers and in some countries, hospitals were linked in organized 
networks during the study period, thus overcoming an apparent dispersion of treating structures. 
For example, patients with localised sarcomas or head and neck cancers were more frequently 
treated by small and/or peripheral hospitals [23]. If several hospitals provided different services 
but acted co-operatively as a single specialist center, their estimated volume will depend on 
 16 
 
whether they were identified as a single or separate units.  Our data do not allow identifying in 
detail specific protocols used in the considered hospitals. Hospital volume can be therefore 
considered as an only partial quality indicator, mainly pointing to level of experience in protocol 
application and general management of  rare cancer patients.  Not all the seven CRs participating 
in this part of the study were able to provide the admission dates, so we could not analyse the 
treatment delay and timings. Bulgaria, Finland and Navarra only provided information on, at most, 
three treatments: the first surgical, systemic and radiotherapy treatments. However, our definition 
of hospital admission volume was based on one admission per treatment type per hospital, so we 
only lose duplicated surgical or systemic treatments done in different hospitals. We estimated 
from the data of the other CRs that this only happens for about 1% of all patients.  
The use of individual patient data only provides a partial picture of cancer care organization in a 
country. We cannot exclude that, for some rare cancers and in some countries, hospitals were 
linked in organized networks during the study period, thus overcoming an apparent dispersion of 
treating structures. For example, patients with localised sarcomas or head and neck cancers 
were more frequently treated by small and/or peripheral hospitals [23]. In some countries several 
hospitals provide different services but act co-operatively as a single specialist center. Finally, 
seven CRs cannot be considered as statistically representative of the whole European 
population.  
There are several suggestions that centralization of care improves outcome for rare cancers [24]. 
This is particularly true when optimal treatment requires complex surgery or high-technology 
radiotherapy equipment. It is beyond the scope of this paper to address the volume-survival 
relationship. Diagnosis and treatment in reference centers are expected to be more accurate 
because they benefit from large numbers of cases, which are often discussed in a 
multidisciplinary setting involving expert professionals. Often centralized sites are connected to 
research centers participating in international debates and research. Disadvantages of 
 17 
 
centralization are the need for patients to move and the risk of a longer waiting list, with 
consequent discomfort and possible negative effects on outcome [25].  
Sometimes, centralisation was only moderately perceived by oncologists as a solution to be 
endorsed for rare cancer patients.[26]  
National cancer plans should specifically address the needs of rare cancer patients from 
diagnosis to treatment and palliative care, regulate their referral to centers of expertise while 
avoiding bottleneck effects in the designated hospitals, and include periodic evaluation of 
outcomes. For very rare diseases and small countries, international networks could be the best 
option. 
For many of the solid rare cancers, centralization did not seem to have been completely achieved 
during the study period. However, most cases had been diagnosed more than ten years ago 
when centralization for cancer patients did not necessarily have much priority. Centralization 
seemed to be more widely implemented for rare cancers requiring highly specific technologies 
(particularly radiotherapy and nuclear medicine) and for those with long-established evidence-
based guidelines for diagnosis and treatment. This was the case for many pediatric tumors, uveal 
melanoma, anal canal cancers, adrenal cortex cancers and, for specific surgical expertise, in 
CNS cancers and bone sarcomas. Our data also suggest that centralization is implemented less 
for cancers affecting the elderly. From our data, 26% of rare cancers affect patients aged over 75 
(not shown), for whom systemic therapy is often preferred to surgery more than for younger 
cases.  
The degrees of centralization varied across Europe, and to a large extent were affected by the 
population size. In countries with a small population it is easier to concentrate patients in a single 
or few hospitals. High admission volumes are more likely to be achieved in reference centers in 
larger-population countries.  
 18 
 
The results of this part of the study were discussed in the participating countries at dedicated 
meetings attended by public health planners, oncologists, surgeons, representatives of Ministries 
of Health and patient associations. While the general pattern of dispersion was recognised, 
almost all the countries were working at different levels to implement centralization and/or 
network-based organizations for treatment, while still following country-specific priorities [2627].  
Belgium and the Netherlands are the two largest countries in the study. In Belgium, where all 
cancer patients can be treated in any hospital with an oncology care program, the level of 
centralization was low. The need was recognized to improve collaboration, centralization of care 
and knowledge sharing. A plan is now under way for the development of hospital networks 
between centers of expertise for rare cancers and other oncology care services/programs. 
Centralization was already ongoing in the Netherlands, mostly for surgical treatment. This was 
reflected in the high admission volumes in this country for many rare cancers (see Table 
S1appendix p xxx41).  
In Bulgaria rare cancer patients were operated in all hospitals with surgical departments, while 
radiotherapy was concentrated in 17 centers and systemic therapy in 14 oncological hospitals. A 
major issue remains the quality of diagnosis, mainly due to inadequate facilities and abilities to 
diagnose many complex rare cancers. The definition of national and international pathways for 
second opinions from expert pathologists was also deemed important. With this in mind, the 
European Reference Networks should offer a good opportunity to improve pathologist training 
through dedicated training schemes and fellowships across Europe. Cancer registration remains 
vital for monitoring progress in rare cancer diagnosis and treatment for these patients. 
In Finland, more than 60% of rare cancer patients were treated in five university hospitals. 
Centralization in single national structures was only observed for uveal melanoma and 
retinoblastoma. Further centralization for other rare cancers is impeded by the spread of the 
 19 
 
population over large areas and by administrative constraints on regional health authorities for 
referring cancer patients to the closest university hospital. 
Irish public health authorities, during the period covered by the study, identified, a few centers  to 
treat rare or particularly complex cancers. However, patients were not always correctly referred to 
them. This highlights the need for strong political commitment to ensure centralization, to make 
sure all rare cancer patients receive the highest quality of care.  
Cancer care was highly centralized in Slovenia. In addition, the major hospitals were organized 
on a task-specific basis: radiotherapy was only provided by the National Cancer Center, while 
surgical treatment was more often done in two other major hospitals. Reducing delays in 
diagnosis and treatment was recognized in Slovenia as one of the major challenges in order to 
improve rare cancer outcomes. 
Navarra is a relatively small region of Spain, a country with a highly regionalized health 
organisation. No hospital with national recruitment for rare cancers was operating in Navarra, and 
98% of resident rare cancer patients were treated locally, the majority in the two largest regional 
hospitals. However, the admission volumes of Navarra hospitals are much lower than in all the 
other participating countries, even considering some underestimation due to unregistered patients 
coming from outside the region. This suggests some disadvantages in organizing rare cancer 
treatment on a regional/local basis. 
To conclude, this is the largest study that estimates the burden of rare cancer for Europe, including 
trends in incidence and survival rates. It also provides indicators of rare cancer treatment management. 
In seven European countries we observed - with few exceptions - a low level of centralization of 
treatment for rare cancers. We recognise the importance of population-based cancer registries in 
descriptive studies like this, to ensure surveillance. However, the quality of the data needs to be 
improved when morphology, hospital and treatment definitions are considered. To this aim, the use of 
specific data quality indicators, the planning of periodic sample-based quality studies and, above all, a 
wider use of these variables in population based studies, with related sensitivity analysis, can be 
suggested. Furthermore, the international classification for cancer have to rapidly include the new 
entities based on molecular and genomic categorization. The latter is a necessary condition for 
updating a new rare cancers list. 
 20 
 
The European network of cancer registries (ENCR) should work to boost these quality 
improvements and make wider use of the data on rare cancers. The Joint Action of Rare Cancers 
[2728] and the European Network for Rare Diseases will profit from these data, which are also 
useful for national and European policies to organize care for rare cancer patients better. The 
RARECAREnet project website includes a search tool with data for all the countries that 
contributed data [3].

Manuscript reference number: THELANCETONCOLOGY-D-17-00424 
Title: Burden, time trends and centralized treatment of rare tumors: a European perspective. The 
RARECAREnet Project 
Replies to Reviewer 1 
 
This is a very interesting study addressing the incidence or rare cancers in EU, by pooling together the 
data from cancer registries collected in 90' and 00'. This represents a follow-up of a previous effort, by 
an experienced group, with addition information on evolution of incidence and 5-year survival. The 
limits of the methods are described and carefully considered . The results are of importance at the time 
of the ERN as rightly pointed out. The following points need to be addressed to improve the quality of 
the manuscript. 
 
Major points: 
 
1. I noted imprecisions and non-consistent data in the first tables. For instance, the incidence of 
gastrointestinal stromal sarcoma (GIST) is 0.30, notably inferior to what is known now. There may be 
overlaps between organ based classification ( eg gyne) and histologies (NET, sarcoma; eg : getting 
back to the same example, are gist also present in visceral sarcoma?  
Replay: It is true, incidence of GIST is underestimated. This was recognized in several papers studying 
GIST from population-based data. The new ICD-O code of GIST was at the beginning underused   by 
pathologists. However, its use is increasing, as suggested by the growing trend (Fig and Table ).We 
can mainly attribute the rising incidence trend for GIST to the introduction of the new code and to its 
rising use in Europe. Now, we have stressed more the point in the discussion, page14. There is no 
overlapping use of ICD-O codes in our rare cancers classification, thus GIST is not included in visceral 
sarcoma, nor NET in epithelial tumours, and so on.  
2. The writing is often technical for a mostly oncology reader. For instance, to which extent DCO, MAV 
are commonly used criteria in other published experience. This could be improved relatively easily. 
Replay: We tried to remove throughout the manuscript all the unnecessary technicalities. In particular, 
we tried to make more clear the use of the MAV indicator that, to our knowledge, has been for the first 
time used in this work.  
3. A more precise discussion on what should be done to monitor better incidence and 5-year survival 
rate, in the discussion section would be very useful. 
Replay: We expanded this issue in the discussion (page 20). 
4. More detailed legends would be useful for the figures 
Replay: we have improved them.  
 
Minor points 
*Reply to Reviewers Comments
 2 
 
 
1. The discussion could be condensed and shortened. 
Replay: we little shortened the discussion.  
 
 
Reviewer #2: General comments 
 
Much of what is presented here simply updates and refreshes these authors' previous publication in the 
European Journal of Cancer. What is novel is the attempt to estimate the extent to which, in different 
jurisdictions, the treatment of rare cancers is centralised. This is an important contribution to our 
knowledge concerning how best to organise cancer services and will, in the future, prove useful in 
assessing the effects of increased or decreased centralisation on outcomes for patients with rare 
cancers. 
Replay:  We agree, and we also provided for the first time incidence and survival trends. We intended 
to provide a baseline analysis relevant to the European efforts on rare cancers with the Joint Action and 
the European Reference Network. 
  
Nearly one quarter of all cancers in Europe are rare cancers: the definition used here is of 6/100,000. 
Others have used absolute prevalence of 200,000 (FDA) or <15/100,000 (Greenlee et al 2010). 
Estimates of rare cancer incidence will depend critically on the criteria used for lumping and splitting 
within the ICDO classification. If head and neck cancer were to be considered as a group of tumours, 
rather than as 17 separate entities, then its incidence rate at 18.2/100,000 is well above any of these 
thresholds. 
Replay:  In the US, the American Cancer Society adopted our cut off for its recent report 
https://www.cancer.org/research/cancer-facts-statistics/all-cancer-facts-figures/cancer-facts-figures-
2017.html. The same was for the Japanese and other European countries papers.  
Actually, epithelial H&N tumours are considered as both a single broad family including, 17 clinically 
distinct rare entities. This example is now better clarified at page 10. This point addresses the structure 
of rare cancers classification. The first paragraph added to the Method section refers to the relevant 
sources describing rationale and structure of our classification. We think this could be sufficient for 
documentation, and would avoid a long additional paragraph in the present article (Page 9) 
  
Centralisation & Expertise 
 
1. I suspect that the figures for mean annual hospital volume are highly skewed (no data shown). This 
calls into question the use of means, rather than medians, in the analysis. This potential objection is 
probably answered by their use of regionally-based mean admission volume as the metric of interest. 
The mean admission volume is effectively a weighted average, and this approach should compensate 
for any difficulties imposed by unequal distributions of activity at the level of the individual centres. 
Perhaps this advantage of their approach needs to be made more explicit. 
 3 
 
Replay. The reviewer is right: the volume distribution among hospitals is highly left-skewed because 
many hospitals have low volume and very few have high volumes. When considered among patients, 
the volume distribution is much less skewed because many patients are treated in those few high 
volume hospitals.  According to our definition, MAV can be also interpreted as the mean of hospital 
specific volumes  weighted by the number of patients treated. As a consequence, the median 
admission volume over all patients for a given cancer/country combination is not too different from the 
orresponding mean admission volume (MAV) mostly ranging within 0.7-1.2. Correlation between mean 
and median admission volumes over all the entities is between 0.97 and 0.99 for all countries, so they 
basically provide the same information. We added a sentence at the last paragraph of the Methods 
section, Page 10. 
 
2. The mean admission volume estimates will, to a considerable extent, depend upon how specialist 
cancer services are organised. If a biopsy is performed at one hospital, then the patient is referred to 
another hospital for specialist surgery, and then to a third hospital for radiotherapy and chemotherapy, 
then the activity per hospital will be low. If, however, the separate hospitals are grouped 
administratively as a single cancer centre or network then the unit activity will be correspondingly 
higher. The authors' approach is, therefore, sensitive to the way in which cancer services are 
organised, perhaps this is something that ought to be more fully acknowledged as a potential limitation 
to their approach. 
Reply. We accept the comment and modified accordingly a paragraph of the discussion at page 16 
3. The approach used in their analysis would not identify patients being treated across various centres 
using common protocols. You cannot assume therefore that there is a direct correlation between 
access to optimal treatment and number of treatments per centre per year.  
Reply: we partly agree with, registries are not able to reach the information whether a patient is or not 
treated according to an agreed protocol, mainly because this information is rarely reported in the clinical 
record. What we would like to stress is that a high number of diagnosed and treated patients, can 
provide a sound expertise and help to a better application of agreed protocols. This is mainly true for 
complex surgery, but also for high technology radiotherapy or for general management of complex 
patients. However, we are not able to demonstrate that patients with rare cancers are more 
appropriately cured in high volume hospital. Our aim is to address the centralization issues and we 
hope that this is more clear in the reviewed discussion (page 16).  
 
4. Expertise and numerical activity may not be tightly related. The development of the total mesorectal 
excision for rectal cancer, pioneered at Basingstoke, is a good example of how a centre that is small - 
in terms of patients treated per annum - can innovate and generate outcomes that are superior to those 
achieved in busier centres. 
Reply: we recognise the brilliant example of mesorectal excision.  However, this exception  may be 
more applicable to a common cancer, like rectal cancer, for which a critical number of surgically treated 
cases can be reached by a small center.  
 
5. The attractant properties of specific technologies lead to increased localisation of services. It is 
 4 
 
therefore not surprising that thyroid cancer and sarcomas have higher mean admission volumes than 
would be expected from their incidence, as emerges from the rankings in table S1. The management of 
thyroid cancer requires specialist nuclear medicine facilities and the management of sarcoma is 
critically dependent upon advanced techniques both in surgery and in rehabilitation. 
Reply: We agree that for STS and thyroid specific technologies should lead to increased localisation of 
services. Actually, we observed higher MAV than expected for thyroid and for bone, but not for soft 
tissues sarcomas.(page 13). 
  
6. A recent paper from Korea (Shin DW, Cho J, Yang HK, Kim SY, Lee SH, Suh B, et al. Oncologist 
Perspectives on Rare Cancer Care: A Nationwide Survey. Cancer Res Treat. 2015;47(4):591-9) 
outlines oncologists' views of the problems they encounter in the management of rare tumours. It also 
hints at the potential difficulties that might arise when attempts are made to centralise services for 
patients with rare tumours.  
Reply: We  knew the interesting paper  reported by the reviewer; we are aware that centralization is 
sometimes not perceived as a the ideal solution therefore we include this point of view in the discussion 
(page17). We added a new reference.. 
 
Pathology and Registration 
 
7. The analysis relies on the pathology of up to 20 years ago, and may be of questionable relevance to 
future practice, which will be increasingly based on molecular and genomic classification. 
Reply: we included in the Discussion (Page 20) the point raised by the reviewer. 
 
8. The rise in incidence for gastrointestinal stromal tumours is probably an example of ascertainment 
bias. Once you start performing immune staining for mutant c-kit, then the incidence rises. The authors 
need to discuss the molecular and genetic phenotyping of individual tumours and how this will have an 
impact on the estimates of the incidence of rare tumours and how this might cause fragmentation of 
apparently homogeneous categories. The overall effect would be to decrease the number of patients 
per category. 
Reply: we completely agreed with the reviewer with the example of GIST. In this case the ICD-O 
included a new code and GIST started to be identified by cancer registries. Other new codes, because 
of  new tests, mainly for the haematologic group of neoplasms, were included in the ICD-O. In our 
proposed list, the new entities were not recognised as specific rare entities, because they were grouped 
with other rare entities sharing the same therapeutic approach and expertise, see the group of acute 
myeloid leukaemia. The statement included in the discussion (page 20 ) can answer the question 
raised by the reviewer. 
 
9. A flow diagram (or Venn diagram) indicating which registries contributed to which aspects of this 
study would have been very helpful.  
 5 
 
Reply: We do not think this request add more information that what was reported in the Material and 
Method section.  
 
10. I was unable to obtain access to the cited reference in Tumori (2017) but note that questions have 
been raised concerning the quality of data from registries in Eastern and Southern Europe (Rare 
Cancers Europe Survey 2012. 
Reply: We attach a pdf version of the Tumori paper, for reviewer’s consideration. We do not know the 
Rare Cancer Europe Survey 2012, but we don’t completely agree with this statement. The study, 
published in Tumori, included data also from Sweden, Ireland, Austria, Belgium, Netherlands, Austria, 
Switzerland and France and no major quality differences were found between registries from different 
European regions.   
 
Minor points 
 
11. A brief description of the Ederer-2 method would be helpful (the reference provided is unobtainable) 
Reply: we provide an alternative citation for relative survival estimation 
Ederer F, Axtell LM, Cutler SJ. The relative survival: a statistical methodology. Natl Cancer Inst Monogr 
1961; 6: 101–21. 
 
12. I'm not convinced that Kaposi's sarcoma should be included with the other sarcomas. It is a virally 
related tumour, it responds to highly active retroviral therapy and it is this factor that has probably had 
the main impact on improving survival from Kaposi's sarcoma. 
Reply: We agree. Actually, Kaposi's sarcoma did not contribute to the incidence and survival rates of 
sarcomas,. It is a separate rare entity.  
13. The sentence on page 13 "centralisation of epithelial ovarian cancers was not slow in Bulgaria and 
Slovenia" is a little difficult to understand. Perhaps it could be rewritten as "in Bulgaria and Slovenia the 
management of epithelial ovarian cancers was highly centralised." 
Reply:  Thanks. We have re written the sentence as suggested.  
 
14. On page 14 there is the statement "the drop in incidence for some of the rare cancers was due to 
the still falling prevalence of smoking". The reference given (16) is to smoking prevalence itself rather 
than to the effects of smoking on the incidence of rare cancers. 
Reply:  we provided a more precise reference, WHO, THE EUROPEAN TOBACCO CONTROL REPORT 
2007, http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/68117/E89842.pdf 
 
15. I did not have access to the figure captions: the use of a log scale for the X-axis in Figure 3 
deserves specific comment. 
 6 
 
Reply:  we added a comment at page 12 and of course we will pay attention to correctly include figure 
captions. 
 
16. Reference 27 in the text is reference 25 in the bibliography (there is no reference 27) 
Reply:  We corrected the reference  
 
17. P15 "like for incidence" - sentence needs rewriting 
Reply:  we rewrited the sentence   
Reviewer #3: First rate study. As a consequence I have little of substance to add. My comments are 
below. 
 
1. Table 2. I assume 95% confidence limits. 
 
2. Table 3. Lower and upper what? I assume 5-year survival is a percentage. 
Reply:  Following the standard practice in presenting funnel plot analysis with a large number of 
statistical units, confidence bound correspond to plus or minus three standard deviations from the zero 
change, corresponding to 99.8% confidence limits. We gave more details in titles of both Tables 2 and 
3 
 
3. Abstract. If space permits a sentence of what constitutes a rare cancer to be included. 
Reply:  we have included the information requested . 
 
4. Is death all-cause? 
Reply:  yes, relative survival analysis considers death for all causes, corrected by general population 
mortality rates to eliminate expected deaths not due to cancer (details in references 4 and 7).  
 
5. Given the quality of data there's no reason as to why sex-specific incidence (overall, not by country) 
couldn't be provided 
Reply: we accepted the suggestion and a Supplementary Table is attached 
 
6. Provide a STROBE Statement.  
Reply: we do not understand this point 
 
Final review: 
 7 
 
My overall comment is that the data are per se interesting, but not particularly new and add to a limited 
amount to what we know and what should be done. 
The part about management is purely ecological and any projections about what type/degree etc of 
centralisation of care is needed to achieve results remain speculative. Hospital volume is also a moving 
target and much has happened since 2007. 
Reply: as far as we know, cancer survival and incidence trends are rarely given. Furthermore, we think 
that our contribution answers to the increasing interest of the EC expressed by the Joint action on Rare 
Cancers and the ERN. Therefore, as stated, this ‘old’ picture will help the evaluation of activities on rare 
cancers at European and country level.

Summary: Your abstract should conform to the CONSORT guidelines for abstracts (CONSORT for Abstracts: Lancet 
2008; 371: 281-83), and must include: 
 
a) 
Background: A sentence indicating the aim of this study. 
b) 
Methods: A brief summary of the main patient characteristics (ie, main entry criteria) 
c) 
Interpretation: please do not just restate your findings. What do they mean, clinically? What are their 
implications? 
d) 
A line at the end of the abstract stating who funded the research.  
 
See recent issues of the journal for examples. At this stage, please do not worry about the word length of the 
abstract - accuracy and completeness here are essential.

If you have included such data for a drug(s), please confirm that the dose, route, and frequency of administration 
(and the form: eg, a particular salt) are correct. 
 
8. 
It is Lancet style to give actual numbers (numerator and denominator) together with percentages—eg, '5 (50%) of 10 
patients in the treatment group received treatment per protocol'. 
 
9. 
Please do not translate HRs/RRs/ORs into percentages, since this can be misleading. Simply indicate the 
HRs/ORs/RRs and let the reader interpret the data. 
 
10. 
Lancet style is to provide p values to 2 significant figures, unless p<0.0001 (if this is the case, then please revise to 
the latter).

Lancet style is to have a 'Role of the funding source' at the end of the methods. The following points need to be 
addressed in the "Role of the funding source" statement: 
 
a) 
The role of the sponsors in the study design. 
b) 
The role of the sponsors in the collection, analysis, or interpretation of the data. 
c) 
The role of the sponsors in the writing of the report. 
d) 
Those who had access to the raw data (by author initials).  
 
If the funding source had no role then this should be stated. Please also add to this section (if true): "The 
corresponding author had full access to all of the data and the final responsibility to submit for publication."

All abstracts and references in press should be updated with DOIs or page numbers as appropriate. For papers 
listed in references that are "in press" we need to see a galley proof and/or letter from the publisher stating that it is 
"in press" as well as (where known) the full expected citation (ie, publication date/volume/issue etc). References that 
are "submitted" should be removed and citations in the text replaced with "(unpublished data; authors)".

It is no longer TLO policy to include investigator lists in the main paper; instead, these will be published in the online 
appendix that is linked to the paper; investigators will still be indexed in PubMed.

It is no longer Lancet policy to edit or style supplementary material for the web; however, this material will still be 
hosted on our website as a pdf of the author supplied file. Please style your supplementary material as per the 
guidelines below. Please note that we will be unable to correct any errors in the webappendix following publication; 
as such, please check carefully when submitting.  
 
Please supply the webappendix as a single PDF file, with the pages paginated - when you refer to an item in the 
appendix, please refer to the page number on which it appears, not the table or section.
