approaches cost-effective? A systematic review of the
literature

Purpose:
We
conducted
a
systematic
literature
review
to
summarize the current health economic evidence for whole-
exome sequencing (WES) and whole-genome sequencing (WGS).
Methods: Relevant studies were identified in the EMBASE,
MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, EconLit and University of York
Centre for Reviews and Dissemination databases from January 2005
to July 2016. Publications were included in the review if they were
economic evaluations, cost studies, or outcome studies.
Results: Thirty-six studies met our inclusion criteria. These
publications investigated the use of WES and WGS in a variety of
genetic conditions in clinical practice, the most common being
neurological or neurodevelopmental disorders. Study sample size
varied from a single child to 2,000 patients. Cost estimates for a
single test ranged from $555 to $5,169 for WES and from $1,906 to
$24,810 for WGS. Few cost analyses presented data transparently
and many publications did not state which components were
included in cost estimates.
Conclusion: The current health economic evidence base to
support the more widespread use of WES and WGS in clinical
practice is very limited. Studies that carefully evaluate the costs,
effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness of these tests are urgently
needed to support their translation into clinical practice.

INTRODUCTION
The first human genome sequence was produced in 2003, and
its production cost between $500 million and $1 billion. For
many years, the cost of sequencing an entire genome
remained prohibitively expensive for routine use in clinical
practice, with an estimated cost of $20–25 million in 2006.1
However, since 2008, when next-generation sequencing
(NGS) approaches entered the research setting, there has
been
a
significant
decline
in
sequencing
costs.
These
approaches allow either the whole genome (via whole-
genome sequencing (WGS) or parts of it (via whole-exome
sequencing (WES) or targeted panels) to be sequenced faster,
at great depth and increasing sensitivity, and this decrease in
costs has made the clinical application of WES and WGS
more feasible.2 Conventional molecular testing of patients
with genetic disorders has hitherto relied primarily on single-
gene or panel testing or microarrays. However, estimates
suggest that up to 50% of patients fail to receive a molecular
diagnosis after such testing and embark on a diagnostic
odyssey which is both slow and costly for health-care
providers.3
Given this, several studies have investigated the benefits
arising from the application of WES and WGS in the clinic.
These studies have primarily focused on intellectual learning
disability4 or Mendelian conditions more broadly,3,5–9 con-
sistently reporting diagnostic yields between 25 and 30%. In
addition, WES and WGS have often informed prognoses or
treatment of patients, for example in inflammatory bowel
disease10 and epilepsies.4,9
Considerable evidence therefore exists that applying WES
or WGS in the clinic will improve the diagnosis and (in some
cases) treatment of genetic disease, which may improve
patient health outcomes and facilitate the more efficient use of
health-care resources. However, demand is increasing for
evidence on the incremental costs and health outcomes
associated with these technologies compared with those used
in current practice to support these assertions and to ensure
that these new technologies are not merely an expensive
add-on to patient care.2 Much of the recent demand for
evidence is driven by national sequencing programs such as
the Genomics England 100,000 Genomes Project and the
Genome Canada initiative. Before these programs were
launched, sequencing capacity was concentrated in individual
research or clinical laboratories that purchased their own
equipment and ran their own sequencing pipelines, buying
reagents as required. However, these national sequencing
initiatives have challenged suppliers to offer a turnkey service
to meet a volume requirement of whole genomes, and this has

machines optimized to sequence at scale. Despite the
substantial reductions in sequencing costs following these
developments, there is still little information available on the
costs of bioinformatics analysis and clinical interpretation
(and on what the costs of sequencing are, if not done at scale),
as documented in earlier literature reviews.11–13 It is therefore
important to understand what economic evaluation evidence
is currently available in the literature on clinical applications
of WES and WGS, and where there are gaps in the
evidence base.
This paper reports the results of a literature review that
summarizes the current evidence in the health-economic
literature on the use of WES and WGS in a clinical setting.
We highlight the areas where good evidence exists and the
areas characterized by a paucity of data, and we explore the
methodological and applied economic considerations asso-
ciated with the more widespread use of NGS approaches in
clinical practice in cancer, rare diseases, and pathogens.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The aim of this literature review was to summarize the current
health-economic evidence base for WES and WGS. The
review focused specifically on WES and WGS, as these are the
newest NGS technologies, with potentially the highest costs.
The main objective was to identify economic evaluations of
these technologies. Economic evaluation has been defined as
“the comparative analysis of alternative courses of action in
terms of both their costs and consequences,” and this
approach can be used to quantify and compare the costs
and outcomes of health-care interventions with a view to
identifying those that represent the best value for money.14
For the purposes of this review no restrictions were placed on
the comparisons made within these economic evaluations:
studies comparing WGS with WES were eligible for inclusion,
as were studies comparing these testing approaches against
other forms of testing, such as single-gene tests. This review
therefore also aimed to identify publications reporting data on
either the costs of WES or WGS testing pathways, or on
clinically relevant outcome measures for these tests. Publica-
tions reporting narrowly defined sequencing costs (e.g. cost
per megabase/run) that are not linked to specific clinical
applications were not included, as an earlier review sum-
marizes these costs for different sequencing platforms.13
Search strategies and study selection
Search strategies were designed for EMBASE, MEDLINE, the
Cochrane Library, EconLit, and the University of York Centre
for Reviews and Dissemination (CRD) Database. These
strategies included both index terms and free-text words
(see Supplementary Appendix S1 online). Key words were
identified by examining relevant references in the literature
and the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) used by EMBASE
and MEDLINE (http://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/). Table 1
describes the study selection criteria. Search strategies were
restricted to publications written in English or German (the
first author is a native German speaker) between January 2005
and July 2016. This date range reflects the novelty of the
sequencing
technologies
under
consideration:
older
publications either do not exist or would be outdated owing
to technological developments. No restrictions were placed on
study length as it was anticipated that relevant data might be
presented in conference abstracts.
The literature search was undertaken in July 2016 by K.S.
Following deduplication,
publications
were
scanned for
relevance
by
title
and
abstract,
and
clearly
irrelevant
publications were excluded. The full text of the remaining
publications was then evaluated for relevance by both K.S.
and S.W.. Any uncertainties were resolved in consultation
with J.B. The reference lists of retrieved publications and the
publications of recognized authors in this field were also
reviewed to identify additional studies that met the inclusion
criteria.
Data extraction
Relevant material was extracted from the included publica-
tions
using
a
bespoke
proforma
(see
Supplementary
Appendix S2). This proforma was initially piloted on three
publications. Following minor revisions, all publications were
then assessed using this proforma. The extracted data
included bibliographic details and information on the study
objective, disease context, patient population, and sequencing
methods. Information was also extracted on the study
perspective, assumptions, methods, outcomes, costs, main
results, and author-reported study limitations.
Classification of publications
Publications were categorized as economic evaluations, cost
studies, or outcome studies. Publications were defined as
economic evaluations only if data on both costs and outcomes
were presented for WES or WGS and a comparison with at
least one alternative testing option (which could be no testing)
was undertaken. Publications that only included data on the
costs of testing pathways or were budget-impact analyses,
were classified as cost studies. Publications that only included

 clinically relevant outcome data were classified as outcome
studies.
Publications were further categorized by type of economic
evaluation,
with
five
approaches
considered.
All
five
approaches measure health-care costs in monetary terms,
but they differ in the measurement of health outcomes. Two
of these approaches were classified as partial economic
evaluations. In cost-consequence analysis, costs and health
outcomes are reported separately, with multiple outcome
measures presented. This allows decision makers to combine
this information in different ways to inform health-care
resource-allocation decisions. In cost-minimization analysis,
it is assumed that health outcomes are identical for the
interventions under consideration and these alternatives are
therefore compared in terms of their relative costs.
The remaining three approaches were classified as full
economic evaluations. In cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA)
outcomes are measured in health-related terms using natural
units such as life-years gained. Cost-utility analysis (CUA)
uses quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) as an outcome
measure, and these combine information on longevity and
quality of life. In both CEA and CUA studies results are
expressed as ratios of incremental costs to incremental
outcomes and compared with a threshold incremental cost-
effectiveness ratio to determine whether an intervention is
cost-effective. Finally, in cost-benefit analysis (CBA), health
(and sometimes nonhealth) outcomes are valued in monetary
terms using approaches such as willingness-to-pay question-
naires and discrete choice experiments. CBAs may be more
informative for some genomic tests than CEAs or CUAs,
particularly when a test does not offer an obvious survival
benefit.15 CBA results are commonly expressed as a ratio of
costs to benefits, or as a sum representing the net benefit of
one intervention compared with another.
Data analysis
The data were summarized in several ways. Counts were
calculated for study characteristics including type of study and
form of economic evaluation and diagnostic yield estimates

 diagnose” cohorts were also highlighted. These studies either
explicitly stated that probands were difficult to diagnose or
focused on patients who had previously undergone multiple
unsuccessful diagnostic procedures. All cost estimates for
WES and WGS testing were extracted from the included
studies, including both costs and commercial prices. Where
the cost year was not stated, the latest date at which the
costing must have been conducted was used (e.g. date of
manuscript submission). Cost estimates were converted to
British pounds and US dollars based on purchasing-power
parities.16 Purchasing-power parities reflect the cost of
purchasing a standardized set of goods and services in
different countries and are subject to fewer fluctuations than
exchange rates. Costs were then inflated to 2016 values using a
UK health-care inflation index.17 Finally, minimum and
maximum
costs
were
calculated
for
each
sequencing
approach.
RESULTS
The database search identified 1,277 publications, of which
302 were duplicates (Figure 1). After titles and abstracts were
screened and full-text publications assessed for eligibility, 14
publications were identified that fulfilled the inclusion criteria.
A review of the reference lists of retrieved publications and
the publications of recognized authors in this field identified
22 additional relevant publications (7 of which were identified
after

2016,

Overall,
36
relevant
publications
were
identified.
Study characteristics
Table 2 summarizes the characteristics of these 36 publications.
Detailed

in
Supplementary
Appendix S3. The publications investigated the use of WES
and WGS in a variety of conditions with a genetic background.
The
most
common
conditions
were
neurological
or
neurodevelopmental disorders (7 publications), with 13 (36%)
publications investigating WES and WGS exclusively in
children or newborns. The study sample size varied from a
single child to a cohort of 2,000 patients.
The studies reported in the following nine publications
(22%) did not have a patient population. Bennette et al.22 used
a decision analytic model to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of
returning incidental findings from WES and WGS in the
United States. Buchanan-Hughes et al.23 constructed a
decision tree to calculate the cost utility of bacterial WGS in
the diagnostic pathway of urinary tract infections. Chrystoja
and Diamandis24 presented a discussion of the challenges and
opportunities associated with the use of WGS as a diagnostic
test. The report by the Foundation for Genomics and
Population Health25 described the costs of WES for colorectal
cancer in three UK National Health Service laboratories.
Plöthner et al.26 investigated the costs associated with
executing WGS in German clinical practice. Sabatini et al.27
conducted a bottom-up cost study of WES in Canada and
compared the findings with the costs of the traditional clinical
pathway for diagnosing neurodevelopmental disorders, using
payer cost-impact models. Van Nimwegen28 constructed a
decision model to examine the cost-effectiveness of WES in
clinical practice in the Netherlands. Finally, Tsiplova et al.20,21
calculated the cost-effectiveness of WES and WGS compared
with chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) in three
hypothetical testing scenarios.
Twenty-one economic evaluations were identified, of which
8 were full economic evaluations18–23,28–30 and 13 were partial
economic evaluations.3,31–42 Seven studies presented data on
the costs of WES or WGS testing pathways,24–27,43–45 and
eight studies presented data on clinically relevant outcome
measures for these tests.5,6,8–10,46–48 Of the eight full economic

 the cost-effectiveness threshold for WES in pediatric neuro-
developmental disorders by calculating the cost of the current
diagnostic pathway.
All 13 partial economic evaluations were cost-consequence
analyses. These studies were published between 2013 and
2016 in the Netherlands (4), Australia (3), Canada (2), France
(1), the United States (2) and the United Kingdom (1). Eleven
of these publications investigated WES, with the study by
Pankhurst et al.42 evaluating bacterial WGS and the study by
Shashi et al.3 evaluating several potential NGS approaches.
While all 13 publications reported cost estimates for WES or
WGS, only 3 stated the methods and sources underlying these
estimates.35,37,42
Of the seven studies that presented data on the costs of
WES or WGS testing pathways, four evaluated WGS.
Chrystoja and Diamandis24 reviewed the potential of WGS
and

et al.43 estimated the costs of WGS in the United States as well
as the costs associated with curation and clinical follow-up.
Weymann et al.45 estimated the costs of using WGS to inform
treatment decisions in patients with advanced cancers. Towne
et al.44 estimated the cost of using WES to achieve a diagnosis
in rare presentations in a pediatric population. The studies by
the Foundation for Genomics and Population Health,25
Sabatini et al.,27 and Plöthner et al.26 have been described
previously.
Eight studies, published between 2011 and 2016, presented
data on clinically relevant outcome measures for WES and
WGS. Seven of these studies investigated WES;5,6,8–10,46,47 the
eighth evaluated WGS.48 Four publications used the tradi-
tional care pathway in the investigated condition as a
comparator.6,10,46,48 Three publications were retrospective
analyses6,47,48 and three were diagnostic studies, estimating
the diagnostic yield of WES in a variety of conditions.5,8,9 The
final two studies were case studies on single probands and
families.10,46
Twenty-four (67%) of the publications that met the
inclusion criteria focused on WES, with five (14%) focusing
on WGS, five (14%) focusing on both WGS and WES, and
two (6%) evaluating bacterial WGS. The most common study
setting was the United States (36% of publications). The
earliest two studies were published in 2011, with all other
studies published between 2013 and 2017.
WES and WGS costs
Table 3 summarizes the cost estimates for NGS approaches,
with
detailed
information
provided
in
Supplementary
Appendix S4. Twenty-nine studies reported cost estimates,
of which 18 reported costs for WES. Estimates ranged from
£382 ($555)32 to £3,592 ($5,169)34,38 for a single WES test.
The highest estimate for a single test (£3,592) was based on
commercial prices. The highest estimate of the actual costs of
a single WES test (i.e. not commercial prices) was £1,808
($2,602).37 Cost estimates for a trio ranged from £2,658
($3,825)44 to £6,466 ($9,304).38 Thirteen publications stated
that costs were estimated within the study; nine of these
publications reported their costing approach.19–21,26–28,36,37,45
Many publications did not state which components were
included in the cost estimate. The costs for reagents ranged
from £291 ($420)35 to £1,171 ($1,685).31
Cost estimates varied little over time. The lowest estimate
for a single WES test was £736 ($1,060)44 in 2013 and £736
($1,070)28 in 2017. In terms of country-level costs, the lowest
estimate (£382; $555)32 was reported in an Australian study
from 2015, and the highest estimate (£3,592; $5,169)36,38 was
reported in two Canadian studies from 2014. There were no
regional differences: the lowest cost estimates in North
America (£736; $1,060)44 and the rest of the world (£382;
$555)32 were similar, but far less with the higher cost
estimates (£3,592; $5,169 in North America,36,38 £3,401;
$4,907 in the rest of the world).40,41
Six studies estimated the cost of WGS, four of which used
data from commercial sources.24,26,28,43 Cost estimates ranged
from £1,312 ($1,906) for sequencing using the HiSeq X in
Germany26 to £17,243 ($24,810) for an unspecified platform
in Canada.24 Four studies used a transparent bottom-up
approach to estimate the cost of WGS.20,21,26,28,45 There was
limited evidence of a reduction in the cost of WGS over time,
with the lowest estimate declining from £10,497 ($15,146)43 in
2013 to £1,312 ($1,906)26 in 2017. However, this is based on a
small sample. The two cost estimates for bacterial WGS were
considerably lower than those for WES or WGS in humans.
Finally, of the 16 studies that calculated test costs rather than
applying an assumed figure or using a commercial price, only
10 described the cost calculation in a transparent manner.
WES and WGS outcomes
A variety of outcomes were assessed in the publications that
met the inclusion criteria, including successful diagnoses,
diagnostic yield, sensitivity and specificity, quality-adjusted
life years (QALYs), time to diagnosis, change in clinical
management, acute clinical usefulness, mortality/survival,
parent satisfaction, frequencies of disease subtypes, mode of
inheritance, spectrum of genetic events, reporting of inciden-
tal findings, target capture, and prediction of bacterium
species and drug susceptibility. Diagnostic yield was the
most common outcome measure (18 publications). Table 4

 for WES (3%) was estimated in a patient group with colorectal
cancer.37 The highest rate for WES (79%) was reported for
individuals with childhood-onset muscle disorders.18 Around
a third of the included publications investigated WES or WGS
in a population group that was difficult to diagnose.
WES and WGS cost-effectiveness
Eight studies estimated the cost-effectiveness of WES or WGS.
Sagoo et al.30 estimated the cost-effectiveness of WES
compared with usual testing practice (genetic tests and
disease gene panel tests) in a variety of disease contexts.
When WES was introduced later in the testing pathway, the
incremental cost per additional positive diagnosis was £3,213
($4,670). When WES was used as a near first-line test the
incremental cost per additional positive diagnosis was £2,230
($3,242).
Van Nimwegen28 compared the costs and outcomes
associated with WES (using the HiSeq 4000) with those of
conventional diagnosis for pediatric neurological disorders
(which includes magnetic resonance imaging scans, electro-
encephalography, and muscle biopsies). In the author’s first
analysis, WES was treated as a last-resort test, with an
incremental cost per additional diagnosis of £8,319 ($12,092).
The second analysis treated WES as a first-line test, and in
many plausible scenarios this resulted in cost savings.
Soden et al.29 estimated that WES would be cost-effective in
pediatric
neurodevelopmental
disorders,
compared
with
existing nongenomic investigative approaches (including
laboratory tests, radiologic procedures, and electromyograms)
on a cost-per-diagnosis basis if the cost of WES was no more
than £2,123 ($3,063) per individual.
Schofield et al.18 reported that WES offered a cost saving
per diagnosis of £6,483 ($9,342) compared with traditional
investigations (muscle biopsy, histological and biochemical
analyses, Sanger sequencing) for the diagnosis of pediatric
muscle diseases.
Stark et al.19 examined the cost-effectiveness of three
scenarios for implementing WES as a routine clinical test
for infants with suspected monogenic disorders. Integrating
WES after standard investigations (including biochemical
investigations, imaging, and neurophysiological studies) cost
£3,830 ($5,518) per additional diagnosis, replacing a subset of
existing investigations with WES cost £1,238 ($1,784) per
additional diagnosis, and implementing WES as a first-line
test to replace most investigations saved £1,030 ($1,484) per
additional diagnosis.
Tsiplova et al.20,21 evaluated the cost-effectiveness of
strategies involving WES and WGS compared with CMA in
autism spectrum disorder. Adding WES to CMA cost £13,912
($20,046) per additional diagnosis, whereas implementing
WGS instead of CMA cost £32,219 ($46,424) per additional
diagnosis using a HiSeq 2500 sequencer, and £14,219
($20,488) using a HiSeq X sequencer. Implementing WGS
compared with a WES-plus-CMA approach cost £106,590
($153,587) per additional diagnosis using a HiSeq 2500
sequencer, and £15,464 ($22,283) using a HiSeq X sequencer.
Buchanan-Hughes et al.23 investigated the cost-effectiveness
of bacterial WGS to guide targeted antibiotic selection in
urinary tract infections, finding that bacterial WGS was more
expensive than methods employed in current clinical practice,
with poorer health outcomes.
Finally, Bennette et al.22 estimated the cost-effectiveness of
generating information on incidental findings using genomic
sequencing. The cost per QALY gained for cardiomyopathy
patients was estimated to be £32,187 ($46,313), for colorectal
cancer patients it was £82,623 ($118,883), and for healthy
individuals it was £42,102 ($60,578). Generating information
on incidental findings for cardiomyopathy patients and
healthy individuals was therefore cost-effective, compared
with a threshold of $100,000 per QALY gained.
DISCUSSION
This review summarizes the current health-economic evi-
dence base for WES and WGS. We found that the costs of a
single test ranged from £382 to £3,592 per patient for WES,
from £1,312 to £17,243 per patient for WGS in humans, and
from £40 to £487 for bacterial WGS. There was no evidence
that the cost of WES was falling over time, and only limited
evidence that the cost of WGS was decreasing, contrary to the
widely held belief that genomic sequencing costs are falling
rapidly in clinical settings. There were also few regional
differences in costs. The most commonly utilized outcome
measure was diagnostic yield, with few studies using outcome
measures recommended for use in economic evaluations, such
as survival or quality of life. Furthermore, in only a few
individual patients was the provision of an accurate molecular
diagnosis from WES/WGS followed through to the con-
comitant changes in clinical investigations and treatment,
where significant health-economic impact may be anticipated.
Most of the identified publications concluded that WES and
WGS were superior in economic terms to other testing
methods, but many of these analyses were based on small
patient
samples and only eight publications were full
economic evaluations. Of these eight publications, only five
produced evidence that WES or WGS may represent a cost-
effective use of limited health-care resources. As the cost-
effectiveness of WES and WGS is probably dependent on
clinical context, study timing, patient population, and other
health system factors, we are unable to make a broad
statement about the cost-effectiveness of these technologies.49
Overall, the results of this review indicate that the current
health-economic evidence base to support the more wide-
spread use of WES and WGS in clinical practice is very
limited.

Are WES and WGS cost-effective? | SCHWARZE et al
SYSTEMATIC REVIEW
GENETICS in MEDICINE | Volume 20 | Number 10 | October 2018

 The absence of economic evaluations of WES and WGS in
the literature was anticipated before this review was under-
taken, in light of the novelty of these technologies. We
therefore also identified publications reporting data on either
costs or clinically relevant outcome measures for WES and
WGS. Even when we broadened the scope of our review,
robust evidence that could inform health-care resource-
allocation
decisions
remained
scarce.
Few
publications
described how cost estimates were calculated or whether the
costing perspective was that of a health-care provider, or a
broader societal perspective. It was also unclear in many
studies what items included in the cost estimates represented
resource use. In many cases cost estimates either reflected
commercial prices or were hypothetical threshold costs at
which WES or WGS could become cost-effective; there were
few high-quality detailed microcosting studies. There was also
overlap between studies, with several applying cost estimates
from early studies to new clinical contexts. In terms of health
outcomes, around a third of the identified publications
investigated WES or WGS in “difficult-to-diagnose” popula-
tion groups that had previously undergone a variety of
unsuccessful diagnostic tests. Given this, it was difficult to
estimate an overall diagnostic yield for genomic sequencing,
as study results varied depending on the clinical context and
on whether probands were tested alone or as trios. Long-term
data on costs and health outcomes were particularly scarce.
Furthermore, publication dates ranged from 2011 to 2017. In
this rapidly evolving field of research, it is likely that some of
these cost
and health outcomes estimates
are already
outdated. Given this heterogeneity in methods and study
quality, we have not reported estimates of mean costs and
diagnostic yield: such measures would mask variations by
sequencing platform and clinical context and would be of
limited use in informing budgetary decisions regarding the
use of WES and WGS in health care. Overall, these findings
suggest that the cost, health-outcome, and cost-effectiveness
results presented in the identified papers are not generalizable
to different clinical and country settings, and are of limited
use in informing health-care resource-allocation decisions.
This is the first literature review that has summarized the
economic evidence in the literature related to the use of next-
generation genomic sequencing approaches such as WES and
WGS in clinical settings. However, this review has two key
limitations. First, over half of the included publications were
identified from other sources, which could indicate that the
search strategies were not sufficiently sensitive. A key
challenge when specifying the search strategies was that
sequencing
methods
and
health-economic
evidence
are
commonly misclassified in the literature. Broad search terms
were therefore combined to ensure that all forms of NGS and
all types of economic evidence were captured. Consequently,
this approach identified several studies that evaluated tests
other than WES or WGS, or that mentioned the potential
cost-effectiveness of genomic sequencing, but did not present
any evidence. This highlights the need for clear definitions
and methods for economic evaluations.
Second, the literature search did not specifically aim to
identify
clinical
outcomes,
focusing
only
on
outcome
measures typically used in economic evaluations (e.g. QALYs,
life years gained). However, studies including other outcome
measures were included if they were identified. This decision
was made because the inclusion of search terms such as
“successful diagnosis” would have resulted in a prohibitively
large increase in irrelevant papers. Publications similar to the
included outcome studies might therefore have been excluded
from this review. However, when the references of articles
summarizing outcome data were reviewed, the same sources
were cited in most cases. This suggests that key publications
in this field were not overlooked.
Given the pace of change in genomic research, there is
probably a lag between published health-economic data and
current practice in laboratories and hospitals. That said, the
data presented in this review provide a useful starting point to
explore the potential methodological and applied economic
considerations associated with the more widespread use of
NGS approaches in clinical practice. A key concern is the
paucity of studies utilizing those outcome measures that are
recommended for use in economic evaluations by major
health technology assessment agencies such as the National
Institute for Health and Care Excellence in the United
Kingdom and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Com-
mittee in Australia. Outcome measures such as life years or
QALYs are recommended by such institutions as this enables
comparisons to be made between interventions when health-
care resource-allocation decisions are being considered. The
widespread use of “diagnostic yield” as an outcome measure
in the studies identified in this review is therefore problematic
for health technology assessment agencies. In the short to
medium term, studies evaluating the effectiveness and cost-
effectiveness of WES and WGS could better inform the
allocation of health-care resources by presenting data on
health outcomes using metrics such as life years and QALYs.
Studies investigating the link between diagnostic yield and
patient survival and quality of life would also contribute to
this
literature.
In
the
longer
term,
health
technology
assessment agencies may wish to consider whether focusing
solely on health benefits is appropriate for interventions such
as WES and WGS. Although this is the correct focus when
resource-allocation decisions are being made with respect to a
national health-care budget, it is possible that important
nonhealth benefits arising from the use of WES and WGS
(such as the inherent value of diagnostic information) are not
captured when adopting this approach.15 Widening the
recommended perspective (often permitted when evaluating
public-health interventions) may therefore improve overall
population health and well-being.
A second concern is that most of the studies identified in this
review utilized small patient samples. Related to this, the
estimates of costs, health outcomes and cost-effectiveness
reported in these studies varied widely. This highlights the
importance in future studies of genomic sequencing of
collecting such data at scale, prospectively, with coverage of

 a diverse range of patient groups. Large national sequencing
initiatives such as the Genomics England 100,000 Genomes
Project are well placed to generate such estimates, providing
essential evidence to inform the translation of WES and WGS
into clinical practice. Research into the health economics of
NGS approaches should be a key component of such initiatives.
We have four additional practical recommendations. First,
few studies reported all of the cost components of the overall
cost of either WES or WGS. It was therefore difficult in many
cases to identify key cost drivers. Future studies should report
costs by stage of testing for WES and WGS and highlight
particularly notable costs. Second, resource use and unit costs
were often not reported in a disaggregated manner. Again,
this hinders interpretation and makes it difficult to identify
the cost components that researchers and commissioners
should focus on in order to reduce the cost of testing. Third,
several studies did not calculate the actual cost of WES or
WGS, instead using prices derived from commercial sources.
These prices do not necessarily reflect the economic value
associated with WES or WGS, and do not capture the
opportunity cost of using limited health-care resources to
implement genomic testing in routine clinical practice.
Economic evaluations that use such prices may therefore
recommend incorrect and inefficient adoption decisions.
Future studies evaluating the cost-effectiveness of WES or
WGS should use calculated costs instead of prices. Finally,
several studies did not include a health economist as an
author.
This
probably
contributed
to
heterogeneity
in
methods and study quality. Future studies of the cost-
effectiveness of WES and WGS should include trained health
economists as coinvestigators.
This review has demonstrated that the current health-
economic evidence base supporting the more widespread use
of WES and WGS in clinical practice is very limited. A key
consequence of this finding is that it is currently difficult for
health technology assessment agencies to efficiently allocate
scarce
health-care
resources
where
WES
and
WGS
approaches are concerned. Studies that carefully evaluate the
costs, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness of these interven-
tions in a transparent manner are urgently required, to enable
more informed decision making in this context.
