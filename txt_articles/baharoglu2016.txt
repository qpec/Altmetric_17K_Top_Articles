Summary
Background Platelet transfusion after acute spontaneous primary intracerebral haemorrhage in people taking 
antiplatelet therapy might reduce death or dependence by reducing the extent of the haemorrhage. We aimed to 
investigate whether platelet transfusion with standard care, compared with standard care alone, reduced death or 
dependence after intracerebral haemorrhage associated with antiplatelet therapy use.
Methods We did this multicentre, open-label, masked-endpoint, randomised trial at 60 hospitals in the 
Netherlands, UK, and France. We enrolled adults within 6 h of supratentorial intracerebral haemorrhage 
symptom onset if they had used antiplatelet therapy for at least 7 days beforehand and had a Glasgow Coma Scale 
score of at least 8. With use of a secure web-based system that concealed allocation and used biased coin 
randomisation, study collaborators randomly assigned participants (1:1; stratifi
 ed by hospital and type of 
antiplatelet therapy) to receive either standard care or standard care with platelet transfusion within 90 min of 
diagnostic brain imaging. Participants and local investigators giving interventions were not masked to treatment 
allocation, but allocation was concealed from outcome assessors and investigators analysing data. The primary 
outcome was shift towards death or dependence rated on the modifi
 ed Rankin Scale (mRS) at 3 months, and 
analysed by ordinal logistic regression, adjusted for stratifi
 cation variables and the Intracerebral Haemorrhage 
Score. The primary analysis was done in the intention-to-treat population and safety analyses were done in the 
intention-to-treat and as-treated populations. This trial is registered with the Netherlands Trial Register, number 
NTR1303, and is now closed.
Findings Between Feb 4, 2009, and Oct 8, 2015, 41 sites enrolled 190 participants. 97 participants were randomly 
assigned to platelet transfusion and 93 to standard care. The odds of death or dependence at 3 months were higher in 
the platelet transfusion group than in the standard care group (adjusted common odds ratio 2·05, 95% CI 1·18–3·56; 
p=0·0114). 40 (42%) participants who received platelet transfusion had a serious adverse event during their hospital 
stay, as did 28 (29%) who received standard care. 23 (24%) participants assigned to platelet transfusion and 16 (17%) 
assigned to standard care died during hospital stay.
Interpretation Platelet transfusion seems inferior to standard care for people taking antiplatelet therapy before 
intracerebral haemorrhage. Platelet transfusion cannot be recommended for this indication in clinical practice.

Introduction
Haemorrhagic stroke accounts for 11–22% of incident 
strokes,1 half of all stroke deaths, and around 42% of the 
disability-adjusted life-years lost due to stroke (47 million 
life-years).2 Spontaneous (non-traumatic) intracerebral 
haemorrhage caused by cerebral small vessel diseases 
accounts for two-thirds of haemorrhagic strokes,3 
amounting to more than 2 million incident intracerebral 
haemorrhages worldwide each year.
Antiplatelet therapy might slightly increase the incidence 
of intracerebral haemorrhage.4 In high-income countries, 
more than a quarter of people who have incident 
intracerebral haemorrhages were taking antiplatelet 
therapy.5 1 month case fatality after intracerebral 
haemorrhage is 40%, and people taking antiplatelet 
therapy beforehand have a 27% (95% CI 10–47) increased 
odds of death compared with those not taking 
antithrombotic drugs.6 Observational analyses suggest that 
antiplatelet therapy use before intracerebral haemorrhage 
and reduced platelet activity might worsen the outcome by 
increasing the risk of early intracerebral haemorrhage 
volume growth,7 which is an important determinant of 
outcome.8
Platelet transfusion is used prophylactically and 
therapeutically in many clinical settings; however, few 
randomised trials have investigated its eff
 ectiveness for

active bleeding disorders.9–11 Observational studies have 
reported variable associations with outcome after platelet 
transfusion for acute intracerebral haemorrhage in 
people taking antiplatelet therapy12–17 and the absence of 
randomised trials has prevented guidelines from 
recommending its use.10,11 However, platelet transfusion 
is commonly used in emergency departments, stroke 
units, and neurosurgical settings in people with acute 
intracerebral haemorrhage associated with antiplatelet 
therapy use.18 We did a randomised controlled trial of 
platelet transfusion in acute intracerebral haemorrhage 
associated with antiplatelet therapy use, aiming to assess 
whether platelet transfusion would reduce death or 
dependence compared to standard care by reducing 
intracerebral haemorrhage growth.
Methods
Study design and participants
We did a multicentre, randomised, open-label, parallel-
group trial at 36 hospitals in the Netherlands, 13 hospitals 
in the UK, and 11 hospitals in France. The trial was 
designed and coordinated by the Department of 
Neurology of the Academic Medical Centre (University of 
Amsterdam, Netherlands). The trial protocol has been 
published previously19 and case report forms are available 
on the trial website.
We included patients aged 18 years or older with non-
traumatic supratentorial intracerebral haemorrhage 
confi
 rmed by brain imaging and a Glasgow Coma Scale 
score of 8–15; in whom platelet transfusion could be 
initiated within 6 h of symptom onset (or last seen well) 
and within 90 min of brain imaging; who had been on 
antiplatelet therapy with a cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor 
(aspirin or carbasalate calcium), adenosine diphosphate 
(ADP) receptor inhibitor (clopidogrel), or an adenosine-
reuptake inhibitor (dipyridamole) for at least 7 days 
preceding intracerebral haemorrhage; and who had a pre-
intracerebral haemorrhage modifi
 ed Rankin Scale (mRS) 
score of 0 (no symptoms) or 1 (no signifi
 cant disability 
despite symptoms; able to carry out all usual duties and 
activities). Exclusion criteria were blood on brain imaging 
suggestive to the treating physician of epidural or 
subdural haematoma, or an underlying aneurysm or 
arteriovenous malformation; planned surgical evacuation 
of intracerebral haemorrhage within 24 h of admission; 
intraventricular blood more than sedimentation in the 
posterior horns of the lateral ventricles; previous adverse 
reaction to platelet transfusion; known use of vitamin K 
antagonist (unless international normalised ratio ≤1·3) or 
history of coagulopathy; known thrombocytopenia (lower 
than 100 cells × 10⁹/L); lacking mental capacity by national 
legal standards before intracerebral haemorrhage; or if 
death appeared imminent. We did not include participants 
with infratentorial or large intraventricular haematomas 
because they are more likely to undergo surgical 
procedures that might confound the eff
 ects of platelet 
transfusion on outcome. Collaborating clinicians on the 
delegation log at each hospital site recruited participants, 
and obtained written informed consent from participants 
or their legal representatives.
We obtained research ethics committee approval from 
the Academic Medical Centre ethics committee 
(MEC08/006) and each participating hospital in the 
Netherlands; the Scotland A Research Ethics Committee 
(10/MRE00/36) in the UK; and the Comité de protection 
des personnes (CPP 12/43, 2012-A00209–34) in France. 
The trial was monitored by the Clinical Research Unit of 
the Academic Medical Centre in the Netherlands, the 
Clinical Research Unit of the Lille University Hospital in 
France, and the UK trial manager on behalf of The 
Academic and Clinical Central Offi
  ce for Research and 
Development in the UK.

Research in context
Systematic review
Before we initiated the PATCH trial in 2009, a search of 
ClinicalTrials.gov and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled 
Trials (CENTRAL) did not reveal published, ongoing, or planned 
randomised trials of platelet transfusion for acute intracerebral 
haemorrhage in people taking antiplatelet therapy. On 
April 1, 2016, we searched MEDLINE (PubMed) from Jan 1, 1950, 
Embase from Jan 1, 1947; ClinicalTrials.gov, and CENTRAL from 
Jan 1, 1993, using textwords for platelet transfusion (“platelet” 
OR “blood platelet” OR “thrombocyte”) and the textword 
“transfusion” and terms for intracerebral haemorrhage and 
randomised trials, as well as bibliographies of relevant 
publications, for trials of platelet transfusion for acute 
intracerebral haemorrhage in people taking antiplatelet therapy, 
irrespective of language of publication. We found one ongoing 
randomised trial (NCT00699621) and one published randomised 
trial dissimilar to PATCH of platelet transfusion versus aspirin 
resumption for aspirin-sensitive people with acute basal ganglia 
intracerebral haemorrhage undergoing craniotomy. 
Added value of this study
This is the only completed randomised trial of people taking 
antiplatelet therapy who have acute intracerebral haemorrhage 
to compare the eff
 ects of platelet transfusion with standard 
care on functional outcome. Platelet transfusion seemed 
inferior to standard care for reducing death or dependence after 
acute intracerebral haemorrhage in people taking antiplatelet 
therapy. 
Interpretation of all the available evidence
Platelet transfusion seems inferior to standard care after acute 
intracerebral haemorrhage in people taking antiplatelet therapy. 
We cannot recommend platelet transfusion for this indication, 
pending the results of another similar randomised trial.

Randomisation and masking
Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive 
either standard care or platelet transfusion plus standard 
care. Randomisation was done by investigators via a 
secure, web-based, computerised randomisation system 
(TENALEA, Clinical Trial Data Management system; 
NKIAVL, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) that concealed 
allocation, and stratifi
 ed assignment by study hospital and 
type of pre-intracerebral haemorrhage antiplatelet therapy 
(COX inhibitor alone, ADP receptor inhibitor alone, COX 
inhibitor with an adenosine-reuptake inhibitor, or COX 
inhibitor with an ADP receptor inhibitor). A biased coin 
randomisation was used, with coin bias factor of three and 
coin bias threshold of two. Participants and local 
investigators giving interventions were not masked to 
treatment allocation, but allocation was concealed to 
outcome assessors and investigators analysing data.
Procedures
The web-based randomisation system asked investigators 
to check eligibility criteria and required investigators to 
record participant age and type of pre-intracerebral 
haemorrhage antiplatelet therapy. Investigators recorded 
all other characteristics at the time of enrolment. Stroke 
severity was scored on the National Institutes of Health 
Stroke Scale (NIHSS, ranging 0–42, with higher scores 
indicating more severe stroke). Brain imaging was done 
at admission with either CT or MRI according to routine 
clinical practice.
All participants received standard care, which was not 
defi
 ned in the protocol but was assumed to be given 
according to contemporary European20 and national 
guidelines. Leucocyte-depleted platelet transfusions, either 
buff
 ycoat-derived or collected by apheresis, were supplied 
by national or regional blood supply organisations, issued 
by the hospital transfusion laboratory, and administered to 
participants in the transfusion group according to local 
hospital protocols for transfusion. The protocol required 
platelet transfusion to be initiated within 6 h of intracerebral 
haemorrhage symptom onset and within 90 min of 
diagnostic brain imaging. Participants taking a COX 
inhibitor, with or without adenosine-reuptake inhibitor, 
received one platelet concentrate (equivalent to fi
 ve donor 
units), whereas participants taking an ADP receptor 
inhibitor, with or without another antiplatelet drug, received 
two platelet concentrates. We chose the diff
 erent dosages of 
platelet concentrates based on in-vitro experiments.21 
Investigators recorded whether platelet transfusion started 
within 3 h or 3–6 h after symptom onset.
Functional outcome scored with the mRS at 3 months 
(ranging from 0 [no symptoms] to 6 [death]) was rated by 
a neurologist or research nurse who was not involved in 
participants’ medical treatment. Each country’s trial 
coordinating centre organised collection of the primary 
outcome so that it could be obtained in participants’ fi
 rst 
language by either structured telephone interview or 
face-to-face consultation.
Brain imaging was done at 24 h (plus or minus 3 h) 
after randomisation with the same technique used for 
diagnosis. Diagnostic and 24 h brain imaging studies 
were obtained in Digital Imaging and Communications 
in Medicine (DICOM) format from trial sites, 
anonymised, and analysed centrally in Amsterdam. The 
images were assessed for intracerebral haemorrhage 
location (deep or lobar) and intraventricular extension. 
We used an automated planimetric method to segment 
intracerebral haemorrhage on unenhanced baseline 
imaging22 to calculate intracerebral haemorrhage volume 
in mL; these measurements were manually checked by 
MIB who was masked to treatment allocation and 
supervised by one of two independent neuroradiologists 
(CBM or LFB; not involved in the conduct of the trial and 
masked to allocation); values were adjusted where 
necessary.
Investigators recorded the occurrence of any serious 
adverse events and other safety outcomes that occurred 
during hospital admission, and also recorded the date 
and destination of discharge. Safety outcomes were 
independently verifi
 ed by research nurses, or the safety 
committee in France, with use of discharge letters.
Data on paper case report forms were collected at the 
trial coordinating centre in each country (Amsterdam, 
Netherlands; Edinburgh, UK; and Lille, France). Good 
Clinical Practice-compliant internet-based remote data 
capture was used for entering, managing, and validating 
data from hospital sites (Oracle Clinical, ORACLE, 
Redwood Shores, CA, USA.

Outcomes
The primary endpoint was diff
 erence in functional 
outcome at 3 months after randomisation scored with 
the mRS. Secondary clinical outcomes at 3 months were 
survival (mRS score of 1–5), poor outcome defi
 ned as an 
mRS score of 4–6, and poor outcome defi
 ned as an 
mRS score of 3–6. The secondary explanatory outcome 
was median absolute intracerebral haemorrhage growth 
in mL after 24 h on brain imaging. Safety outcomes were 
defi
 ned as complications of platelet transfusion 
(transfusion reactions, thrombotic complications) and 
for other serious adverse events the treating physician 
was asked to specify the presumed cause as one of the 
following: due to complications of intracerebral 
haemorrhage (enlargement, intra 
ventricular extension, 
hydrocephalus, oedema, or brain herniation), epileptic 
seizures, infection (urinary tract or pneumonia), or 
others that investigators wished to record. We planned a 
substudy of the spot sign on CT angiography and platelet 
function testing. We also planned to investigate 
determinants of poor outcome, functional outcome 
using the Academic Medical Center (AMC) Linear 
Disability score, and health economics.
Statistical analysis
The executive committee agreed on a statistical analysis 
plan with the trial statistician (RJdH) without knowledge 
of outcome data and before closing and unmasking the 
trial database; this statistical analysis plan was submitted 
in concise format to the Netherlands Trial Register on 
March 14, 2016, was submitted in full to Trials on 
March 21, 2016, and the trial database was locked and 
unmasked on March 31, 2016. The statistical analysis 
plan describes the diff
 erences between the protocol and 
this fi
 nal report; the principal change was from a fi
 xed 
dichotomous analysis of the primary outcome (mRS 
score 4–6 at 3 months) to an ordinal logistic regression 
analysis of the shift of all categories of the mRS at 
3 months, in view of the greater statistical effi
  ciency of 
this analysis23 and the hypothesised eff
 ect of platelet 
transfusion to result in a shift on a functional outcome 
scale by reduction of intracerebral haemorrhage growth. 
We originally based the target sample size of two groups 
of 95 participants (total 190) on an estimate of 70% 
frequency of the primary outcome of death or dependence 
(defi
 ned as mRS 4–6) with standard care,24 a clinically 
important 20% absolute reduction of this risk to 50% 
with platelet transfusion (odds ratio [OR] 0·43), 80% 
power and a two-sided level of signifi
 cance of 0·05. 
However, after the change (and with the same target 
sample size), power increases to 91% to detect a common 
OR of 0·43 in an ordinal logistic regression analysis of all 
pairs of mRS categories, assuming a distribution of the 
mRS with standard care that is similar to the control 
group of a recent intracerebral haemorrhage trial.25 
The primary outcome was the shift of each category 
in the entire range of the mRS, assuming a common 
OR analysed by ordinal logistic regression (with 
adjustment for both the stratifi
 cation variable of type of 
pre-intracerebral haemorrhage antiplatelet therapy as 
well as the Intracerebral Haemorrhage Score as a

in the intention-to-treat population. Eff
 ect sizes are 
expressed as ORs with 95% CIs. Baseline characteristics 
and secondary endpoints were assessed in the 
intention-to-treat population with no imputation for 
missing data. Secondary outcomes were compared with 
the χ² test, except for the median diff
 erence in 
intracerebral 
haemorrhage 
growth, 
which 
was 
compared with the Mann-Whitney U test. Safety 
outcomes were compared in both the intention-to-treat 
and the as-treated populations. We used parametric 
statistics when variables had a normal distribution, and 
non-parametric statistics when they did not. If zero 
instances were reported, we added 0·5 to each cell to 
calculate an OR.
We did three prespecifi
 ed subgroup analyses of the 
shift of all categories of the mRS using ordinal regression 
analyses to test the interaction variable, adjusted for both 
component variables, for type of antiplatelet therapy 
regimen pre-intracerebral haemorrhage (single vs dual); 
country of randomisation (Netherlands vs France vs UK); 
and trichotomised intracerebral haemorrhage volume at 
baseline (≤7 mL vs >7 to 30 mL vs >30 mL) to search for 
eff
 ects in small, medium, and large intracerebral 
haemorrhages. We did a sensitivity analysis of the eff
 ect 
of platelet transfusion on the primary outcome at 
hospitals that included at least fi
 ve participants in which 
we also adjusted for including centre.
Analyses were done using IBM SPSS statistics version 
22 (Cleveland, OH, USA). An independent data 
monitoring committee (appendix) oversaw the trial and 
agreed with the termination of the trial when it reached 
its prespecifi
 ed sample size in Oct 8, 2015. A separate 
committee monitored the safety of participants enrolled 
in France (appendix). The trial is registered with the 
Netherlands Trial Register, number NTR1303.

Results
Between Feb 4, 2009, and Oct 8, 2015, 41 sites enrolled 
190 participants (fi
 gure 1). 97 participants were randomly 
assigned to receive standard care with platelet transfusion 
(platelet transfusion group) and 93 were assigned to 
standard care without transfusion (standard care group). 
No participants were lost to follow-up at 3 months and all 
were included in the fi
 nal analyses after the last follow-
up was completed on Jan 6, 2016.
Baseline characteristics were balanced between groups 
(table 1), apart from peripheral arterial disease, which was 
not considered of major prognostic relevance to the 
primary outcome. 36 (19%) participants had at least one 
exclusion criterion, 15 (15%) in the platelet transfusion 
group (12 had intraventricular haemorrhage, two had 
infratentorial localisation of haematoma, and one was not 
using antiplatelet therapy) and 21 (23%) in the standard 
care group (20 had intraventricular haemorrhage and one 
had thrombocytopenia). Baseline imaging was missing 
for centralised reading for two participants and 
intracerebral haemorrhage volume or intraventricular 
extension could not be measured for fi
 ve participants 
because images were degraded by movement artifact.
Four participants assigned to platelet transfusion did 
not receive it, and two participants assigned to standard

care received a platelet transfusion (fi
 gure 1). Four 
protocol violations occurred in the platelet transfusion 
group (two participants did not receive the correct 
number of platelet concentrates and two received platelet 
transfusion out of the prespecifi
 ed time window). Follow-
up imaging at 24 h was missing for 17 participants in the 
platelet transfusion group (three omitted, fi
 ve died, four 
imaged >27 h, and fi
 ve poor quality) and for 20 participants 
in the control group (nine omitted, four died, two imaged 
>27 h, and fi
 ve poor quality).
For the primary outcome, odds of a shift towards death 
or dependence at 3 months were higher in the platelet 
transfusion group than in standard care group without 
adjustment (crude common OR 1·84, 95% CI 1·10–3·08; 
p=0·0200) and with adjustment (adjusted common 
OR 2·05, 95% CI 1·18–3·56; p=0·0114; fi
 gure 2). In 
secondary analysis, more participants in the platelet 
transfusion group had poor outcome with an mRS score 
of 4–6 at 3 months than did those in the standard care 
group (table 2). Survival and the proportion of participants 
with an mRS score of 3–6 at 3 months did not signifi
 cantly 
diff
 er between groups; nor did intracerebral haemorrhage 
growth at 24 h (table 2). The distribution of the mRS was 
similar in participants who received platelet transfusion 
within 3 h of symptom onset versus those who received 
transfusion at 3–6 h (appendix).
40 (42%) participants who received platelet transfusion 
had a serious adverse event, as did 28 (29%) who received 
standard care (as-treated population; table 3). Most 
serious adverse events were intracerebral haemorrhage 
enlargement or urinary or pulmonary infections. One 
participant had a minor transfusion reaction. 24 (25%) 
participants assigned to platelet transfusion and 15 (16%) 
assigned to standard care died while in hospital. In an 
analysis of the as-treated population, most adverse events 
did not diff
 er by group assignment. Serious adverse 
events due to intracerebral haemorrhage were higher in 
participants who received platelet transfusion than in 
those who received standard care (table 3). There was not 
a signifi
 cant diff
 erence between groups in serious 
adverse events due to thromboembolism, but four people 
in the transfusion group had an event versus one in the 
standard therapy group. Safety outcomes in the intention-
to-treat population did not diff
 er between groups.

had no signifi
 cant interaction with the eff
 ect of platelet 
transfusion versus standard care (fi
 gure 3). Platelet 
transfusion remained inferior to standard care in our 
sensitivity analysis restricted to hospitals that included at 
least fi
 ve participants (n=125; 66%) when the primary 
outcome was also adjusted for the hospital that included 
participants (adjusted OR 2·55, 95% CI 1·24–5·24, 
p=0·0107). In post-hoc analyses, the primary outcome 
remained unchanged when adjusted for intracerebral 
haemorrhage volume at baseline (adjusted common 
OR 1·90, 95% CI 1·08–3·36, p=0·0268) and after 
excluding the 36 participants who met at least one 
exclusion criterion (adjusted OR 2·22, 95% CI 1·20–4·09, 
p=0·0108). Due to insuffi
  cient uptake in standard clinical 
practice we did not perform the planned sub-studies of 
the spot sign on CT angiography and platelet function 
testing. We did not investigate causes of poor outcome, 
functional outcome using the AMC Linear Disability 
score, or health economics due to insuffi
  cient funding.
Discussion
Our randomised trial of nearly 200 participants shows 
that platelet transfusion seems to increase the risk of 
death or dependence in participants who have an acute 
intracerebral haemorrhage while taking antiplatelet 
therapy. This eff
 ect was consistent in predefi
 ned 
subgroups and remained after adjustment for pre-
intracerebral haemorrhage antiplatelet therapy and 
known prognostic factors. These surprising fi
 ndings are 
contrary to our hypothesis that platelet transfusion would 
reduce intracerebral haemorrhage growth and improve 
functional outcome, and are not consistent with small 
observational studies that have found better outcomes 
associated with the use of platelet transfusion.12–14
PATCH is the fi
 rst randomised trial to investigate the 
eff
 ects of platelet transfusion on acute intracerebral 
haemorrhage after the use of antiplatelet therapy, and is 
one of few randomised trials to investigate the eff
 ect of 
platelet transfusion on active bleeding disorders.9–11,16,17 In 
this multicentre trial, the eff
 ect of platelet transfusion on 
the primary outcome was consistent in three European 
countries, supporting the external validity of the trial 
(although its generalisability to low-income and middle-
income 
countries 
is 
unknown). 
The 
baseline 
characteristics and outcomes of the included participants 
were similar to previous randomised trials for acute 
intracerebral haemorrhage.25 Adherence to the assigned 
treatment was good and clinical follow-up for the primary 
outcome was complete (fi
 gure 1). The trial also achieved 
its target sample size.
However, the trial has some limitations. The sample 
size was smaller than in other acute stroke trials, 
refl
 ecting the lower incidence of acute stroke due to 
intracerebral haemorrhage, its clinical severity,5 and the 
demanding eligibility criteria we used.27 This small 
sample size resulted in some chance imbalances in 
baseline prognostic variables, although their direction of 
eff
 ect was not consistent—ie, some of these imbalances 
might have biased the platelet transfusion group to a 
worse outcome and others might have biased it to a 
better outcome (table 1). Our fi
 ndings could not be easily 
explained by chance imbalances in baseline char-
acteristics, although residual confounding due to 
randomisation imbalances is possible, especially in light 
of the small sample size. Most of the participants had 
taken aspirin and relatively few had taken ADP inhibitors, 
so it is unknown whether the fi
 ndings are generalisable 
to the increasing numbers of people who take ADP 
inhibitors. PATCH investigators were not required to 
keep screening logs, so the level of bias through selective 
inclusion is unknown. Furthermore, adherence to 
antiplatelet therapy for participants was not measured 
and we relied on information supplied by the participants, 
caregivers, or medical charts. Too few hospitals were able 
to test for platelet function to investigate whether 
function had modifi
 ed treatment eff
 ect, as had been 
suggested by one observational study.14 As is often the 
case in pragmatic trials in emergency settings, a fi
 fth of 
participants (36 [19%]) met at least one exclusion 
criterion.27 In particular, participants with intraventricular 
extension greater than sedimentation in the posterior 
horns of the lateral ventricles were included, possibly 
refl
 ecting diffi
  culty in interpretation of this criterion by 
clinicians. Because this protocol deviation was not 
equally distributed between treatment groups, we did a 
post-hoc sensitivity analysis excluding these participants, 
in which the fi
 ndings for the primary outcome remained 
consistent.
Our fi
 ndings contrast with the hypothesised mechanism 
of action of platelet transfusion. We did not fi
 nd a clear 
mechanism to explain our fi
 ndings among the reported 
safety outcomes (table 3), although there was a non-
signifi
 cant diff
 erence in serious adverse events due to 
thromboembolism and complications of intracerebral

haemorrhage were more common in the platelet 
transfusion group. Although conjecture, it remains 
possible that some participants actually had haemorrhagic 
transformation of infarction rather than intracerebral 
haemorrhage, or it is possible collateral perfusion around 
the intracerebral haemorrhage was impaired, resulting in 
cerebral ischaemia. Platelet transfusion could then 
increase the risk of thrombosis and result in lesion 
expansion. In a large observational study, people with 
thrombotic and prothrombotic disorders such as 
thrombotic thrombo 
cytopenic purpura and heparin-
induced 
thrombo 
cytopenia 
who 
received 
platelet 
transfusions had increased mortality and myocardial 
infarction compared with those people who were not 
transfused.28 Furthermore, platelets have proinfl
 ammatory 
eff
 ects and transfusions might 
enhance 
vascular 
permeability associated with infl
 ammation and platelet 
consumption. Platelets can also be activated when stored, 
resulting in increased prothrombotic and infl
 ammatory 
properties.29 It is also possible that platelet transfusion 
might not be benefi
 cial because the absolute increase in 
intracerebral 
haemorrhage 
growth 
associated 
with 
antiplatelet therapy is not large enough to be meaningfully 
modifi
 ed by platelet transfusion, or that platelet transfusion 
is insuffi
  cient to reverse the eff
 ects of antiplatelet therapy 
on intracerebral haemorrhage growth. Most eff
 ective 
platelet transfusions are given for prophylaxis of bleeding, 
often in severe hypoproliferative thrombo 
cytopenia in 
haematology-oncology participants.30 The eff
 ect of platelet 
transfusions to stop or reverse ongoing bleeding might be 
benefi
 cial or deleterious depending on the nature and 
location of the haemorrhage. These potential eff
 ects, 
combined with some baseline imbalances, could explain 
the detrimental eff
 ect of platelet transfusion in our trial. 
However, even if platelet transfusion was not harmful, our 
fi
 ndings suggest that it is unlikely to be benefi
 cial.
After the fi
 ndings of the PATCH trial, platelet 
transfusion cannot be recommended for the treatment of 
acute intracerebral haemorrhage in people taking 
antiplatelet therapy because platelet transfusion seemed 
to worsen their outcome. A similar randomised trial is 
nearing completion (NCT00699621), and its results are 
needed to confi
 rm our fi
 ndings in acute intracerebral 
haemorrhage. Given the widespread use of platelet 
transfusion for other acute bleeding disorder despite a 
shortage of randomised evidence, our fi
 ndings should 
lead to further trials so that this potentially hazardous 
and costly intervention is only used for prophylactic or 
therapeutic indications when supported by evidence 
from randomised controlled trials.
