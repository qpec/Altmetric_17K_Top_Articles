H
igh blood pressure is a major risk factor for global disease 
burden.1 Even modest reductions in blood pressure are 
important and would reduce the risk of associated morbidity 
and premature mortality.2–4 In settings where health care and 
medicines are freely available, a substantial burden of cardio-
vascular disease may be attributable to suboptimal adherence 
to blood pressure–lowering treatments.5 Missed appointments 
for collection of medicine and challenges with taking life-
long treatment are some of the major reasons for suboptimal 
Background—We assessed the effect of automated treatment adherence support delivered via mobile phone short message 
system (SMS) text messages on blood pressure.
Methods and Results—In this pragmatic, single-blind, 3-arm, randomized trial (SMS-Text Adherence Support [StAR]) 
undertaken in South Africa, patients treated for high blood pressure were randomly allocated in a 1:1:1 ratio to information 
only, interactive SMS text messaging, or usual care. The primary outcome was change in systolic blood pressure at 12 
months from baseline measured with a validated oscillometric device. All trial staff were masked to treatment allocation. 
Analyses were intention to treat. Between June 26, 2012, and November 23, 2012, 1372 participants were randomized 
to receive information-only SMS text messages (n=457), interactive SMS text messages (n=458), or usual care (n=457). 
Primary outcome data were available for 1256 participants (92%). At 12 months, the mean adjusted change in systolic 
blood pressure compared with usual care was −2.2 mm Hg (95% confidence interval, −4.4 to −0.04) with information-
only SMS and −1.6 mm Hg (95% confidence interval, −3.7 to 0.6) with interactive SMS. Odds ratios for the proportion of 
participants with a blood pressure <140/90 mm Hg were 1.42 (95% confidence interval, 1.03–1.95) for information-only 
messaging and 1.41 (95% confidence interval, 1.02–1.95) for interactive messaging compared with usual care.
Conclusions—In this randomized trial of an automated adherence support program delivered by SMS text message in a 
general outpatient population of adults with high blood pressure, we found a small reduction in systolic blood pressure 
control compared with usual care at 12 months. There was no evidence that an interactive intervention increased this 
effect.

adherence.6 Adherence support delivered via short message 
system (SMS) text messages has the potential to improve treat-
ment adherence and health outcomes.7 Some but not all inter-
ventions delivered by SMS have been effective at improving 
adherence and clinical outcomes, for example, in HIV-infected 
patients in low-resource settings.8 However, there is no evi-
dence that SMS-based interventions are effective in improv-
ing treatment adherence and clinical outcomes for high blood 
pressure in low-resource settings.9 We carried out an effective-
ness trial (SMS-Text Adherence Support [StAR]) to establish 
whether adherence support delivered via SMS text messages 
through information-only or interactive SMS text messaging is 
better than usual care in maintaining and improving treatment 
adherence and blood pressure control.
Methods
Study Design and Participants
We carried out a parallel, 3-group, randomized, controlled trial among 
the general adult population attending the outpatient chronic disease 
services in a single, large, public-sector clinic in Cape Town, South 
Africa. This primary care facility provides a range of healthcare ser-
vices to an ethnically diverse, socioeconomically deprived population 
from 2 communities. According to 2011 Census data, the ethnicity of 
these communities is mostly black African (51%) or mixed ancestry 
(48%), about one third of households live in informal dwellings or 
shacks, and 64% of households have a monthly income of less than 
R3500.00 (about $270.00). The clinic is within walking distance of 
both communities. All primary healthcare services and medicines 
are provided free of charge. In the chronic disease services, stable 
patients on treatment are reviewed by a clinician (doctor or prescrib-
ing nurse) every 3 to 6 months, although patients initiating treatment 
for the first time or those with a blood pressure >140/90 mm Hg are 
reviewed more frequently.
At clinical review, patients are prescribed medication on repeat 
until their next scheduled review. The medications available for first-
line prescription are enalapril, thiazide diuretic, and amlodipine. 
If blood pressure remains uncontrolled, then β- or α-blockers and 
occasionally spironolactone are added. Medicines are dispensed for 
28-day periods, and patients collect these from the onsite pharmacy. 
Patients on a stable regimen with a valid repeat prescription receive 
their monthly supply of medicines prepackaged from the Chronic 
Dispensing Unit, a centralized service through which the supplies are 
delivered to the clinic pharmacy 48 hours before a patient’s scheduled 
collection date. Medicines not collected are returned to the Chronic 
Dispensing Unit 72 hours after the scheduled appointment. The trial 
protocol, including an outline of the statistical analysis plan, has pre-
viously been published.10
We enrolled adults (≥21 years of age) who had the following 
characteristics: diagnosed with hypertension by a clinician using 
local guidelines, prescribed blood pressure–lowering medication, and 
with a systolic blood pressure (SBP) <220 mm Hg and a diastolic 
blood pressure <120 mm Hg at enrollment. Eligible patients were 
attending the primary care clinic, resided in 1 of the 2 study com-
munities, and had regular access to a mobile phone (and were able 
to send SMS text messages or could do so with help of a relative). 
We enrolled only 1 member per household. The following patients 
were excluded: those requiring specialist care for their hypertension 
at a hospital (in secondary care), women who self-reported being 
pregnant or within 3 months postpartum, and those with very high 
blood pressures (SBP >220 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure >120 
mm Hg) who had symptoms suggestive of a hypertensive emergency 
or were otherwise acutely unwell (who were directly referred to the 
appropriate clinical service).
Clinic staff who measured the vital signs of all patients attending 
the chronic disease services for a clinical review identified potential 
participants. Trained research assistants assessed trial eligibility for 
patients who had agreed to be referred to the trial, and those eligible 
were enrolled. Participants received an SMS text message at the time 
of recruitment to confirm their enrollment in the trial. All partici-
pants were subsequently sent non–health-related messages at 6-week 
intervals.
The trial was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee 
of the University of Cape Town (HREC UCT 418/2011), the Oxford 
Tropical Research Ethics Committee (OXTREC 03–12), and the 
Metro District Health Services, Western Cape (RP 141/2011). Trial 
conduct was overseen by a trial steering committee. All participants 
provided written informed consent, and the trial was conducted in 
accordance with the Helsinki Declaration of 2008.
Randomization and Masking
Trained research staff collected baseline data immediately before 
enrollment, and an independent administrator entered these data into 
a secure, Web-based randomization database implemented by the 
Primary Care Clinical Trials Unit in Oxford. A software algorithm 
assigned participants independently of the research team to informa-
tion-only adherence support, interactive adherence support, or usual 
care in a 1:1:1 ratio using a nondeterministic minimization algorithm 
to ensure balance between groups with respect to age, sex, baseline 
SBP, years with hypertension, and recent clinic attendance.11 Trial 
statisticians, researchers, clinic staff, and research assistants who col-
lected outcome data were masked to allocated interventions until the 
trial database was locked. Researchers and clinicians were not aware 
of randomization assignment, were trained not to ask patients about 
the content of messages, and were unable to determine randomization 
group from casual comments by participants. Blood pressure mea-
surements were automated, and data were captured directly to the 
trial database.
Procedures
All participants received written information about hypertension 
and healthy living and continued to receive care from the clinic. 
Personalized SMS text messages were sent to information-only mes-
sage and interactive message group participants at weekly intervals 
at a time and in a language selected by the participant. We iteratively 
designed, developed, and tested 2 SMS text messaging–based inter-
ventions with clinical staff and patients with high blood pressure 
working and living in low-income communities around Cape Town.12 
The messages were designed to address a range of common issues 
with adherence to and persistence with treatment.13 We developed 
a library of SMS text messages, which we mapped to a taxonomy 
of behavior change techniques (Table I in the online-only Data 
Supplement).14 Most of the messages focused on the techniques of 
goals and planning, repetition and substitution, social support, and 
natural consequences. The SMS text messages used in the interven-
tions were developed, translated, and tested in English, isiXhosa, and 
Afrikaans, the 3 languages most commonly spoken by people living 
in Cape Town.
The information-only adherence support group members were 
sent messages to motivate collecting and taking medicines and to 
provide education about hypertension and its treatment. Additional 
reminders were sent when medicines were ready for collection or 
for scheduled clinic appointments. All trial participants were given a 
phone number to contact the research team.
Participants allocated to the interactive adherence support 
received the same messages as the information-only group but could 
also respond to selected messages using free-to-user “please call me” 
requests. These generated an automated series of responses from the 
text message delivery system offering trial participants a number of 
options, including canceling or changing an appointment and chang-
ing the timing and language of the text messages.
All trial materials, including information sheets, consent forms, 
and the SMS text messages, were also developed, translated, and 
tested in English, isiXhosa, and Afrikaans.
All SMS text messages were delivered automatically via an open-
source Web-based electronic medical record system (OpenMRS ver-
sion 1.6.1, OpenMRS Ltd, Grandville, MI). All participant data were 
Downloaded from http://ahajournals.org by on June 4, 2019

captured in the clinic and uploaded to OpenMRS with Sana Mobile 
(Sana, MIT, Cambridge, MA), an open-source Android platform.10,15 
Timing of messages relating to clinic appointments and medicine 
collection was facilitated by secure linkage to computerized appoint-
ment data.
Messages were sent for 1 year from enrollment. Blood pressure 
measurements were collected from participants as they attended their 
routine clinic visits, but otherwise no additional measurements or 
interventions were carried out during the trial. Delivery of SMS text 
messages was automatically tracked, and if a message was undeliv-
ered, a research assistant blinded to group allocation contacted the 
number of a friend or relative to obtain a new mobile phone number. 
Table II in the online-only Data Supplement provides a structured 
description of the intervention and its development.16
The primary clinical outcome was the change in mean SBP 
measured at baseline and 12 months with a validated oscillometric 
device,10 adapted to record 6 sequential readings at 3-minute inter-
vals. The mean blood pressure was calculated by discarding the initial 
reading and calculating the mean from the 5 remaining readings.17
Treatment adherence was assessed by calculating the proportion 
of days of medication covered, a proxy measure of adherence, from 
prescribing and dispensing data routinely recorded in the clinical 
record, pharmacy record, and Chronic Dispensing Unit record.18,19 
When there were discrepancies in data on dispensing, we used a 
computer-based algorithm blinded to randomized group to assign the 
status (dispensed/not dispensed) favoring any evidence that the medi-
cation had been dispensed. Proportion of days of medication covered 
was summarized as the proportion of patients with ≥80% of days 
covered with blood pressure–lowering medication on the basis of a 
systematic review providing evidence for the clinical importance of 
this threshold5 and reported in 3-month intervals and over 12 months.
Additional secondary outcomes measured at 12 months, specified 
in the protocol,10 were proportion of participants achieving a mean 
SBP <140 mm Hg and a mean diastolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg, 
health status measured with the EuroQol Group 5-Dimension Self-
Report Questionnaire,20 proportion of scheduled clinic appointments 
attended, retention in clinical care, satisfaction with clinic services 
and care, hospital admissions, self-reported adherence to medication 
(score range, 5–10),21 and basic hypertension knowledge.22 Data were 
also collected on the number and type of medication changes made 
during the trial and numbers of clinic visits by participants.
Statistical Analysis
The intended target sample size of 1215 participants, allowing 20% 
loss to follow-up (at least 405 in each group), was estimated to detect 
an absolute mean difference in SBP of 5 mm Hg (SD, 22 mm Hg; a 
clinically important reduction in the relative risk of stroke and coro-
nary heart disease events)23 at 12 months from baseline, with 90% 
power and 0.05 (2-sided) level of significance. All analyses were per-
formed on an intention-to-treat basis.
We analyzed the 12-month primary outcome using a mixed-effect 
model for repeated measures including data available on all random-
ized patients attending follow-up visits at 6 and 12 months. The 
method has the advantage of implicitly accounting for the mecha-
nism of data missing at random by using maximum likelihood. In 
the model, participant-specific intercepts were fitted with the use of 
random effects, and time and treatment were modeled with the use 
of fixed effects. An interaction term between time and randomized 
group was also included so that possible differences in treatment 
effect (informational versus usual care and interactive versus usual 
care) could be assessed at each time point. The model was adjusted 
for baseline SBP and minimization factors.
Blood pressure thresholds were analyzed with mixed-effect logis-
tic regression models, and treatment adherence was analyzed with 
multiple logistic regression. Secondary outcomes involving categori-
cal data were analyzed by use of χ2 tests and generalized linear mod-
els adjusted for minimization factors. Other continuous secondary 
outcomes were analyzed with ANCOVA or nonparametric methods if 
the normality assumption was not satisfied. A statistical test of inter-
action was done to assess whether treatment effect was consistent 
across the prespecified subgroups of SBP (<140 or ≥140 mm Hg), age 
(<55 or ≥55 years), sex (male or female), number of years with hyper-
tension (<10 or ≥10 years), presence of ≥1 comorbid conditions, and 
self-reported adherence at baseline (<80% or ≥80%).24
A detailed statistical analysis plan was completed before the trial 
database was locked (to prevent any further changes before analysis), 
and the trial allocation was disclosed.25 A statistical analysis report 
was prepared in line with Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trial 
(CONSORT) 2010 statements. No interim analysis was performed.
The content of the information-only and the interactive adherence 
support interventions was examined in the preparatory work for the 
trial (see the expanded Methods in the online-only Data Supplement 
for further details). The 2 interventions were considered to be distinct 
treatments and therefore did not require adjustment for multiple com-
parisons.26–28 All statistical tests were 2 sided, and values of P≤0.05 
were considered to indicate statistical significance.26 Statistical analy-
ses were performed with STATA version 13.1 (StataCorp LP, College 
Station, TX) and SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
The trial was registered with the South African National Clinical 
Trials Register (SANCTR DOH-27-1212-386) before recruitment 
began. This registration was subsequently incorporated within the 
Pan African Trial Register (PACTR201411000724141), and we regis-
tered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02019823) at the time of publish-
ing the protocol to ensure that details were widely available.
Results
Patients
Between June 26, 2012, and November 23, 2012, we 
assessed 2558 patients for eligibility, of whom 1372 were 
randomly allocated to information-only SMS text messages 
(n=457), interactive SMS text messages (n=458), and usual 
care (n=457). Figure 1 summarizes recruitment and follow-
up of participants. Attrition rates did not differ significantly 
between groups, and those randomized were broadly similar 
to those screened but not randomized, although more were 
black (Table III in the online-only Data Supplement).
Table 1 summarizes the baseline characteristics of partici-
pants. Mean age was 54.3 years (SD, 11.5 years), and 28% had 
at least 10 years of hypertension. More than half of the patients 
had a body mass index of at least 30 kg/m2. Other baseline 
characteristics were similar across the 3 groups. Nearly all the 
participants owned their own phone (Table IV in the online-
only Data Supplement). Overall, 176 patients (12.8%) did not 
have an SBP measurement at 12 months. Not having SBP data 
at 12 months was associated with being female (P=0.03), hav-
ing a body mass index <30 kg/m2 (P=0.002), or having hyper-
tension for <10 years at enrollment (P=0.002). We sent 40 333 
SMS text messages to participants in the information-only 
message group, 41 450 to those in the interactive message 
group, and 8277 to those receiving usual care. Of the mes-
sages sent, 5.5% had a “failed delivery” response. In addition, 
3477 messages were not sent as planned because of techni-
cal errors. A total of 230 participants (50.2%) allocated to the 
interactive adherence support group responded to a message 
at some point in the trial; in total, 630 reply messages were 
sent by participants. There were 1231 visits by participants in 
the interactive group, 1109 by those in the information-only 
group, and 1093 by participants in the usual care group. One 
additional blood pressure–lowering medication was started 
by 44% of trial participants, and for this group, the median 
number of changes made was 2 (quartiles 1 and 3, 1 and 3). 
There were no differences between groups in the proportion of

patients having medication changes (usual care, 43.6%; infor-
mation only, 46.8%; and interactive, 44.0%).
Primary Outcome
Primary outcome data were available for 1256 participants 
(92%). Table 2 summarizes change in mean SBP, which 
decreased from baseline to 12 months for all groups. The 
mean adjusted difference in change for the information-only 
message group compared with the usual care group was −2.2 
mm Hg (95% confidence interval [CI], −4.4 to −0.04, P=0.046) 
and for the interactive message group compared with the usual 
care group was −1.6 mm Hg (95% CI, −3.7 to 0.6, P=0.16). 
A post hoc sensitivity analysis was carried out, excluding the 
6-month measure of SBP and including body mass index as a 
covariate. Results were consistent with the prespecified pri-
mary intention-to-treat analysis (Table V in the online-only 
Data Supplement).
Secondary Outcomes
The adjusted odds ratios for participants achieving a con-
trolled blood pressure defined as a blood pressure <140/90 
mm Hg at 12 months were 1.4 (95% CI, 1.0–1.9; P=0.04) and 
Figure 1. Trial profile. BP indicates blood pressure; and SMS, short message system.

1.4 (95% CI, 1.0–1.9; P=0.04) for information-only messages 
and interactive messages, respectively, compared with usual 
care (Table 3).
Adherence data were available for 1157 participants 
(86%). The overall number of participants who had at least 
80% of proportion of days of medication covered for blood 
pressure–lowering medication for the 12-month period was 
248 (62.8%) for the information-only message group, 225 
(59.7%) for the interactive message group, and 190 (49.4%) for 
the usual care group (informative messages versus usual care, 
P<0.001; interactive messages versus usual care, P=0.002; 
Table 3). The adjusted odds ratio for improved availability of 
dispensed medicine was 1.86 (95% CI, 1.39–2.49; P<0.0001) 
for information-only messaging compared with usual care and 
1.60 (95% CI, 1.20–2.16; P=0.002) for interactive messaging 
compared with usual care.
EuroQol Group 5-Dimension Self-Report Questionnaire 
scores, attendance at clinic appointments, retention in clinical 
care, treatment and clinic satisfaction, hypertension knowl-
edge, self-reported adherence, hospital admissions, and dif-
ferences in medication changes did not differ between groups 
(Table 3).
Seventeen patients died (usual care group, n=3; infor-
mation-only messages group, n=7; and interactive messages 
group, n=7) during the 12-month follow-up, but we recorded 
no other serious events (Table VI in the online-only Data 
Supplement).
Subgroup Analysis of Primary Data
Figure 2 shows the results of prespecified subgroup analysis of 
the primary outcome (SBP). There was no statistically signifi-
cant heterogeneity in the treatment effects, and there was an 
indication that active interventions were more effective among 
older patients (≥55 years of age), patients in better control at 
baseline (<140 mm Hg), and among those with a shorter dura-
tion of hypertension (<10 years).
Discussion
Summary of Trial Findings
This trial provides evidence that support delivered via SMS 
text messages could improve the collection of medicines and 
may have a small impact on blood pressure compared with 
usual care in a general outpatient population of adults with 
high blood pressure. There was no evidence of differences in 
intervention effectiveness between men and women, younger 
and older patients, and patients with and without comorbid 
conditions.
Strengths and Limitations
This randomized trial of a behavioral intervention delivered 
via SMS text message was carried out in a low-resource set-
ting and was designed to test for the impact of the intervention 
on prespecified measurable intermediate variables that are 
linked to important clinical outcomes.29–31
We prepared a detailed statistical analysis plan and speci-
fied in advance adjustment by covariates to ensure transparent 
analysis procedures.25 We have provided detailed descriptions 
of the intervention and its delivery, in line with recent report-
ing guidelines,16 that will enable comparison with other SMS 
text messaging–based systems and support development of 
new interventions.
The system for delivering the text messages was innova-
tive, combining low-cost technology, open-source software, 
and interoperability with external data sources, including 
the Department of Health of the Western Cape appointment 
data.
The trial had a number of limitations inherent in its design.

regular follow-up at the clinic may have reduced some supply-
side barriers to nonadherence, although up to half the partici-
pants were not collecting regular treatment. The trial was not 
powered to identify the observed difference in SBP observed 
between groups, although our sample size calculation was 
based on the effect sizes found in published trials of other 
behavioral interventions to support adherence to treatments 
for high blood pressure.32 In addition, the measure of adher-
ence used reflects only dispensing in the clinic, not the act of 
taking medication.
Targeting a group of people diagnosed with hyperten-
sion rather than those with a diagnosis of poorly controlled 
pressure may have also limited the extent to which improve-
ments in blood pressure were possible. However, we could 
not reliably predict those with poor control as a result of poor 
adherence, nor could we identify when nonadherence might 
take place in a previously adherent patient. Our decision not to 
target nonadherent patients was informed by formative work 
in which we identified the possibility that nonadherence could 
start at any time and by patient feedback that SMS messages 
targeted at people who were nonadherent might reduce their 
acceptability.
Comparisons With Other Literature
This is the first study to report a small impact on objectively 
measured blood pressure using support via text messaging 
without additional blood pressure monitoring33 and without 
healthcare providers contacting nonadherent patients.30 We 
found no evidence that an interactive intervention delivered 
with the same frequency as an information-only intervention

had a greater effect on adherence or blood pressure, in contrast 
to findings from other mobile phone–based interventions.34,35 
This might be explained by the older average age of partici-
pants in this trial compared with other mobile phone–based 
studies and could indicate either an age-based or experience-
based difference in how people make use of such technology.
Both trial interventions in StAR were delivered with simi-
lar fidelity to the trial protocol. Slightly more SMS text mes-
sages were sent in the interactive intervention group compared 
with the information-only group because of a small number of 
additional follow-up messages. Fifty percent of participants 
allocated to the interactive intervention responded, whereas 
in comparison, 38.5% of participants in a smoking cessation 
trial sent unprompted SMS texts requesting support.36 In a trial 
of weekly interactive SMS text messages to support treatment 
adherence among HIV-infected people initiating antiretroviral 
treatment, 68% of participants responded, with nonresponders 
receiving a phone call from a healthcare worker.8
The effect size observed on SBP was smaller than antici-
pated, particularly because the impact on treatment adherence 
was similar to that reported by others.9,35 However, those taking 
additional medication and achieving a lower blood pressure 
through better adherence may have been only a small propor-
tion of participants. A smaller standard deviation for SBP, the 
greater follow-up of participants than anticipated, and the use 
of a mixed model for analysis all may have contributed to the 
detection of a difference smaller than originally anticipated.
Results from a recent systematic review of interventions 
delivered via SMS text message to support adherence to anti-
retroviral therapy suggest that the dose-response relation-
ship for SMS text message frequency, if it exists, may not be 
linear, although counterintuitively, daily SMS text messages 
were less effective than weekly messages.35 More research is 
needed to identify the optimal frequency for SMS text mes-
sages to support treatment adherence.
The decrease in blood pressure observed in all participants 
at 6 months may be attributable to seasonal variation in blood 
pressure.37 However, this finding should be interpreted with 
caution because 6-month data were intended to supplement the 
multilevel modeling of the primary outcome when available 
and were collected for only a small proportion of participants.
Clinical Interpretation and Research Implications
High blood pressure is the leading risk factor for global dis-
ease burden, and even modest reductions in blood pressure 
are important and would reduce the risk of associated morbid-
ity and premature mortality.1,2 Although availability of medi-
cines and access to care remain important structural barriers 
to adherence in settings where health care and medicines are 
freely available (including many low- and middle-income 
countries such as South Africa), a substantial burden of car-
diovascular disease may be attributable to suboptimal adher-
ence to blood pressure–lowering treatments.
The difference in blood pressure observed in this trial was 
similar to that of intensive face-to-face behavioral counsel-
ing in which a 1–mm Hg difference between intervention and 
control was observed,38 and the difference in adherence was 
similar to other adherence support interventions delivered 
via SMS text messages.39,40 Pooled results from a systematic 
review of the literature suggest that the relative risk of devel-
opment of cardiovascular disease for those with good versus 
poor (<80%) adherence to blood pressure–lowering medica-
tion is 0.81 (95% CI, 0.76–0.86) and for all-cause mortality 
is 0.71 (95% CI, 0.64–0.78) with an estimated absolute risk 
difference for any cardiovascular disease associated with poor 
medication adherence of 13 cases per 100 000 individuals

per year.5 Although not reported here, we think that the costs 
of delivering messages via an automated SMS text mes-
sages at scale are likely to be low compared with commu-
nity based face-to-face interventions or training programs for 
clinicians.8,41,42
Conclusions
This trial has demonstrated that a behavioral intervention to 
support adherence to blood pressure treatment delivered via 
SMS text message can improve adherence and may modestly 
decrease blood pressure at 12 months. The delivery of pre-
defined messages can be achieved by an automated system 
consistently and without the need for additional training pro-
grams for clinical staff. The optimal frequency of the different 
categories of text messages; the incremental costs of modi-
fying messages so that they remain effective; and the wider 
implementation of these messages in different communities, 
for different long-term conditions, and for patients with mul-
tiple conditions need further study.

CLINICAL PERSPECTIvE
There is some evidence that clinical outcomes for the treatment of long-term conditions can be improved through interven-
tions targeting adherence behavior. This has been achieved in a small number of clinical trials for people with high blood 
pressure, but successful strategies can be costly, for example, through case management and pharmacy-based education. 
These approaches may not be practical in a low-resource setting. Some studies report that mobile phone messaging interven-
tions may offer benefit through supporting self-management and have potential to support lifestyle change, for example, in 
supporting smoking cessation. However, randomized trials of the effectiveness of mobile phone messaging in the manage-
ment of people with high blood pressure are few, often focused on high-risk groups such as stroke survivors and renal trans-
plant recipients, with only 1 small trial in the general population. This randomized, clinical trial is the first to show that there 
may be a modest benefit from improved adherence to medication regimens and reduction in blood pressure compared with 
usual care from a targeted mobile phone messaging intervention used to support people treated for high blood pressure. In 
addition, this intervention was delivered in a setting where providing health care is challenging. The extent of blood pressure 
lowering is similar to that observed in other community studies aimed at improving blood pressure management. Delivering 
an automated behavioral intervention to people treated for high blood pressure via mobile phones is acceptable to recipients 
and can be carried out at a wide scale.
