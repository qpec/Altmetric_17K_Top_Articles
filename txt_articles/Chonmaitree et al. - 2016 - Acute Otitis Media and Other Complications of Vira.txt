abstract
BACKGROUND: Viral upper and lower respiratory tract infections (URI, LRI) are common in 
infants. We determined the prevalence of viral URI and its complications, including acute 
otitis media (AOM) and LRI, and assessed the effect of bacterial-viral interactions, and 
genetic and environmental risks on AOM development.
METHODS: Healthy infants were enrolled from near birth and followed to the first episode 
of AOM up to 12 months of age. Nasopharyngeal specimens were collected at monthly 
intervals (months 1–6, 9) and during viral URI episodes for bacterial culture and viral 
polymerase chain reaction studies. Subjects were followed closely for AOM development.
RESULTS: A total of 367 infants were followed for 286 child-years; 887 URI (305 infants) and 
180 AOM episodes (143 infants) were documented. Prevalence of URI, LRI, and AOM in the 
first year was 3.2, 0.25, and 0.67 per child-year, respectively. Cumulative AOM incidence by 
ages 3, 6, and 12 months was 6%, 23%, and 46%. Infants with and without AOM had 4.7 and 
2.3 URI episodes per child-year, respectively (P < .002). Pathogenic bacterial colonization 
rates by month were significantly higher in infants with AOM (P < .005). Breastfeeding 
reduced both URI and AOM risks (P < .05). Significant bacterial-viral interactions occurred 
with Moraxella catarrhalis and a variety of respiratory viruses and altered URI and AOM 
risks.
CONCLUSIONS: Almost half of infants experienced AOM by age 1. Important AOM risk factors 
included frequent viral URI, pathogenic bacterial colonization, and lack of breastfeeding. 
Bacterial-viral interactions may play a significant role in AOM pathogenesis and deserve 
further investigation.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Viral upper 
respiratory tract infection is often complicated by 
bacterial infections. Medical progress has been made 
in the past few decades in pediatric vaccination and 
viral diagnostics. Birth cohort studies on respiratory 
infections mostly came from outside the United 
States.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Updated prevalence 
of upper respiratory tract infection, acute otitis 
media, and lower respiratory tract infection in 
American infants in the pneumococcal conjugate 
vaccine era. New information on the dynamics of 
pathogenic bacterial colonization, viral and bacterial 
interactions, and acute otitis media risk factors.

Viral and bacterial infections of the 
respiratory tract are important causes 
of morbidity in the first year of life. 
Infants are colonized with pathogenic 
bacteria from the first few months 
and are continuously exposed to 
respiratory viruses.1–5 Evidence to 
date suggests that viruses and bacteria 
interact, leading to upper and lower 
respiratory tract infections (URIs and 
LRIs, respectively).6–9 Although LRI is 
often associated with hospitalization 
and high morbidity in young infants, 
it is less prevalent than URI, which is 
exceedingly common and often leads 
to bacterial complications, such as 
acute bacterial sinusitis and acute 
otitis media (AOM).10, 
11
AOM is one of the most common 
childhood infections, the leading 
cause of visits to doctors by children, 
and the most common reason 
children consume antibiotics or 
undergo surgery. Development of 
AOM early in life increases the risk 
for recurrent or chronic AOM later.12, 
13 
Preventive efforts in the past decades 
may have led to reduction in AOM 
incidence. These include the advent 
of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines 
(PCV)14, 
15 and routine use of influenza 
vaccines in infants and children, 
16 
declining smoking rates, 
17 and 
increasing breastfeeding rates.18 Data 
on incidence of otitis media (OM) 
and socioeconomic impact of OM are 
derived from earlier studies.12, 
19, 
20 It is 
important to have contemporary data 
on the incidence and impact of OM.
The purpose of this study was to 
determine the incidence of viral URI 
and its complications in the first 
year of life in a healthy, prospective 
birth cohort and to assess the effect 
of bacterial-viral interactions, and 
genetic and environmental risks on 
the development of AOM.
METHODS
Study Design
This was a prospective, longitudinal 
study performed between October 
2008 and March 2014.21 The study 
was approved by the University of 
Texas Medical Branch Institutional 
Review Board. Healthy infants were 
recruited at age <1 month from 
the newborn nursery or primary 
care pediatric clinics at University 
of Texas Medical Branch. Excluded 
were infants with preterm birth, 
major medical problems, or anatomic 
defects. Before enrollment, subjects 
were prescreened for polymorphisms 
of tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα−308) 
and interleukin-6 (IL-6−174) 
genes, which we previously found 
associated with AOM susceptibility.22, 
23 The plan was to recruit equal 
numbers of infants with TNF−308 
polymorphism and wild type, 
but the matching attempt was 
discontinued because of the effects 
of Hurricane Ike (September 2008) 
on displacement and reduction of the 
Galveston population.
Subjects were followed to the first 
AOM episode or at least 6 months; 
subjects without AOM were followed 
to age 12 months. Data collected 
at enrollment and at each contact 
included the following: family 
history of AOM, number of siblings, 
day care attendance, cigarette 
smoke exposure, and breast versus 
formula feeding. Study personnel 
visited the homes monthly to collect 
nasopharyngeal swabs at months 
1 to 6 and 9. Parents notified the 
study team for each URI: nasal 
congestion, rhinorrhea, cough, and/
or sore throat, with or without 
constitutional symptoms such 
as fever, decreased appetite, and 
restless sleep. At URI onset, and 
3 to 5 days later, the subject was 
seen by the study physician; time 
and travel were compensated. The 
investigator performed otoscopic 
examination and tympanometry, 
and nasopharyngeal specimens 
were collected for microbiological 
studies. Study personnel called 
parents weekly for 4 weeks after 
URI onset to assess for possible AOM 
symptoms. Parents were encouraged 
to bring the subject for examination 
whenever they suspected the 
infant might have an ear infection. 
Investigators trained in otoscopy (TC, 
JP, or DM) made the AOM diagnosis 
based on acute symptoms (eg, 
fever, irritability, otalgia), signs of 
tympanic membrane inflammation 
(intense redness, bulging, opaque 
tympanic membrane), and presence 
of middle ear fluid as documented 
by pneumatic otoscopy and/or 
tympanometry. Video-otoscopy 
was attempted in all cases. AOM 
complicating URI was defined as 
AOM that occurred within 28 days 
of URI onset, 
24, 
25 unless a new URI 
occurred during this period, in which 
case AOM was a complication of the 
most recent URI. LRI was defined 
as a lower respiratory tract illness 
preceded by URI.
Study personnel called the parents 
twice monthly to identify missed 
URI, AOM, or LRI episodes. At subject 
discharge, the electronic medical 
record was reviewed for any missed 
URI, AOM, or LRI.
Nasopharyngeal swab specimens 
were tested for bacteria by culture, 
and for viruses by polymerase chain 
reaction, as previously described.21 
Polymerase chain reaction assays 
detected 13 respiratory viruses, 
including adenovirus; bocavirus; 
coronaviruses 229E, NL63, 
and OC43; enterovirus; human 
metapneumovirus (MPV); influenza A 
and B; parainfluenza viruses 1 and 3; 
respiratory syncytial virus (RSV); and 
rhinovirus (RV).
Statistics
The rate of bacterial colonization 
between AOM and no-AOM groups 
was compared by using linear trend 
in the logistic model. The effect of 
colonization on presence of AOM was 
estimated by using a mixed model 
with month and AOM status as factors 
along with an interaction effect; 
subject was a random intercept effect. 
The number of URIs was compared 
between subjects with and without

AOM by using a standard Poisson 
model. Because the encounters for 
determining URI as well as viral and 
bacterial presence were not uniform 
or lasted the same amount of time, 
a multivariate recurring events Cox 
proportional hazards model was used 
to compare the incidences of URI and 
AOM by viral or bacterial copresence; 
the subject was considered a random 
effect. A similar multivariate hazards 
model was used to assess the effect 
of static or changing environmental 
factors as well as genotype. Statistical 
3
significance was declared with 
P < .05. All calculations and models 
were run in R (cran.r-project.org), 
using add-on libraries such as 
survival and mgcv.
RESULTS
A total of 367 subjects were enrolled 
and followed; of these, 311 (85%) 
completed the study and 56 (15%) 
were lost to follow-up. Twenty-
one percent of subjects were 
followed for 6 months, 14% until 
the first AOM episode between 
age 6 and 12 months, and 65% for 
12 months. Characteristics of the 
subjects, follow-up duration, and 
the number of URI episodes and 
complications are shown in Table 1. 
Environmental factor data are shown 
in Supplemental Table 7.
URI and Complications
Of 887 URI episodes (305 infants), 
the investigators saw 413 (48%); 
the remaining were documented 
by phone or medical record review. 
Table 2 summarizes details regarding 
age and cumulative incidence of the 
first URI, AOM, and LRI. Subjects 
experienced between 1 and 9 URI 
episodes (mean = 3); URI prevalence 
was 3.7 and 3.2 per child-year in the 
first 6 and 12 months, respectively.
Sinusitis or LRI occurring within 28 
days of URI onset were considered 
URI complications. Sinusitis was 
diagnosed only clinically (mostly 
by nonstudy physicians), based 
on persistence and/or severity of 
symptoms. Clinical sinusitis was 
recorded after 41 URI episodes in 
37 subjects (4.6% of URI episodes). 
Because of the uncertainty in the 
diagnosis of sinusitis in this age 
group, no further details on sinusitis 
are reported.
There were 66 LRI episodes (51 
subjects) that occurred after URI; 
the rate of LRI complicating URI 
was 7.6%. The age at the first LRI 
diagnosis is shown in Table 2; the LRI

diagnoses are shown in Supplemental 
Table 8. The prevalence of LRI in the 
first 6 and 12 months of life was 0.25 
and 0.24 per child-year, respectively.
AOM Incidence and Prevalence
Overall, 143 infants (46%) 
experienced 180 AOM episodes, all but 
2 within 28 days of a preceding URI. 
Two AOM episodes were diagnosed 
without history of preceding URI. The 
rate of AOM after URI was 21% (178 of 
859). AOM was diagnosed, on average, 
5 days after URI onset (median = 3 
days). Investigators diagnosed 104 
AOMs (58%); others diagnosed 76, 
22 of these with LRI were diagnosed 
by the hospital physicians. Of AOM 
episodes diagnosed by others, 93% 
documented solid evidence of AOM, 
including bulging, purulent fluid/
otorrhea, and/or opacification; 7% 
lacked documentation. Having no 
evidence to invalidate the diagnosis, 
we did not exclude these cases from 
further analyses. The cumulative 
incidence of AOM (percentage of 
subjects with at least 1 AOM episode) 
by specific age is shown in Table 2. 
The prevalence of AOM at ages 6 and 
12 months was 0.56 and 0.67 per 
patient-year, respectively.
Factors Affecting AOM Occurrences 
in the First Year of Life
Nasopharyngeal Bacterial Colonization
Bacterial culture results from 
nasopharyngeal swabs collected 
monthly and during URI/AOM 
episodes in subjects with (n = 143) 
and without AOM (n = 168) in the 
first year of life are shown in Fig 1. 
Colonization rates with 3 pathogenic 
bacteria increased with age. Infants 
with AOM were colonized more 
often with pathogenic bacteria 
overall (P < .005), with Haemophilus 
influenzae (P < .001), and with 
Moraxella catarrhalis (P = .015). 
Statistically significant difference 
was not detected for Streptococcus 
pneumoniae (P = .54).
Viral URI
A total of 311 subjects had 859 
URI episodes. There were 466 URI 
episodes in 143 subjects with AOM 
and 393 episodes in 168 subjects 
without AOM. Subjects with AOM had 
significantly more frequent URIs than 
those without (4.7 vs 2.3 episodes 
per child-year; P < .002). Types of 
viruses and viral load in URI with 
or without AOM from cases seen by 
the study group were previously 
reported.21 Overall, 2153 specimens 
from 362 subjects were tested21; 
viruses were detected in 76% of URI 
samples: 60% with a single virus and

40% with multiple viruses. Viruses in 
single-virus samples were as follows: 
RV (55%), RSV (11%), parainfluenza 
(8%), coronavirus (8%), MPV (7%), 
adenovirus (4%), enterovirus (3%), 
bocavirus (2%), and influenza (2%).
Viral and Bacterial Interactions During 
URI and AOM
Of 413 URI episodes seen by the 
study group, bacterial and viral 
data, obtained within 7 days of URI 
onset, were available in 395 (96%) 
episodes. Tables 3 and 4 report 
hazard ratios (HRs), comparing viral 
and/or bacterial pathogens, against 
reference. Table 3, top, shows HRs 
during URI events by presence of 
bacteria or viruses. The presence 
of any virus, M catarrhalis, or S 
pneumoniae was associated with an 
increased URI risk. Data from this 
model also suggested significant 
interactions between M catarrhalis 
(but not other bacteria) and RSV, 
RV, and MPV; therefore, we further 
analyzed these specific interactions 
within each subset (Table 3, bottom). 
Presence of RSV, or M catarrhalis, 
but not both, increased URI risk 
compared with neither. There was 
no significant difference detected 
between cases with RSV, compared 
with M catarrhalis on URI risk in this 
subset. For RV and MPV, presence 
of M catarrhalis, virus, or both 
significantly increased URI risk, 
compared with neither. Also, the 
presence of RV or MPV increased URI 
risk, compared with presence of M 
catarrhalis without virus.
Table 4 reports AOM risk by presence 
of virus and/or bacteria. Of 104 AOM 
episodes diagnosed or confirmed 
by the study group, there were 
83 (80%) episodes with available 
bacterial and viral data within 7 
days of AOM diagnosis and before 
antibiotic treatment. The presence 
of any virus or S pneumoniae 
significantly increased the AOM 
risk, compared with no pathogens 
(Table 4, top). Data also suggested 
interactions of M catarrhalis, but 
not other bacteria, with RSV and RV. 
Therefore, we further analyzed these 
specific subsets (Table 4, bottom). 
The presence of M catarrhalis, RV, or 
both increased AOM risk, compared 
with neither; but the presence of RV 
did not alter AOM risk, compared 
with presence of M catarrhalis. The 
presence of M catarrhalis, RSV, or 
both increased AOM risk, compared 
with neither. Also, RSV, compared 
with M catarrhalis, increased AOM 
risk, but M catarrhalis with RSV 
decreased AOM risk, compared with 
RSV without M catarrhalis.
Environmental and Genetic Factors
We collected environmental risk 
data at enrollment and during 
monthly visits, URI and AOM visits, 
and phone interviews, an average 
of 12 data encounters per subject. 
Environmental and genetic factors 
associated with URI and AOM risks, 
modeled through a multivariate 
logistic mixed model, are shown in 
Tables 5 and 6. We analyzed data in 
the first 6 months of life because all 
infants were followed until 6 months 
of age (n = 239 infants); available 
data after 6 months were not 
uniform, as the subjects completed 
the study after the first AOM episode 
was diagnosed. Day care attendance 
and multiple siblings were associated 
with increased URI risk. Decreased 
URI risk was associated with birth 
after February 2010, exclusive 
breastfeeding >6 months, increased

breastfeeding duration, and 
increased length of time to exclusive 
formula feeding.
Seventy infants experienced 87 
AOM episodes before age 6 months. 
Compared with infants without AOM, 
decreased AOM risk was associated 
with the following: exclusive 
breastfeeding >3 months, increased 
duration of breastfeeding, and 
increased length of time to exclusive 
formula feeding. We did not detect 
any environmental or genetic factor 
that increased AOM risk in this model.
DISCUSSION
In this large American birth cohort 
study performed during the PCV 
and influenza vaccine era, infants 
experienced 3.2 URIs per child-
year. Birth cohort studies on viral 
respiratory infections have been 
conducted mostly outside the United 
States and have focused on LRI and 
childhood asthma2, 
3, 
26–28; we focused 
on AOM, the most common URI 
complication. We clearly showed 
that frequent viral infections, 
bacterial colonization, and lack of 
breastfeeding are major AOM risk 
factors. Our data also suggested that 
interactions between M catarrhalis 
and respiratory viruses may alter the 
risk for both URI and AOM.
Our study provided close follow-up 
of subjects for URI and AOM and our 
passive surveillance of data from 
electronic medical records covered 
all pediatric practices in Galveston 
plus review of AOM diagnoses by 
others. AOM incidence in our study 
was 6%, 23%, and 46% by ages 3, 
6, and 12 months, respectively, an 
appreciable decrease from incidence 
in previous studies with similar 
design. Data from studies in the late 
1980s and 1990s reported 18% 
AOM incidence at age 3 months, 
29 30% to 39% at 6 months, 
12, 
29, 
30 
and 60% to 62% at 1 year.12, 
29 It 
is likely that medical interventions 
in the past few decades, such as the 
use of pneumococcal and influenza 
virus vaccines, higher breastfeeding 
rates, 
18 and decreased smoking, 
17 
helped reduce AOM incidence. 
More recent reports from population 
birth cohort studies using ques-
tionnaire or parental interview have 
reported even lower OM incidences

(eg, 5%–16% at 6 months, 
31, 
32 and 
23% at 1 year of age32).
Viral respiratory infections are 
common in infants. More than 75% 
of our subjects had developed a URI 
by age 6 months while they may still 
have had maternal antibodies, and 
>90% had URI by 12 months. LRI was 
diagnosed in 11% and 18% by age 6 
and 12 months, respectively. Because 
of our focus on AOM, many infants 
completed the study after the first 
AOM episode, or at age 6 months. 
Therefore, the incidence of URI and 
LRI in the second 6 months of life 
may not be as accurate as during 
the first 6 months due to a smaller 
number of subjects remaining in the 
study. Nevertheless, our data point 
to the significant current morbidity 
of viral respiratory infections and 
the clear benefit of breastfeeding in 
reducing both URI and AOM, as has 
been previously shown. Interestingly, 
we found that infants born after 
2010, who received PCV13 in place 
of PCV7, experienced a decreased 
URI risk but not AOM risk. The 
number of AOMs was small and 
these results may not be related 
specifically to PCV immunization. 
The small number of AOM events 
may also explain lack of association 
between day care attendance or 
number of siblings and increased 
AOM risk.
Our previous studies of children 
age 6 months to 9 years had shown 
associations between TNF−308 and 
IL-6−174 polymorphisms and OM 
susceptibility.22, 
23 The original aim of 
the current study was to determine 
the mechanisms by which genetic 
risk, as represented by TNF−308 
renders the host OM susceptible. 
Unfortunately, our attempt to enroll 
equal numbers of infants with 
TNF−308 polymorphism and matched 
controls was discontinued because 
of the disruption of the Galveston 
population after Hurricane Ike 
(2008). The final proportions of 
subjects with TNF−308 and IL-6−174 
polymorphisms were within 
populations previously described 
(3%–44% for TNF−308 and 32%–47% 
for IL-6−174).22, 
23, 
33, 
34 Interestingly, 
these polymorphisms did not affect 
AOM susceptibility in this study. 
The difference in results may be 
from the young age of our subjects. 
Because maternal antibodies protect 
infants from infections early in 
life, it is possible that the effects 
of these polymorphisms on AOM 
susceptibility are evident only at 
a later age when AOM incidence is 
higher (eg, at peak age incidence of 
6–36 months). A recent study of 96 
infants <9 months of age also did 
not find TNF−308 and IL-6−174 to be 
associated with AOM susceptibility.35
Because of the wide variety of 
respiratory viruses and pathogenic 
bacteria, analyses of viral-bacterial 
interactions are complex, especially 
in studies with longitudinal data. 
Previous studies have analyzed 
associations between viral-bacterial 
interactions and AOM risk by 
comparing data from cases with 
and without AOM.6, 
36 Others have 
studied viral-bacterial interactions 
in asymptomatic children.37, 
38 We 
analyzed the risk, as represented by 
HR, during URI and AOM events given 
the presence of specific bacteria 
and viruses. Interestingly, we found 
that not only viruses increased URI 
risk, M catarrhalis and S pneumoniae 
also increased URI risk. On the other 
hand, we found better protection 
for S pneumoniae (infants born after 
2010) associated with decreased URI 
risk. One recent study of children 
with URI symptoms reported that 
rhinitis, nasal congestion, and cough 
had positive associations with M 
catarrhalis colonization39; another 
study reported a positive association 
between rhinitis and H influenzae 
colonization.40 These findings taken 
together suggest that colonizing 
bacteria may also enhance URI 
symptoms during viral infection.
During URI, presence of M catarrhalis 
increased URI risk, regardless of 
the presence or absence of viruses. 
Interestingly, the M catarrhalis–RSV 
interaction showed a significant 
decrease in AOM risk compared with 
that with RSV alone, but the numbers 
were small. These complex viral-
bacterial interactions may provide 
clues to the pathogenesis of URI 
and AOM, but studies using larger 
samples are needed. Better knowledge 
of these mechanisms could lead to 
interventions such as development 
of new bacterial and viral vaccines,

CONCLUSIONS
URI was common during infancy and 
contributed to complications such as 
AOM, sinusitis, and LRI. Compared 
with previous decades, the incidence 
of AOM has decreased. Prolonged 
breastfeeding was associated with 
significant reductions of both URI and 
AOM. S pneumoniae and M catarrhalis 
were important coinfecting bacteria 
during URI in infants. Viral-bacterial 
interactions during URI and AOM 
may increase the risk of disease 
manifestations. These complex viral-
bacterial interactions require further 
investigations.
