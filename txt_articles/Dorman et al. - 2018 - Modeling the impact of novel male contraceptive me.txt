Abstract
Objective—We modeled the potential impact of novel male contraceptive methods on averting 
unintended pregnancies in the US, South Africa, and Nigeria.
Study Design—We used an established methodology for calculating the number of couple-years 
of protection (CYP) provided by a given contraceptive method mix. We compared a “current 
scenario” (reflecting current use of existing methods in each country) against “future scenarios,” 
(reflecting whether a male oral pill or a reversible vas occlusion was introduced) in order to 
estimate the impact on unintended pregnancies averted. Where possible, we based our assumptions 
on acceptability data from studies on uptake of novel male contraceptive methods.
Results—Assuming only 10% of interested men would take up a novel male method and that 
users would comprise both switchers (from existing methods) and brand new users of 
contraception, the model estimated that introducing the male pill or reversible vas occlusion would 
decrease unintended pregnancies by 3.5% to 5.2% in the US, by 3.2% to 5% in South Africa, and 
by 30.4% to 38% in Nigeria. Alternative model scenarios are presented assuming uptake as high as 
15% and as low as 5% in each location. Model results were sensitive to assumptions regarding 
novel method uptake and proportion of switchers vs. new users.

1. Introduction
In 2012, an estimated 40% of pregnancies were unintended, totaling 85 million unintended 
pregnancies worldwide.[1] Unmet need for contraception (defined as the number of 
sexually-active, fecund people who wish to limit or postpone births, but are not currently 
using contraception) varies globally. In 2010, women’s unmet need was estimated at 5.9% in 
the US and 23.2% in Africa.[2] In three West African countries, estimates for wife-only 
unmet need (33 to 40%) tended to be greater than husband-only unmet need (15 to 23%). 
This latter figure represents a sizeable need and suggests that men could be an under-utilized 
entry point for contraceptive use in couples.[3]
Globally, both women’s and men’s preferences for family size are shrinking, but many 
exceed their desired family size.[4] Even in countries that tend towards pro-natalist attitudes, 
desired family size among men is decreasing.[5]
As women bear the physical responsibility of pregnancy and often an unequal share of child-
rearing, it is critical that they have access to the existing variety of female-controlled, safe, 
effective, acceptable, and affordable contraceptive methods. Existing male-controlled 
methods are limited to condoms, withdrawal, and vasectomy, which are used by 
approximately 11.6%, 4.6%, and 10.8% of men in the US and by 2.4%, 1.3%, and 0% of 
men in sub-Saharan Africa, respectively.[6]
Clinical trials using actual products, such as gels or injectables, have assessed the 
acceptability of novel male contraceptive methods.[7–11] Surveys or qualitative studies have 
also assessed acceptability of hypothetical products described to participants.[12–14] 
Clinical trial data suggest certain novel male methods would be acceptable to some users. Of 
38 men who completed a trial involving a topical testosterone gel and injection combination, 
50% reported being “satisfied or very satisfied” with the regimen and 45% said they would 
use it if it were commercially available.[7] In a trial evaluating a testosterone injectable, 61% 
of the 44 participants who completed the 1-year exposure period rated the method as 
excellent or good and 79% indicated that they would use it if it were available.[10]
Hypothetical acceptability of male contraceptive pills or injections is high in some groups, 
but shows wide variability. Despite reported skepticism over factors such as safety and 
efficacy, in one study, hypothetical willingness to try a male pill ranged from 44% (men in 
Hong Kong) to 83% (White men in Cape Town); and willingness to try an injectable ranged 
from 32% (men in Edinburgh) to 62% (White men in Cape Town).[13] A survey including 
9,000 men aged 18–50 from nine countries found that willingness to try a novel male

 hormonal contraceptive ranged from a low of 28.5% of men in Indonesia to a high of 71.4% 
of men in Spain, with daily oral dosing being the preferred route across all countries 
surveyed.[12] Willingness to use such methods in the US was estimated to be 49.3%. 
Features likely to impact the acceptability of novel male methods include efficacy, delivery 
route, timing of onset of effectiveness, side effects, requirements for use (i.e., semen analysis 
or regular clinic visits), reversibility, female partner perspectives, sociodemographic 
characteristics of the user, and expense.[12]
Studies have also assessed women’s attitudes towards use of a novel contraceptive method 
by their male partner.[14–17] In a survey of almost 2,000 women in Scotland, South Africa, 
and Shanghai, over 70% of participants would be willing to rely on their partner’s use of a 
hormonal male contraceptive and only 2% of the sample would not trust their partner to use 
it.[16] A study by Audu et al (2008) in Northeast Nigeria found 54% of 417 women would 
prefer a male partner to use contraception instead of themselves (though this likely pertained 
to current male methods).[15]
Given high unintended pregnancy rates and unmet need for contraception in many regions of 
the world, and promising acceptability data for novel male contraceptive methods, we sought 
to model the hypothetical impact on unintended pregnancy rates with the introduction of a 
new, effective, and reversible male contraceptive method.
2. Materials and Methods
We estimated the impact of an effective, reversible male contraceptive on unintended 
pregnancies averted in three diverse settings: the United States (relatively high contraceptive 
use, including substantial long-acting and permanent method use), South Africa (relatively 
high contraceptive use, particularly of injectables), and Nigeria (relatively low contraceptive 
use). We used Microsoft Excel to build a model comparing annual unintended pregnancies 
in a “current scenario,” (based on the current contraceptive method mix) against a “future 
scenario” in which one of two effective, reversible male contraceptive methods was 
introduced, either a pill, or a reversible vas occlusion procedure. We chose these two 
methods because many researchers around the world are working to develop various types of 
male contraceptive pills, and several researchers are working on different approaches to 
reversible vas occlusion.[18–22] While regulatory approvals are many years away, a male 
pill and/or a reversible vas occlusion procedure may become real options.
Estimation of unintended pregnancies averted was based on couple years of protection 
(CYP) calculations following the methodology published by MEASURE Evaluation [23] 
(see Appendix A for details). By multiplying the total CYP by the proportion of pregnancies 
that are unintended (0.288 per CYP in our model),[24] we estimated unintended pregnancies 
averted based on a given method mix. Perry et al (2016) used a similar approach to estimate 
the public health impact of increased vasectomy uptake in eight low-resource countries.[25] 
In that work, Perry et al. used National Demographic and Health Survey data from each of 
the target countries as well as contraceptive commodity cost estimates [26, 27] to calculate 
the cost per CYP of the nations’ current contraceptive method mix. The analysis then 
compared the cost effectiveness of the current method mix to a method mix that included a

 5% increase in vasectomy use by the year 2020. Additionally, the analysis estimated the 
increase in the number of averted unintended pregnancies, maternal and infant deaths, 
unsafe abortions, and case-fatalities due to increase overall CYP of a method mix that 
included greater vasectomy use.
Table 1 presents the required modeling inputs to establish the “current” scenario, including 
number of current users (restricted to married or coupled, fecund women aged 15 to 49), 
current use of modern methods in each geography, annual discontinuation rates for users still 
in-need of contraception (i.e. trying to avoid pregnancy), and CYP conversion factors for 
each method (Appendix A). We based in-need discontinuation rates for Nigeria and South 
Africa on discontinuation rates from DHS data in Kenya, as no discontinuation data were 
available specific to these countries. The list of contraceptives considered is not exhaustive, 
but includes most commonly-used methods for which necessary data were available.
Calculating the future scenario CYP required data on use of existing and novel methods; 
discontinuation rates for novel male methods; and CYP conversion factors for novel male 
methods. We used corollaries from existing female contraceptive methods as proxies to 
determine discontinuation rates and CYP conversation factors for novel male methods. We 
assumed that the male pill would have the same discontinuation rate and CYP conversion 
factor as female pill. For all long-acting or permanent methods (LAPMs) (both existing and 
the hypothetical reversible vas occlusion method), the years of coverage provided by each 
method was assumed to be 1, given that our analyses were concerned with the impact on 
annual unintended pregnancy rates.
No existing corollary or historic uptake data were available as a proxy to estimate the 
number of novel male method users (or, for the purposes of the CYP methodology, the 
number of women likely covered by a novel male method). Thus, we estimated the uptake of 
novel male method users based in part on survey data [12, 13] from key geographies of 
interest.
Since only a subset of men who express willingness to try a novel method would likely do 
so, we conservatively assumed the annual number of users for both novel male methods in 
each country to be 10% of men who expressed a willingness to try one. In the US, 49.3% of 
men reported willingness to try a new form of male contraception (daily oral pill, monthly 
injectable, or annual implant).[12] In South Africa, willingness to use a male pill varied 
from 55% (Black men) to 83% (White men),[13] so we conservatively used the lowest figure 
(55%). Thus, the number of novel method users was estimated at 4.9% and 5.5% for the US 
and South Africa, respectively.
According to the 2013 Nigeria national DHS, only 16% of married women have an unmet 
need for contraception – 12% for spacing and 4% for limiting – despite a low prevalence of 
contraceptive use.[28] We chose a cap of 3.8% uptake for a novel male method because (a) 
no country-specific acceptability data were available for Nigeria, and (b) 3.8% is the level of 
the most-used existing method (female injectable). In the Nigeria analyses, we applied a cap 
to ensure the uptake of a novel male method did not exceed the current usage of the most 
prevalent existing method (injectables).

 Table 2 presents inputs used in the “future scenarios,” in which the male pill or reversible 
vas occlusion is introduced. We assumed the projected number of novel male method users 
would be comprised of some “switchers” (currently covered by existing methods) and some 
“new users” (not currently using contraception). For each geographic area, switchers were 
determined based on the proportion of current reversible-method users (i.e. those who could 
discontinue their current method in favor of a new one), and new users were determined 
based on the proportion of those not currently using contraception. We proportionally drew 
switchers in each geographic area from the current users of all reversible methods, so there 
are slightly fewer users of reversible methods in the inputs for future scenarios (Appendix 
A).
3. Results
Our model suggests that introduction of the male pill or reversible vas occlusion would avert 
an additional 3.5% to 5.2% unintended pregnancies in the US, and 3.2% to 5% unintended 
pregnancies in South Africa, respectively (Table 3). In Nigeria, the estimates would be 
substantially higher, at 30.4% to 38% more unintended pregnancies averted for the two 
methods, respectively (Table 3). Such results compare favorably with the real-world 
decrease in unintended pregnancy rates of 2% achieved in Africa from 2008 to 2012.[1]
Our model estimates that introducing reversible vas occlusion will avert more unintended 
pregnancies than a male pill in all countries, even when assuming that reversible vas 
occlusion would confer only one year of contraception. The differences in the current 
method mix of each country can largely explain the difference in magnitude of impact by 
country. In the US and South Africa, introduction of novel male methods would decrease 
unintended pregnancies, but impact would be mitigated by the high prevalence of other 
methods already in use. In Nigeria, where current use of contraception is very low, even a 
3.8% uptake of a novel male contraceptive method could have a dramatic impact.
Model results were robust to variation in discontinuation rates but were more sensitive to 
assumptions around male method uptake (Table 4). However, even assuming that only 5% 
(instead of the model’s 10% assumption) of men who indicated interest in using a novel 
male method would actually adopt the method, the increase in unintended pregnancies 
averted still ranges from 1.6% to 2.6% in the US and South Africa, and between 22% to 
27.5% in Nigeria. When assuming 15% of men who indicated interest would adopt a novel 
male method, results for the US and South Africa climb to 7.8% and 7.5%. If all users of 
novel male methods were assumed to be new users (instead of some new users and some 
switchers from other methods, as in our main model), more unintended pregnancies would 
be averted, ranging from a 6.7% increase in the US (male pill scenario) to a 41.7% increase 
in Nigeria (reversible vas occlusion scenario). Though these scenarios seem unlikely, they 
help to illustrate the potential upper bound of impact that novel male methods could provide.
4. Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to quantify the potential impact of novel male 
contraceptive methods on unintended pregnancy across countries. We used a standardized

 approach to calculate number of unintended pregnancies averted in each country. Where 
possible, we leveraged existing data for female methods (such as discontinuation rates and 
units per CYP), and used conservative assumptions for our main model, while exploring 
variation in sensitivity analyses.
Limitations of this analysis include the need to rely on assumptions (due to the hypothetical 
nature of the research question) and limitations of available data. Substantial uncertainty 
exists around hypothesized “uptake” of novel male contraception in each country. Data from 
acceptability studies conducted in 1995–6 and 2002, respectively, informed our assumptions, 
but this data may not reflect current attitudes. Furthermore, it remains unclear how precisely 
these studies can predict actual behavior with the contraceptive methods in our model. We 
assumed similar acceptability across methods, though real preferences may vary according 
to various factors described earlier [12] and by administration schedules and formulations.
[13] Service delivery and cost coverage may also limit fulfilment of preferences and 
continuation of use. In a similar way women may be unable to access their preferred 
contraceptive due to lack of insurance, high co-pays, and/or a myriad of other political, 
structural, cultural and social barriers.[29, 30] Similarly, without data to inform an 
alternative approach, our model assumed that current users of reversible methods switch to 
using novel male methods in equal proportions, which may not reflect real-world nuances of 
method preference and switching behavior. For example, women may derive non-
contraceptive benefits from their current hormonal method and may therefore switch to 
relying on a novel male method at different rates than, for instance, women who currently 
rely on male condoms. In the absence of concrete target product profiles, we assumed that 
novel male methods would have analogous efficacy and discontinuation profiles as current 
female-controlled options. Finally, our model captures the impact of novel male methods 
only among married or partnered women, for whom the necessary data on current 
contraceptive use was available, which likely underestimates the population of contraceptive 
users and potential impact on averting unintended pregnancies.
The CYP indicator itself was another limitation in our analysis. CYP does not capture the 
fact that a novel male method could prevent pregnancies in multiple partners per male user. 
Additionally, CYP indicators reflect the contraceptive effectiveness of a single contraceptive 
unit (e.g., oral pill packet, male condom, IDU, etc.). In our model, we rely on cross-sectional 
data to estimate contraceptive use for each method. We then estimate the number of units 
used in a given year by factoring in discontinuation of short-term methods (pills, condoms 
and injectables). However, we do not factor in potential discontinuation of long-term non-
permanent methods (IUDs and implants) within a 12-month period. Our estimates assume 
that one long-term non-permanent method procedure contributed one CYP to the 
contraceptive effectiveness of the method mix. Discontinuation rates of long-acting methods 
range widely worldwide. A 2011 World Health Organization report suggested an all-cause, 
12 month IUD discontinuation rate in fourteen developing countries to range from 9.6% to 
37.3%.[31] Discontinuation of long-term non-permanent methods in our model would 
reduce their estimated contraceptive contribution. However, our model is not sensitive to 
potential switching that may occur within a year after discontinuation, which may mitigate 
any reduction in overall CYP of the method mix.

 Furthermore, broader contraceptive choice for men may impact dual use of contraception. 
Dual use could increase, especially among individuals who continue to use condoms for 
disease prevention, or decrease as contraceptive options for men expand beyond condoms. 
The CYP indicator cannot capture the implications of such dynamics; a new statistical 
methodology may be required to fully capture the dynamics of a landscape including novel 
male methods. Other potential challenges relevant to the success of a novel male method that 
fall outside the scope of the current analysis include time, development costs, training needs, 
regulatory hurdles, and the lack of delivery systems that address the reproductive health 
needs of men. Additional investigations of these factors will be critical.
We intentionally narrow our discussion to the impact of a novel male method on unintended 
pregnancies averted; but funders and policy-makers must also consider potential ancillary 
benefits (i.e., increased male reproductive autonomy, potential decreased burden on women 
to shoulder contraceptive responsibility) and potential risks (potential condom displacement, 
or potential for reproductive coercion by men who falsely claim to be using male 
contraception). Additionally, some novel male-methods might require men and their partners 
to use alternative contraception until sperm counts fall sufficiently low. Other novel oral 
agents target sperm function or sperm transport rather than sperm production. These 
methods would not require sperm counts and their onset of action would be more rapid. 
Effective counseling can shape how men and their partners establish open communication 
about these risks and how to confirm that the method is working effectively if confirmation 
were required.
In conclusion, novel male methods could substantially reduce the number of unintended 
pregnancies in a variety of settings. Among women, research shows that making more 
methods available increases use.[32] The same may be true for men. The current analysis is 
limited due to data gaps and the dearth of statistical models capable of capturing male and 
female participation in contraception. These projections warrant additional research into (1) 
the potential role of male contraception; and (2) the development of new male 
contraceptives.

Appendix A - Calculation of CYP
Overview of Approach
The estimated contraceptive potential offered by a specific contraceptive method mix 
directly informed our estimation of the number of unintended pregnancies averted in our 
models. To estimate the contraceptive potential of a population’s contraceptive method mix, 
we took into account estimated size of a population, the use prevalence of each contraceptive

 method (i.e., population-specific contraceptive prevalence rates [CPRs]) in that population’s 
method mix (with total population as the denominator), the estimated, annual, method-
specific discontinuation rates, and the estimated couple-years of protection (CYP) provided 
by a single unit of effective contraception.
CYP provides an estimate of the contraceptive protection offered by a single unit of a given 
contraceptive method. For example, a single Depo Provera injection provides roughly three 
months or 0.25 years of contraceptive protection. Likewise, a single Implanon implant is 
estimated to provide a couple with 2.5 years of contraceptive protection.[23] A contraceptive 
method’s “CYP conversion factor” is the number, or fraction, of years of contraceptive 
protection offered by a single contraceptive unit.
We estimated the total CYP of a method mix by calculating the number of contraceptive 
units used by a population based on population size, population and method-specific 
contraceptive prevalence rates, and estimated discontinuation rates for short-term methods. 
We then multiplied the total number of units used annually by the method-specific CYP 
conversion factor. We then summed the CYP for each method to obtain a total CYP figure 
for the specific method mix. Then, we multiplied the total CYP of a method mix by the 
estimated number of unintended pregnancies averted per CYP[24] to estimate the total 
number of unintended pregnancies averted by the method mix.
Figure A.1 illustrates the calculations involved in estimating the cumulative CYP of a 
method mix.
Step-by-Step Calculations
Described below is a detailed description of the calculations used in our paper. Additionally, 
Table A.1 presents an example of the calculations (using US data) with equations explained 
in green font in the heading rows. For the purposes of our calculations, we defined the data 
inputs required as follows:
•
Total population of contraceptive users – The total number of married or in-
union, fecund women aged 15–49
•
Contraceptive prevalence: This value represents the percent of married or in-
union women in the total population using a given method of contraception. In 
the case of future scenarios, we proportionally drew the number of switchers to 
novel male contraceptive methods from the current users of all reversible 
methods. (See Equation A.1 and Assumptions section.) Note that “users” in all 
cases refers to the population of married or partnered, fecund women aged 15 to 
49 years.
•
Annual in-need discontinuation rate: Short-term methods are subject to 
discontinuation throughout a given year. To account for this, the coverage 
provided by a give contraceptive method factors in the method-specific 
discontinuation rates. Discontinuation rates were selected to reflect only those 
who discontinued and remained in-need of contraception.

 •
CYP conversion factor
○
Units per CYP – For all short-acting modern methods, including pills, 
condoms, injectables, monthly rings/patches, and LAM the conversion 
factor represents the number of units (e.g. the number of 28-day pill 
packs or condoms) necessary to provide contraceptive coverage for a 
year.
○
CYP per procedure – For all long-acting methods, including IUDs, 
implantables, and sterilization, the conversion factor represents the 
number of years of contraceptive coverage provided by a single device 
or procedure. We assumed that CYPs per procedure for all long-acting 
or permanent methods to be 1 in light of the one-year time horizon of 
the current analysis.
Equation A.1. Calculation of potential users of novel methods
Estimating Contraceptive Users by Method
We first estimated the number of individuals using each method of contraception. To do this, 
we multiplied the total number of married or in-union women by the method-specific 
contraceptive prevalence for married or in-union women (Figure A.1 and Table A.1, Column 
D).
CYP of Short-term Methods
To estimate the number of contraceptive units used by STM users in a given year, we 
multiplied the number of method-specific users by the method-specific discontinuation rates. 
We assumed “discontinuers”, on average, to use only half of the annual units of 
contraception; or, in other words, discontinuation would happen, on average, at the mid-year 
point (Figure A.1 and Table A.1, Column G). For example, a full year of coverage with 
Depo-Provera would constitute four injections, so discontinuers, on average, would receive

 only two injections in that time frame (see Assumptions section). We assumed that the 
remaining STM users (i.e. those who do not discontinue in a given year [“continuers”]) used 
all of the units necessary for a full year of protection (Figure A.1 and Table A.1, Column H).
We added total number of contraceptive units for discontinuers and continuers and 
multiplied the sum by the CYP conversion factor to estimate the method-specific CYP of 
each STM (Figure A.1 and Table A.1, Column J).
CYP of Long-acting and Permanent Methods
To estimate the CYP of long-acting and permanent methods (LAPM), we multiplied the 
number of each LAPM users by a method-specific CYP conversion factor (Figure A.1 and 
Table A.1, Column J). For the purposes of our calculations, which sought to quantify CYP 
within a one-year time period, we assumed that all CYP conversion factors for long-term 
methods would be equal to 1.0, the maximum amount of contraceptive coverage that can be 
conferred in a one-year time period (see Assumptions section).
Total CYP of Method Mix
The total CYP of a given method mix was estimated by summing the method-specific CYPs 
for all STMs and LAPMs (Figure A.1 and Table A.1, Column K).
Number of Unintended Pregnancies Averted by Method Mix
To estimate the number of unintended pregnancies averted by a given method mix, the total 
CYP of the method mix was multiplied by the estimated number of unintended pregnancies 
averted per CYP, a value of 0.288 based on a publication by Darroch and Singh (2011) [24] 
(Figure A.1).
Assumptions
•
Calculation of novel male method users: In future scenarios in which novel 
male methods have been introduced, the number of novel male method users 
were assumed to comprise a certain proportion of brand new users (i.e. those 
who were not currently using any modern method of contraception) and 
switchers (i.e. those who switched from their current modern method of 
contraception to a novel male method). We proportionally drew the number of 
switchers from the current numbers of users of reversible methods. This 
assumption implies that users of all current reversible methods would be equally 
as like to switch to a novel male method. This may not reflect reality, as 
numerous factors (including, but not limited to, mode of administration, 
hormonal vs. non-hormonal, beneficial side-effects, and considerations of cost 
and convenience) influence a user’s decision to continue or switch contraceptive 
methods. Therefore, it is unlikely that equal proportions of users from all current 
reversible methods would switch to a single novel male method. However, 
without better data to inform inputs and to avoid introducing additional 
assumptions, we made this simplifying assumption.

 •
Discontinuation: We assumed that those who discontinue a short-term method 
in a given year to consume half the contraceptive units required to confer a year’s 
worth of coverage. In other words, we assumed that discontinuation would occur 
at the mid-way point in a given year. This assumed that discontinuations that 
occur early (after only a few months of use) and late (after nearly a year of use) 
in the year are evenly distributed.
•
CYP per procedure for long-acting/permanent methods: A single unit of a 
long-acting or permanent method (e.g. one IUD, one vasectomy procedure) can 
confer multiple years of contraceptive coverage. Because our aim was to estimate 
the number of unintended pregnancies averted by different method mixes in a 
one-year period, we assumed that all CYP conversion factors for long-term 
methods would be equal to 1.0, the maximum amount of contraceptive coverage 
that can be conferred in a one-year time period. This ensured that our 
calculations would not assign more than one year’s worth of contraceptive 
protection per contraceptive user.
Limitations
The CYP calculation methodology is limited in its ability to quantify the impact of male 
methods on unintended pregnancies averted, given that CYP calculations and CYP 
conversion factors only account for female physiology and fertility, without consideration of 
male physiology. In other words, even when considering male methods such as vasectomy in 
CYP calculations, such methods only account for the amount of protection they provide to 
the female partner. We are not aware of any existing methodology that takes into account the 
physiology of male fertility and have therefore continued to use the same convention for 
calculating CYP of novel male methods. In scenarios introducing novel male methods, the 
“number of users” of novel male methods is the number of women protected by their 
partner’s use of a novel male method.
The focus of our calculations on a one-year snapshot of CYP required that we assume that 
LAPMs confer at most one year of contraceptive protection. This fails to fully capture the 
potential impact of LAPMs on averting unintended pregnancies over a long-term basis.
Furthermore, the CYP indicator cannot capture the fact that a novel male method could 
prevent pregnancies in multiple partners per male user. Furthermore, with broader 
contraceptive choice for men, dual use of contraception may increase, especially among 
young, un-partnered individuals. A new statistical methodology may be required to fully 
capture the dynamics of such a landscape.

 Implications
Novel male contraceptives could play a meaningful role in averting unintended 
pregnancies in a variety of contexts. The potential impact is especially great in settings 
where current use of contraception is low and if novel methods can attract new 
contraceptive users.
