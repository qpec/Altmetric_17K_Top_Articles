L-type voltage-gated calcium channels (LTCCs) are implicated in several psychiatric disorders that are comorbid with alcoholism and
involve amygdala dysfunction. Within the amygdala, the central nucleus (CeA) is critical in acute alcohol’s reinforcing actions, and its

and disrupts this LTCC-based mechanism; instead, corticotropin-releasing factor type 1 receptors (CRF1s) mediate alcohol’s effects on
CeA activity and drive the escalated alcohol intake of alcohol-dependent rats. Collectively, our data indicate that alcohol dependence
functionally alters the molecular mechanisms underlying the CeA’s response to alcohol (from LTCC- to CRF1-driven). This mechanistic
switch contributes to and reflects the prominent role of the CeA in the negative emotional state that drives excessive drinking.

Introduction
Amygdala dysregulation contributes to several human psychiatric
disorders (Bhat et al., 2012), and is hypothesized to drive the transi-
tionfromsocialdrinkingtoalcoholdependence(KoobandVolkow,
2010). Alcoholics display increased amygdala activity during cue-
elicitedcravingsandalcoholintoxication(KoobandVolkow,2010),
and increased amygdala-based perceptions of fear (Townshend and
Duka, 2003). Within the amygdala, the central nucleus (CeA) is a
hubfornegativeemotion,anxiety,andstress;itsactivationpromotes
escalatedalcoholintakeandanxiety-likebehaviorsinwithdrawnrats
(Koob and Volkow, 2010; Gilpin et al., 2015). These clinical and
preclinical findings suggest that chronic alcohol-induced neuroad-
aptations in the CeA may contribute to the pathophysiology of alco-
hol use disorders.
Recently, L-type voltage-gated calcium channels (LTCCs)
have been implicated in several amygdala-related psychiatric dis-
orders that show high comorbidity with alcoholism, such as bi-
polar disease, schizophrenia, and major depression (Bhat et al.,
2012). These channels are high voltage-activating with slow acti-
vation kinetics, and are critical for activity-dependent gene ex-
pression and regulating plasticity at certain synapses (Deisseroth

Significance Statement
The central amygdala (CeA) plays a critical role in the development of alcohol dependence. As a result, much preclinical alcohol
research aims to identify relevant CeA neuroadaptions that promote the transition to dependence. Here we report that acute
alcohol increases CeA neuronal activity in naive rats by engaging L-type calcium channels (LTCCs) and that intra-CeA LTCC
blockade reduces alcohol intake in nondependent rats. Alcohol dependence disrupts this LTCC-based mechanism; instead,
corticotropin-releasing factor type 1 receptors (CRF1s) mediate alcohol’s effects on CeA activity and drive the escalated alcohol
intake of alcohol-dependent rats. This switch reflects the important role of the CeA in the pathophysiology of alcohol dependence
and represents a new potential avenue for therapeutic intervention during the transition period.
The Journal of Neuroscience, April 26, 2017 • 37(17):4593–4603 • 4593
 et al., 2003; Lipscombe et al., 2004). LTCCs normally open too
slowly to respond to single action potentials and are recruited
under conditions that promote prolonged membrane depolar-
ization (Lipscombe et al., 2004). The two major LTCC subtypes,
Cav1.2 and Cav1.3, are expressed throughout the nervous system,
but have different biophysical and subcellular distributions (Hell
et al., 1993; Lipscombe et al., 2004; Sinnegger-Brauns et al., 2009).
These channels preferentially localize to the soma and dendrites
of neurons, and their contribution to action potential-dependent
calcium entry in these regions is unclear. However, their activity
can stimulate inositol trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) and ryan-
odine receptors (RyRs) to promote intracellular calcium release
(Deisseroth et al., 2003).
Previous studies have identified a role for LTCCs in alcohol’s
cellular and behavioral effects. Acute alcohol modulates LTCC
activity in vitro (Walter and Messing, 1999), whereas in vivo
LTCC blockade reduced rodent alcohol consumption (De Beun
et al., 1996; Walter and Messing, 1999), alcohol withdrawal
symptoms (Walter and Messing, 1999; Watson and Little, 2002),
and cue-induced alcohol reinstatement (Uhrig et al., 2017).
There have been a few human alcohol-related clinical trials with
LTCC blockers and modulators, but the effects on alcohol intake,
withdrawal, and abstinence were conflicting (Altamura et al.,
1990; Banger et al., 1992; Rush and Pazzaglia, 1998; Mason et al.,
2014). Notably, gabapentin, which binds the �2� subunit of
LTCCs (and other voltage-gated calcium channels; Sills, 2006)
and suppresses CeA activity (Roberto et al., 2008), increased ab-
stinence in human alcoholics (Mason et al., 2014). It is therefore
critical to further investigate the neurobiological mechanisms
linking LTCCs to alcohol drinking behaviors.
The CeA is an integrative hub that mediates negative emo-
tional responses to fearful and anxiety-inducing stimuli (Gilpin
et al., 2015). CeA activity is central to alcohol’s reinforcing ac-
tions, and its overactivation is a hallmark of the transition to
dependence (Koob and Volkow, 2010; Gilpin et al., 2015). The
CeA is largely (95%) inhibitory, with an extensively intercon-
nected network of GABA interneurons and GABA projection
neurons (Lopez de Armentia and Sah, 2004; Haubensak et al.,
2010; Marek et al., 2013), and we have previously shown that
acute alcohol increases GABA release similarly in the CeA of na-
ive and alcohol-dependent rats (Roberto et al., 2004; Herman et
al., 2013b; Herman and Roberto, 2016). Alcohol-dependent rats
also have increased basal levels of CeA GABA release (Roberto et
al., 2004; Herman et al., 2013b) and increased CeA sensitivity
to stress peptides [particularly corticotropin-releasing factor
(CRF); Roberto et al., 2010; Gilpin et al., 2015]. Here we investi-
gated the specific role of LTCCs in alcohol’s actions in the CeA at
the molecular, cellular physiology, and behavioral levels, and
their potential neuroadaptation with alcohol dependence.
Materials and Methods
All procedures were approved by The Scripps Research Institute Institu-
tional Animal Care and Use Committee and were consistent with the
National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals.
Chronic intermittent ethanol exposure. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats
(n � 140; 345.8 � 6.1 g) were obtained from Charles River Laboratories.
Chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) rats (n � 44) received 5–7 weeks of
daily ethanol vapor (14 h vapor/10 h air). This method consistently pro-
duces physical ethanol dependence in rats, as exhibited by their increased
ethanol drinking behavior, anxiety-like behavior, and reward deficits
(O’Dell et al., 2004; Gilpin et al., 2008; Roberto et al., 2010). Blood
alcohol levels (BALs) were measured 1–2 times/week by tail-bleeding and
upon euthanasia. The mean BAL was 180 � 6 mg/dl. Naive rats (n � 96)
were treated similarly, except with continuous air exposure. CIE rats
were euthanized 15–30 min before the end of daily vapor exposure for
molecular biology tissue collection or electrophysiology slice preparation
in ethanol-free solutions. Thus, the electrophysiology recordings were
performed in brain slices undergoing acute in vitro withdrawal (1–8 h).
Electrophysiology. Rats were anesthetized with 3–5% isoflurane and
decapitated, as previously described (Roberto et al., 2010; Herman et al.,
2013b; Herman and Roberto, 2016; Varodayan et al., 2016). The brains
were placed in oxygenated (95% O2/5% CO2), cold high-sucrose solu-
tion, pH 7.3–7.4, containing the following (in mM): 206.0 sucrose, 2.5
KCl, 0.5 CaCl2, 7.0 MgCl2, 1.2 NaH2PO4, 26.0 NaHCO3, 5.0 glucose, and
5.0 HEPES. Coronal brain slices (300 �m) were incubated in oxygenated
artificial CSF (aCSF) containing the following (in mM): 130.0 NaCl, 3.5
KCl, 2.0 CaCl2, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 1.5 MgSO4, 24.0 NaHCO3, and 10.0
glucose for 30 min at 37°C and then 30 min at room temperature.
We recorded from 324 medial CeA neurons, visualized with infrared
differential interference contrast optics, a 60� water-immersion objec-
tive (Olympus BX51WI), and a CCD camera (EXi Aqua, QImaging).
Whole-cell voltage-clamp and cell-attached current-clamp recordings
were performed in gap-free acquisition mode with a sampling rate per
signal of 10 kHz and low-pass filtered at 10 kHz, using a MultiClamp
700B amplifier, Digidata 1440A, and pClamp 10 software (Molecular
Devices).
For the voltage-clamp recordings, pipettes (3–7 M�; King Precision)
were filled with internal solution containing the following (in mM): 145.0
KCl, 5.0 EGTA, 5.0 MgCl2, 10.0 HEPES, 2.0 Na�-ATP, and 0.2 Na�-GTP.
Spontaneous GABAA-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs)
were isolated with 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (DNQX; 20 �M), DL-
2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (AP-5, 30 �M), and CGP 55845A (1 �M).
Neurons were clamped at �60 mV and experiments with a series resistance
�15 M� or a �20% change in series resistance, as monitored with a 10 mV
pulse, were excluded. For experiments where the aCSF calcium concentra-
tionwasaltered,magnesiumlevelswerealsoadjustedtocompensate.Forthe
current-clamp recordings, pipettes were filled with aCSF so as not to artifi-
cially disturb the ionic balance of the neuronal membrane (Alcami et al.,
2012),andthefiringratewasmeasuredinthepresenceofDNQX,AP-5,and
CGP 55845A. A second set of current-clamp recordings were conducted in
the presence of the GABAA receptor antagonist bicuculline (30 �M), as well
as DNQX, AP-5, and CGP55845A.
For the voltage-clamp experiments, sIPSC frequency, amplitude, and
kinetics were analyzed using Mini Analysis (Synaptosoft) and visually
confirmed. Only sIPSCs �5 pA were accepted for analysis, and average
sIPSC characteristics were based on 2–5 min of recording and a mini-
mum of 60 events. For cell-attached experiments, the event frequency,
with a minimum of 60 events, was analyzed using pClamp and visually
confirmed. To control for cell-to-cell variation in baseline electrophysi-
ology properties, drug effects were normalized to their own neuron’s
baseline (presented as control) before group analyses. All final values
were analyzed for independent significance using one-sample t tests and
compared using two-tailed t tests or two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni
post hoc analyses, using Prism 5.02 (GraphPad). Data are presented as
mean � SEM, with the number of cells and animals used for each exper-
iment reported in the figure legend.
Drugs. We purchased �-agatoxin TK, 2-aminoethoxydiphenylborane (2-
APB), AP-5, CGP 55845A, DNQX, Ro 32–0432, ryanodine, and verapamil
hydrochloride from Tocris Bioscience; 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-
N,N,N�,N�-tetra-acetic acid (BAPTA), bicuculline, nifedipine, and Rp-
cAMP from Sigma-Aldrich; �-conotoxin GVIA from AnaSpec; and alcohol
from Remet. R121919 was synthesized by Dr. Kenner Rice at the Drug De-
sign and Synthesis Section, Chemical Biology Research Branch, National

were dissolved in aCSF and applied locally by Y-tubing (Murase et al., 1989)
or bath perfusion.
Protein expression. Rats were anesthetized with isoflurane and decapi-
tated. Coronal slices (2 mm thick) of naive and CIE rat brains (n � 6 per
group) were prepared with a wire matrix and CeA and control-region
[medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)] tissue were punched on a chilled
stage with an 18-gauge blunt needle and stored at �80°C. Samples were
homogenized in 250 �l buffer A containing the following (in mM): 4.0

 HEPES, pH 7; 320.0 sucrose; 5.0 EDTA, pH 8; phosphatase inhibitor
cocktail (PhosSTOP; Roche Life Science); and protease inhibitor cocktail
(cOmplete, EDTA-free; Roche); using a rotor-stator homogenizer (Tis-
sue Tearor, Cole-Parmer Instrument). The homogenate was enriched for
membrane proteins as previously reported (Goebel-Goody et al., 2009),
with slight modifications. Specifically, the homogenate was centrifuged
(1000 � g, 10 min, 4°C) and supernatant collected. The pellet was resus-
pended in 250 �l buffer A, re-homogenized, re-centrifuged (1000 � g, 10
min, 4°C), and the supernatant combined with the previously collected
supernatant. Total supernatant was centrifuged (100,000 � g, 1 h, 4°C)
and the pellet resuspended in 50 �l buffer A. Samples (25 �g) were
loaded onto a 7.5% SDS PAGE (Mini-PROTEAN TGX, Bio-Rad Labo-
ratories), electrophoresed (100 V, 2 h), and transferred to a PVDF mem-
brane (100 mA, 22 h, 4°C; Immobilon-P, EMD Millipore). Membranes
were washed in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST; Sigma-
Aldrich), blocked in 5% milk/TBST (2 h, room temperature), incubated
in primary antibody (overnight, 4°C; Cav1.2, 240 kDa, 1:500, Alomone
Labs, ACC-003;) and incubated in HRP-conjugated secondary antibody
(1 h, room temperature; donkey anti-rabbit, 1:5000, EMD Millipore,
AP182PMI). Proteins were visualized using enhanced chemilumines-
cence (SuperSignal West Pico, Thermo Scientific Pierce) and exposed to
Hy-Blot CL film (Denville Scientific). To obtain a loading control, mem-
branes were incubated with 0.4% Coomassie stain (in 50% methanol,
10% acetic acid, 40% ddH2O; Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, Bio-Rad)
for 15 min at room temperature, de-stained (50% ddH2O, 43% metha-
nol, 7% acetic acid) and dried (Lee et al., 2015). Digital images were
acquired using light transmission (film) or reflective (membrane) scan-
ning on a Scanjet G4050 (Hewlett-Packard). Protein band optical densi-
ties (ODs) and Coomassie staining were measured using Image Studio
Lite (Li-Cor Biosciences). To control for protein loading variation, each
protein OD was normalized to its own lane’s Coomassie staining (50–
150 kDa; Welinder and Ekblad, 2011), and to control for membrane
differences, the normalized protein value was then normalized to the
mean value of all naive rat normalized values on the membrane. All final
values were compared using two-tailed t tests using Prism 5.02. Data are
presented as mean � SEM.
Alcohol self-administration. Adult male Wistar rats (Charles River Lab-
oratories), weighing 225–275 g at the beginning of the experiments, were
housed two per cage in a temperature-controlled (22°C) vivarium on a
12 h light/dark cycle (lights on at 8:00 P.M.) with ad libitum access to food
and water. All behavioral tests were conducted during the dark phase of
the light/dark cycle.
Self-administration sessions were conducted in standard operant con-
ditioning chambers (Med Associates). Animals were first trained to self-
administer 10% (weight/volume) alcohol and water solutions on an FR1
schedule of reinforcement (i.e., each operant response was reinforced
with 0.1 ml of the solution), until a stable response was maintained. The
rats were then made dependent by chronic intermittent exposure to al-
cohol vapors as previously described (O’Dell et al., 2004; Gilpin et al.,
2008; de Guglielmo et al., 2016). They underwent cycles of 14 h on (BALs
during vapor exposure ranged between 150 and 250 mg/dl) and 10 h off,
during which behavioral testing for operant self-administration occurred
(FR1 schedule of reinforcement for 30 min sessions 3 times per week). In
this model, rats exhibit somatic withdrawal signs and negative emotional
symptoms reflected by anxiety-like responses and elevated brain reward
thresholds (Schulteis et al., 1995; Roberts et al., 2000; Valdez et al., 2002;
Rimondini et al., 2003; O’Dell et al., 2004; Sommer et al., 2007; Zhao et
al., 2007; Edwards et al., 2012). Nondependent rats were not exposed to
alcohol vapor.
Intracranial surgery and microinjections. For intracranial surgery, the
animals were anesthetized with isoflurane. To reach the CeA, guide can-
nulas were implanted bilaterally using the following coordinates with
reference to bregma: anterior/posterior, �2.6 mm; medial/lateral, �4.2
mm; dorsal/ventral, �6.1 mm. Target coordinates were calculated from
a stereotaxic atlas (Paxinos and Watson, 2007) such that cannula tips
were aimed 2.0 mm above the CeA. Obturators were inserted between
microinjections to maintain cannula patency. The animals were allowed
to recover for 1 week after surgery. For the microinjections, an infusion
volume of 0.50 �l was delivered over 2 min by CMA/100 microinfusion
pump (CMA Microdialysis) via 31 G injectors that projected 2 mm be-
yond the tip of the cannulae. Injectors were left in place for 1 min follow-
ing the infusion to facilitate diffusion and reduce backflow.
Drugs. Alcohol drinking solution 10% (w/v) was prepared by dilution
of 95% ethanol (w/v) in water. Nifedipine (Sigma-Aldrich) and R121919
(NIH-NIDA) for systemic administration were dissolved in a vehicle
composed of 5% DMSO, 5% Emulphor and 90% distilled water and
injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) at the doses 7.5 and 15 mg/kg/2 ml (ni-
fedipine) or 10 and 20 mg/kg/2 ml (R121919) 1 h before each test session.
Nifedipine (0.125 �g/0.5 �l) and R121919 (0.15 �g/0.5 �l) for intra-CeA
administration were dissolved in a vehicle composed of 5% DMSO, 5%
Emulphor and 90% distilled water and injected 15 min before each test
session.
Effect of systemic nifedipine and R121919 on alcohol self-administration
in nondependent and dependent rats. After a stable baseline of intake was
established, rats (n � 10) were injected with nifedipine (7.5, and 15
mg/kg/2 ml, i.p.) according to a Latin square design.
Three days after completion of the experiment on nifedipine, daily
alcohol self-administration sessions resumed until stable levels of intake
were re-established. Animals were then tested for the effect of R121919
(10 and 20 mg/kg/2 ml) on alcohol self-administration according to a
second Latin square design.
A second group of rats (n � 12) was moved into the vapor chamber
boxes at the end the self-administration training, and left undisturbed for
3 weeks. Blood samples were collected once a week to determine the
BALs. After this phase, rats were tested for alcohol (and water) self-
administration on an FR1 schedule of reinforcement for 30 min sessions
until escalation of intake was accomplished. At this point the treatment
started and animals were injected with nifedipine (7.5 and 15 mg/kg/2
ml, i.p.) according to a Latin square design. Three days after completion
of the experiment on nifedipine, daily alcohol self-administration ses-
sions resumed until stable levels of intake were re-established. Animals
were then tested for the effect of R121919 (10 and 20 mg/kg/2 ml) on
alcohol self-administration according to a second Latin square design. A
baseline alcohol self-administration session was performed between each
test session in the Latin square designs.

nondependent and dependent rats. At the end of the treatment, the 10 nonde-
pendent and the 12 dependent rats from the experiments described above
were left undisturbed for 1 week, and then implanted with intra-CeA can-
nulae. After 1 week of recovery from the surgery, animals went back to the
self-administrationchamberstorestorethebaselineofalcoholintake.Atthis
point the treatment started and dependent and nondependent rats were
treated with vehicle, nifedipine (0.125 �g/0.5 �l), or R121919 (0.15 �g/0.5
�l) according to a Latin square design. We used just a single Latin square for
both treatments because the two drugs were soluble in the same vehicle and
to reduce the numbers of intra-CeA injections to minimize the tissue dam-
age. At the end of the Latin square brains were harvested for histological
verification of the cannula placement. Histological verification of cannulae
placements revealed three errors (2 nondependent and 1 dependent) and
data from these rats was excluded (see Fig. 3C).
Statistical analysis. Data are presented as mean � SEM and were ana-
lyzed by one-way repeated-measures ANOVA, followed by Newman
Keuls post hoc tests. Escalation data were analyzed by the Student’s t test.
Results
Basal CeA activity is higher in CIE rats
We first assessed the effects of CIE, which induces physical etha-
nol dependence (O’Dell et al., 2004; Roberto et al., 2010), on CeA
GABAergic transmission by recording spontaneous GABAA-
mediated IPSCs (sIPSCs) that were pharmacologically isolated
with glutamate and GABAB receptor antagonists. CIE rats had
significantly (t(128) � 3.45, p � 0.001 by unpaired t test) higher
sIPSC neuronal frequencies (1.26 � 0.17 Hz) versus naive rats
(0.72 � 0.06 Hz; Fig. 1A,B), with no difference in amplitudes and
kinetics. For these experiments, increased sIPSC frequencies re-
flect higher release probabilities, whereas altered amplitudes and
kinetics denote changed receptor sensitivity (Otis et al., 1994).

Varodayan et al. • Alcohol Dependence Alters L-Type Calcium Channels
 Therefore, alcohol dependence increased CeA GABA release,
without affecting GABAA receptor function.
To investigate whether this higher rate of GABA release in CIE
rats stemmed from altered neuronal excitability, we performed
cell-attached recordings in the presence of the same glutamate
and GABAB receptor antagonists. Only a subset of CeA neurons
displayed spontaneous firing and had a regular discharge pattern.
In these cells, the firing rate was similar in naive (1.14 � 0.18 Hz)
and CIE rats (1.45 � 0.20 Hz), indicating that alterations in firing
rates do not drive the elevated GABA release observed in CIE rats
(Fig. 1C,D).
Alcohol increases CeA activity
We next investigated acute alcohol’s effects on CeA cellular phys-
iology. A maximal dose of alcohol (44 mM EtOH; Roberto et al.,
2004) increased the sIPSC frequency in cells from naive (146.6 �
7.3%; t(17) � 6.42, p � 0.001 by one-sample t test) and CIE rats
(141.0 � 6.3%; t(6) � 6.53, p � 0.001; Fig. 1E). Alcohol did not
significantly alter the mean sIPSC amplitude or kinetics; how-
ever, it did increase sIPSC amplitudes in 3/18 naive and 1/7 CIE
cells. Also, the sIPSC response did not change when alcohol was
applied twice to the same neuron (EtOH exposure 1 vs exposure
2: t(5) � 0.78, p�0.47 by paired two-tailed t test; tEtOH1(5) � 3.16,
p � 0.05 by one sample t test; twash(5) � 0.02, p � 0.98 by one
sample t test; tEtOH2(5) � 5.04, p � 0.01 by one sample t test),
indicating the same lack of acute tolerance to alcohol as previ-
ously described (Fig. 1F; Roberto et al., 2004). To investigate the
involvement of postsynaptic calcium in alcohol-induced GABA
release, a calcium chelator (10 mM BAPTA) was added to the
pipette internal solution. BAPTA (in the recording cell) had no
effect on alcohol’s potentiation of CeA neuronal sIPSC frequen-
cies in both naive (t(7) � 3.38, p � 0.05 by one sample t test) and
CIE rats(t(7) � 2.71, p � 0.05), suggesting that this effect does not
require postsynaptic calcium (Fig. 1G).
As spontaneous GABAergic transmission is action potential-
dependent, we also examined alcohol’s effect on cellular firing in
the presence of the same glutamate and GABAB receptor antago-
nists used to isolate the sIPSCs. In naive rats we found bidirec-
tional changes (Herman and Roberto, 2016); alcohol increased
the firing rate to 143.5 � 8.4% in 16/24 naive rat CeA neu-
rons(t(15) � 5.19, p � 0.001 by one sample t test) and decreased it
to 67.4 � 5.5% in 8/24 cells (t(7) � 5.89, p � 0.001; Fig. 1H). In
CIE rats, alcohol increased the firing rate in 14/14 cells (151.5 �
5.8%; t(13) � 8.94, p � 0.001 by one sample t test). To identify
whether these alcohol-induced changes in firing were produced
by alcohol’s enhancement of local inhibitory transmission (i.e.,
increased sIPSC frequencies), a second set of cell-attached re-
cordings were performed in naive rats using the GABAA receptor
antagonist bicuculline (in addition to the glutamate and GABAB
receptor antagonists used in Fig. 1H). In the absence of both
GABA and glutamate synaptic transmission, alcohol still in-
creased the firing rate to 145.4 � 9.1% in 10/17 naive rat CeA
neurons (t(9) � 5.00, p � 0.001 by one sample t test) and de-
creased it to 63.6 � 7.9% in 7/17 cells (t(6) � 4.64, p � 0.01; in
total 17 cells from 5 rats), indicating that alcohol’s effects on
firing are not mediated by alcohol-induced neurotransmission.
Calcium influx drives alcohol-induced CeA activity only in
naive rats
To investigate the role of extracellular calcium in alcohol’s effects
on sIPSCs, we altered the aCSF calcium concentration (from 2 to
0.5 or 5 mM). In naive rats, alcohol’s potentiation of the neuronal
sIPSC frequency was lost in the presence of 0.5 mM calcium aCSF
(t0.5mM(5) � 0.42, p � 0.69 by one sample t test; t5mM(7) � 4.90, p �
0.01), revealing a requirement for extracellular calcium influx
(Fig. 1I). In contrast, alcohol increased the sIPSC frequency in
CIE rat cells regardless of the extracellular calcium concentration
(t0.5mM(4) � 5.25, p � 0.01 by one sample t test; t5mM(4) � 5.24, p �
0.01; Figure 1I). Overall, when the effects of ethanol in all three
aCSF conditions were compared (2 mM aCSF data represented in
Fig. 1E), there was a significant main effect of alcohol dependence
(F(1,43) � 11.80, p � 0.01 by two-way ANOVA) and a significant
interaction between alcohol dependence and extracellular cal-
cium (F(2,43) � 12.90, p � 0.001), with alcohol’s effect in 0.5 mM
calcium aCSF increased in CIE versus naive rats cells (p � 0.001
by Bonferroni post hoc test). There was also a significant per se
effect of 5 mM calcium aCSF (vs 2 mM) on sIPSC frequencies in
naive rats (t0.5mM,naive(10) � 0.49, p � 0.64 by one sample t test;
t5mM,naive(12) � 7.09, p � 0.001; t0.5mM,CIE(5) � 0.73, p � 0.50;
t5mM,CIE(4) � 1.61, p � 0.18; Fig. 1J). Therefore, chronic alcohol
disrupted the requirement for calcium influx in acute alcohol’s
effects on GABA release.
LTCC mechanisms of alcohol-induced CeA activity are lost
with CIE
We then used the LTCC antagonist nifedipine (10 �M) to assess
whether LTCC calcium influx regulates alcohol’s effects. Nifedi-
pine prevented alcohol’s potentiation of sIPSC frequencies in
naive rats (102.0 � 3.6%; t(10) � 0.55, p � 0.60 by one sample t
test), but not in CIE rats (167.6 � 18.9%; t(8) � 3.57, p � 0.01;
Fig. 2A). This group difference (naive vs CIE: t(18) � 3.75, p �
0.01 by unpaired two-tailed t test) suggests that chronic alcohol
exposure produces LTTC neuroadaptation. There were also sig-
nificant differences in nifedipine’s actions on alcohol-induced
firing between the two animal groups (t(14) � 3.82, p � 0.01 by
unpaired two-tailed t test), as nifedipine blocked alcohol’s effect
in cells from naive rats that initially responded with increased
firing (102.3 � 3.6%; t(8) � 0.64, p � 0.54 by one sample t test),
but had no effect in CIE rats (143.8 � 11.5%; t(6) � 3.80, p � 0.01
by one sample t test; Fig. 2B). In both these experiments, we
verified that the cells were alcohol-responsive by first exposing a
subset to alcohol alone (Fig. 2C,D). We found that the previously
alcohol-responsive cells from the naive rat CeA no longer dis-
played alcohol enhancement of sIPSC frequencies or neuronal
firing in the presence of nifedipine (tsIPSC(6) � 4.15, p�0.01 by
paired two-tailed t test; tfiring(8) � 4.79, p � 0.01), despite the
increases produced by alcohol alone (tsIPSC,EtOH(6) � 5.75, p �
0.01 by one sample t test; tsIPSC,wash(6) � 0.10, p � 0.92;

respectively; tcono(6) � 4.56, p � 0.01; taga(3) � 5.59, p � 0.05;

mediated specifically by LTCCs in naive rats, but not alcohol-
dependent rats.
To identify a potential mechanism for this chronic alcohol-
induced disruption in LTCC signaling, we examined LTCC ex-
pression. Neuronal LTCCs are highly expressed, with Cav1.2
(90% of brain LTCCs; Sinnegger-Brauns et al., 2009) enriched at
postsynaptic sites (Hell et al., 1993). Western blotting revealed
decreased CeA Cav1.2 membrane abundance after CIE (t(10) �

 2.26, p � 0.05 by unpaired two-tailed t test; Fig. 2F). There was no
difference in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) Cav1.2 levels in
naive versus CIE rats, despite a previous report of increased cor-
tical LTCC expression in 1 week continuously ethanol-exposed
mice (Katsura et al., 2005), indicating that our model of repeated
alcohol exposures/withdrawals produces brain region-specific
LTCC neuroadaptation.
Despite this disruption in LTCC signaling, we have already
demonstrated that acute alcohol was able to increase CeA neuro-
nal firing and GABA release in CIE rats (Fig. 1E,H). Previous
studies report that alcohol-dependent rats exhibit heightened
sensitivity to corticotropin-releasing factor type 1 receptor
(CRF1) antagonists and increased CeA CRF/CRF1 gene expres-
sion (Roberto et al., 2010), suggesting that the CRF/CRF1 system
may compensate for LTCC disruption. Here we found that the
CRF1 antagonist R121919 (1 �M) did not alter alcohol’s potenti-
ation of neuronal sIPSC frequencies in naive rats (140.9 � 6.2%;
t(8) � 6.65, p � 0.001 by one sample t test), but prevented this
effect in CIE rats (99.8 � 6.2%; t(5) � 0.03, p � 0.97; Fig. 2G).
This group difference in naive versus CIE rats (t(13) � 4.52, p �
0.001 by unpaired two-tailed t test) indicates that the persistent
enhancement of CeA GABA release by alcohol in CIE rats is me-
diated by CRF1s. There were also significant differences in
R121919’s actions on alcohol-induced firing between the two
animal groups (t(10) � 3.43, p � 0.01 by unpaired two-tailed t
test), as the CRF1 antagonist blocked alcohol’s facilitation of neu-
ronal excitability in CIE rats (96.7 � 7.1%; t(4) � 0.46, p � 0.67 by
one sample t test), but not in naive rats (138.0 � 8.8%; t(6) � 4.33,
p � 0.01; Fig. 2H). Therefore, the CRF1 mediates acute alcohol’s
facilitation of neuronal firing and GABA release only in alcohol-
dependent rats.
Intracellular calcium mechanisms of alcohol-induced
CeA activity
LTCC calcium influx can trigger intracellular calcium release via
IP3Rs and RyRs (Ross, 2012), and previous work has identified a
role for these mechanisms in acute alcohol’s effects in other brain
regions (Hirono et al., 2009; Theile et al., 2009; Qi et al., 2010;
Kelm et al., 2011). Here we found that in CeA neurons of naive
rats, alcohol’s effect on sIPSC frequency was prevented by IP3R
blockade (42 �M 2-APB; t(6) � 0.73, p � 0.49 by one sample t
test), but not by RyR blockade (20 �M ryanodine; t(4) � 3.26, p �
0.05; Fig. 2I). 2-APB and ryanodine did not significantly alter
sIPSC amplitudes or kinetics, but 2-APB increased the sIPSC
frequency in 3/7 cells and alcohol’s effect was still blocked in 2/3
of these cells. These relationships were reversed with chronic al-
cohol exposure (naive vs CIE: t2-APB(9) � 2.74, p � 0.05 by un-
paired two-tailed t test; tryanodine(8) � 3.09, p � 0.05 by unpaired
two-tailed t test). Instead, the effects of alcohol on sIPSC frequen-
cies in the CeA of CIE rats were prevented by RyR blockade (t(4) �
0.04, p � 0.97 by one sample t test), but not IP3R blockade (t(3) �
3.22, p � 0.05 by one sample t test; Fig. 2I). These results suggest
that the switch from a LTCC- to a CRF1-based mechanism with
alcohol dependence is accompanied by a shift from a role for
IP3R-mediated calcium-induced calcium release to the involve-
ment of RyRs.
Protein kinase pathways underlying alcohol-induced
CeA activity
LTCCs, CRF1s, and protein kinases A and C (PKA and PKC) all
regulate each other and we have previously identified roles for these
mechanisms in alcohol-induced action potential-independent
GABA release in the CeA of naive mice (Bajo et al., 2008; Cruz et al.,
2011). Here, we found that alcohol’s enhancement of action poten-
tial-dependent sIPSC frequencies was unaffected by PKA (10 �M
Rp-cAMP; t(5) � 4.95, p � 0.01 by one sample t test) or PKC antag-
onism (200 nM Ro 32-0432; t(4) � 4.23, p � 0.05) in naive rat cells,
but was prevented by both antagonists after CIE (tRp-cAMP(6) � 0.99,
p � 0.36 by one sample t test; tRo 32–0432(5) � 1.21, p � 0.28;
Figure 2J). These group differences between naive versus CIE rats
(tRp-cAMP(11) � 4.39, p � 0.01 by unpaired two-tailed t test;
tRo 32–0432(9) �3.65,p�0.01)suggestthatchronicalcoholexposure
alters multiple protein kinase mechanisms so that they mediate al-
cohol’s enhancement of action potential-dependent GABA release
only in alcohol-dependent rats.
CeA LTCCs regulate alcohol intake only in nondependent rats
As CeA activity regulates alcohol intake (Koob and Volkow, 2010;
Gilpin et al., 2015), we assessed the effects of intra-CeA LTCC and
CRF1 blockade in nondependent and alcohol-dependent rats. In
nondependent rats, there was a significant effect of drug on alco-
hol intake (F(2,7) � 7.85, p � 0.01 by one-way ANOVA), with
nifedipine (0.125 �g/side) significantly reducing alcohol intake
(p � 0.01 by Newman Keuls post hoc test), whereas R121919
(0.15 �g/side) had no effect (Fig. 3A). Water intake was unaf-
fected (F(2,7) � 2.6). This relationship was switched in the
alcohol-dependent rats, all of whom significantly escalated their
alcohol consumption during vapor exposure (t(10) � 4.202, p �
0.001 by paired two-tailed t test; Fig. 3B). There was a significant
effect of drug treatment on alcohol intake (F(2,10) � 12.88, p �
0.001 by one-way ANOVA), with intra-CeA R121919 signifi-
cantly reducing alcohol intake in dependent rats (p � 0.001 by
Newman Keuls post hoc test), whereas nifedipine had no effect
(Fig. 3B). Water intake was unaffected (F(2,10) � 0.03). Systemic
nifedipine and R121919 administration (i.p.) produced similar
results (Fig. 3D–G), though a high dose of R121919 also reduced
alcohol intake in nondependent rats (Fig. 3E). Collectively
these data, in accordance with our cellular physiology results on
the mechanisms underlying acute alcohol’s effects on neuronal
activity, suggest that LTCCs govern the alcohol intake of nonde-
pendent rats, while CRF1s mediate the escalated consumption of
alcohol-dependent rats.
Discussion
Here we report that alcohol dependence switches the mecha-
nisms underlying the CeA’s cellular and behavioral responses to
acute alcohol. Alcohol increases CeA neuronal firing and GABA
release in naive rats via LTCCs, and intra-CeA LTCC blockade
reduces alcohol intake in nondependent rats (Fig. 4). Chronic
alcohol exposure decreases LTCC-subtype Cav1.2 membrane
abundance and disrupts this LTCC-based mechanism. Instead,
CRF1s mediate alcohol-induced CeA activity and drive the esca-
lated alcohol intake of alcohol-dependent rats (Fig. 4). This
switch from a LTCC- to a CRF1-based mechanism is accompa-
nied by a shift from a role for IP3Rs to the involvement of RyRs
and PKA/PKC. Therefore, LTCCs are a critical molecular sub-
strate in the CeA’s neurobiological response to alcohol, and their
neuroadaptation with repeated exposure likely contributes to the
pathophysiology of alcohol use disorders.
Similar to previous studies (Chieng et al., 2006; Herman et al.,
2013a; Herman and Roberto, 2016), we observed spontaneous
firing with a regular discharge pattern in only a subset of recorded
cells. In the absence of glutamatergic and GABAergic transmis-
sion, acute alcohol increased the spontaneous firing rate in
two-thirds of these naive rat cells and in all of these CIE rat cells,
indicating that alcohol’s effects on neuronal firing do not stem

 from alcohol-induced changes in neurotransmission and may be
restricted to specific neuronal populations. As the CeA comprises
a highly interconnected network of GABA interneurons and
GABA projection neurons (Lopez de Armentia and Sah, 2004;
Haubensak et al., 2010; Marek et al., 2013), alcohol enhancement
of firing in a restricted neuronal population will most likely in-
crease GABA release onto a large number of CeA neurons (as
observed in this study).
Alcohol activates the central amygdala via LTCCs
We speculate that acute alcohol indirectly regulates LTTCs,
rather than via a direct molecular interaction. LTCC activity can
be modulated by G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs; Deisse-
roth et al., 2003; Catterall and Few, 2008) and alcohol’s cellular
effects can be prevented by several Gs/q-type GPCR antagonists
(Kelm et al., 2011). In particular, LTCCs mediate CRF-induced
action potential firing in corticotropes (Kuryshev et al., 1996)
and CRF signaling contributes to alcohol-induced evoked and
action potential-independent CeA GABAergic transmission
(Roberto et al., 2010; Herman et al., 2013b). Here we found that
CRF1 blockade prevented alcohol-induced spontaneous action
potential-dependent GABA release and neuronal firing only in
CIE rats, suggesting a chronic alcohol-induced neuroadaptation
in somatodendritic CRF1s. More generally, little is known about
how acute alcohol modulates CeA GPCR function, but long-term
exposure alters G-protein interactions with group II metabo-
tropic glutamate receptors (mGluR2/3) and serotonin receptors
(5-HT1A/1B/1D; Chen and Lawrence, 2000; Kufahl et al., 2011).
Somatodendritic LTCCs can be functionally coupled to IP3Rs
andRyRsontheendoplasmicreticulum(ER),sothatLTCCcalcium
influx triggers calcium-induced calcium release (CICR; Deisseroth
et al., 2003). IP3R activation also requires IP3, which is produced by
phospholipase C (PLC) in response to Gq-type GPCR activation by
neuromodulatory ligands like serotonin, acetylcholine and gluta-
mate (Ross, 2012). Therefore, the IP3R is a coincidence detector for
alcohol’s simultaneous induction of LTCCs and PLCs. CICR can be
propagated as a calcium wave along the ER and into the soma (Ross,
2012). In this way, IP3R-mediated CICR can activate calcium-
dependent small-conductance potassium channels, leading to a
transient afterhyperpolarization that constrains action potential
generation and a subsequent prolonged membrane depolarization
that produces a sustained increase in neuronal firing (Hagenston et
al.,2008;El-Hassaretal.,2011).AsimilarresponsetoIP3R-mediated
CICR might drive alcohol’s LTCC-dependent stimulation of CeA
neuronal firing in naive rats.
LTCCcalciuminfluxcausesmassiveandwidespreadCeAactiva-
tion (Hetzenauer et al., 2006) and promotes diverse processes, in-
cluding gene transcription, receptor trafficking, and synaptic
plasticity (Deisseroth et al., 2003; Lipscombe et al., 2004). Therefore,
altered LTCC calcium signaling can profoundly impact CeA func-
tion. Our protein analysis revealed decreased Cav1.2 membrane
abundanceintheCeAofCIEratscomparedwithnaiverats,whereas

gene (Cacna1c) expression during early abstinence. Notably, LTCC
calcium influx can stimulate cAMP response element binding tran-
scriptional activity (Deisseroth et al., 2003), which is associated with
anxiety-like and alcohol drinking behaviors (Pandey, 2003). Ge-
nome-wide association studies have also identified specific Cav1.2
(CACNA1C) polymorphisms as risk factors in several psychiatric
disorders that exhibit amygdala dysfunction and are comorbid with
alcoholism, including bipolar disease, schizophrenia and major de-
pression (Bhat et al., 2012). In particular, the risk allele rs1006737
increased LTCC current density (Yoshimizu et al., 2015) and is as-
sociated with increased amygdala volume (Lancaster et al., 2016)
and enhanced amygdala activity during emotional processing (Tesli
et al., 2013).
Chronic alcohol sensitizes the amygdala CRF/CRF1 system
The chronic alcohol-induced disruption of CeA LTCC function
was accompanied by a heightened regional sensitivity to the CRF/
CRF1 system, as previously described (Roberto et al., 2010).
CRF1s often signal through the adenylyl cyclase (AC)/PKA and
PLC/PKC pathways, though it is unclear whether they act on PKA
and PKC independently or via crosstalk (Gutknecht et al., 2009).
Here, alcohol’s CRF1-mediated effects on CeA GABA release
in CIE rats required PKA/PKC activity, and we have previously
identified similar roles for AC7 and PKC� in naive mice (Bajo et
al., 2008; Cruz et al., 2011; Cruz et al., 2012). CRF is a stress
peptide that is cotransmitted with GABA in the CeA (Partridge et
al., 2016), typically in response to neuronal burst firing (Rainnie
et al., 1992; Yu and Shinnick-Gallagher, 1998), and its actions on
CeA physiology are central to the interactions between negative
emotion, stress and alcohol (Roberto et al., 2010; Gilpin et al.,
2015). Alcohol-dependent rats exhibit increased CeA CRF/CRF1
gene expression (Roberto et al., 2010) and CeA-specific CRF1
blockade prevented their anxiety-like behavior (Rassnick et al.,
1993). Moreover, rat amygdalar CRF peptide levels increase dur-
ing early withdrawal (6–12 h; Merlo Pich et al., 1995) at time
points that coincide with the acute in vitro withdrawal (1–8 h) of
our cellular physiology studies. Notably, chronic stress increased
the synaptic strength and connectivity of CeA CRF-containing
neurons and these changes were associated with anxiety-like be-
havior (Partridge et al., 2016); similar neuroadaptation after
chronic alcohol exposure would likely produce CeA overactiva-
tion, which is considered a hallmark of dependence. As such,
the CRF/CRF1 system is hypothesized to drive anxiety-induced
drinking in human alcoholics (Koob and Volkow, 2010), and
CRF1 (CRHR1) genetic variation has been associated with height-
ened stress sensitivity and greater susceptibility to alcohol depen-
dence in humans (Treutlein et al., 2006).
The CeA is an integrative hub that mediates negative emo-
tional responses to fearful and anxiety-inducing stimuli (Gilpin
et al., 2015). Its activity is central to alcohol’s reinforcing actions,
and its overactivation is a hallmark of dependence (Koob and
Volkow, 2010; Gilpin et al., 2015). Here, we report that the CeA’s
cellular and behavioral responses to alcohol are generated via an
LTCC-based mechanism, which is disrupted after chronic alco-
hol exposure. Although the CRF/CRF1 system can superficially
compensate, LTCC calcium influx is a critical regulator of cellular
processes (Deisseroth et al., 2003). In particular, the absence of
LTCC-driven transcriptional regulation could compound with
every alcohol exposure to produce important changes in CeA
cellular function. Furthermore, the CeA’s heightened sensitivity
to the CRF/CRF1 system with alcohol dependence is associated
with the escalation of alcohol intake (as seen in this study) and the
kindling of anxiety-like behaviors (Koob and Volkow, 2010; Gil-
pin et al., 2015). It is currently unclear whether this switch in the
mechanism underlying the CeA’s neurobiological response to

 alcohol is a cause or consequence of the pathophysiology of de-
pendence. Regardless, these neuroadaptations reflect the promi-
nent role of the CeA in the escalation of drinking, and represent
new potential avenues for LTCC- (Altamura et al., 1990; Banger
et al., 1992; Rush and Pazzaglia, 1998; Mason et al., 2014) and
CRF1-based therapeutic intervention (but see Kwako et al., 2015;
Epstein et al., 2016; Schwandt et al., 2016) in the transition to
alcohol dependence.
