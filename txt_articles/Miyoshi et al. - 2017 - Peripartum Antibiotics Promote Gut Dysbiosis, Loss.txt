In Brief
Miyoshi et al. show that maternal and
neonatal exposure to antibiotics can
cause enduring changes in the gut
microbiome that adversely affect the
development of the immune system. In
genetically susceptible individuals, the
persistence of intestinal dysbiosis and
immune imbalance may increase risk for
immune disorders like inflammatory
bowel diseases.

SUMMARY
Factors affecting the developing neonatal gut micro-
biome and immune networks may increase the risk
of developing complex immune disorders such as
inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). In particular,
peripartum antibiotics have been suggested as risk
factors for human IBD, although direct evidence is
lacking. Therefore, we examined the temporal impact
of the commonly used antibiotic cefoperazone on
both maternal and offspring microbiota when admin-
istered to dams during the peripartum period in the
IL-10-deficient murine colitis model. By rigorously
controlling
for
cage,
gender,
generational,
and
murine pathobiont confounders, we observed that
offspring from cefoperazone-exposed dams develop
a persistent gut dysbiosis into adulthood associated
with skewing of the host immune system and
increased susceptibility to spontaneous and chemi-
cally dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis.
Thus,
early
life
exposure
to
antibiotic-induced
maternal dysbiosis during a critical developmental
window for gut microbial assemblage and immune
programming elicits a lasting impact of increased
IBD risk on genetically susceptible offspring.
INTRODUCTION
Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are chronic disorders that
include two main clinical phenotypes, ulcerative colitis (UC)
and Crohn’s disease (CD). Diseases like IBD are often referred
to as ‘‘new-age’’ disorders because of the alarming increase in
their incidence and prevalence over the past century, particularly
in populations that have undergone rapid changes in industriali-
zation, hygiene, and diet (Bager et al., 2012; Benchimol et al.,
2015; Devkota et al., 2012; Pugazhendhi et al., 2011). While there
is a genetic basis (Anderson et al., 2011; Franke et al., 2010; Jos-
tins et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2015; Liu and Stappenbeck, 2016; Van
Limbergen et al., 2014), it is unlikely that genetic drift alone over
this short period of time accounts for these diseases, raising the
more likely role of environmental risk factors in triggering disease
in genetically predisposed individuals. These factors can affect
individuals in many ways, but their impact on the gut micro-
biome, resulting in disturbances in host-microbe interactions,
may be of relevance to the development and pathogenesis of
IBD (Frank et al., 2007; Gophna et al., 2006; Manichanh et al.,
2006; Ott et al., 2004; Seksik et al., 2003). This may be particu-
larly relevant during the early stages of life when critical events
in the development of the gut microbiome and immune system
are taking place. The identification and avoidance of tipping fac-
tors in early life, therefore, represents a logical and important
strategy for lowering risk of disease. In this regard, the promiscu-
ous use of antibiotics during the preterm and post-natal (peripar-
tum) periods that affect both maternal and neonatal microbiota
has been suggested as a risk factor for human IBD, although
compelling scientific evidence is lacking.
In the United States, it is estimated that antibiotics are pre-
scribed with unclear indications at �21% of pediatric ambulatory
visits, where half of the prescriptions are broad spectrum (Hersh
et al., 2011). Approximately 40% of pregnant women at term and
greater than 30% of neonates are exposed to antibiotics (Broe
et al., 2014; Stokholm et al., 2013). In developed countries,
broad-spectrum antibiotics, such as cephalosporins, are pre-
scribed more frequently during pregnancy (Petersen et al.,
2010). Furthermore, several studies have shown an association
between early life exposure to antibiotics and increased risk of
IBD development, especially treatment-naive pediatric CD (Ge-
vers et al., 2014; Hviid et al., 2011; Kronman et al., 2012; Ungaro
et al., 2014; Virta et al., 2012). However, these studies were
limited in their ability to establish a causal link due to large differ-
ences in inter-individual gut microbiomes, challenges in control-
ling retrospectively for confounding variables, and constraints of
observational clinical design. To address this issue, we took an
alternate approach, using the well-accepted interleukin (IL)-10
knockout (KO) mouse model, where the immunomodulatory
cytokine IL-10 is genetically deleted (K€
uhn et al., 1993). Genetic
risk in IL-10 KO mice is not sufficient to cause disease, because
these animals rarely develop disease if they are raised germ-free
(GF) or housed in a Helicobacter hepaticus-free environment
(Keubler et al., 2015; Sellon et al., 1998). H. hepaticus rarely
causes colitis in wild-type mice but can cause a nearly 100%

(A) Study design using IL-10 knockout (KO) mouse model. All mice (cohorts 1 and 2) were obtained from ten breeding pairs subjected to mixed-bedding protocol
to normalize microbiota among parent cages. Cohort 1 (first row) included two sequential litters from five breeders divided into the non-treatment (NT) tracking
group (litter 1) and the cefoperazone (CPZ) tracking group (litter 2). Cohort 2 (second row) included two sequential litters from five breeders that were used as
additional NT controls to assess/control for generational drift in gut microbiota across litters 1 and 2.

 disease penetrance in IL-10 KO mice (Kullberg et al., 1998). We
examined the temporal impact of the broad-spectrum antibiotic
cefoperazone (CPZ) on both the maternal and offspring micro-
biota when administered to dams during the peripartum period.
Here, we reasoned that vertical transmission of maternal micro-
biota is the major source of microbes for the development of the
infant gut microbiome (Adlerberth and Wold, 2009; Asnicar et al.,
2017; Caufield et al., 1993, 2007; Funkhouser and Bordenstein,
2013; Jime
´ nez et al., 2008; Nayfach et al., 2016; Pantoja-Felic-
iano et al., 2013). Under experimental conditions that controlled
for cage, gender, and age effects, as well as the confounding
presence of common murine pathobionts, we observed that
offspring from CPZ-exposed dams develop gut dysbiosis that
persists into adulthood. This effect is associated with a skewing
of the host immune system and increased susceptibility to the
development of spontaneous and chemically (dextran sodium
sulfate; DSS)-induced colitis in IL-10 KO mice. Fecal microbiota
transplantation (FMT) of CPZ-exposed dams’ microbiota into GF
IL-10 KO mice resulted in a similar skewing of the host immune
response in the offspring of FMT-CPZ recipients to that
observed in the offspring of donor animals. Together, our
findings support the notion that early life exposure to anti-
biotic-induced maternal dysbiosis during a critical develop-
mental window for gut microbial assemblage and immune pro-
gramming can have a lasting impact in genetically susceptible
offspring, increasing the risk for complex immune-related disor-
ders such as IBD.
RESULTS
Antibiotic Treatment in Early Life Increases the Risk for
Colitis in Offspring
The mice used for this study were derived from GF IL-10
KO mice on a C57BL/6 background conventionalized with
H. hepaticus-free donor gut microbiota and subsequently
housed in an H. hepaticus-free room under continuous moni-
toring. To control for genetics and maternal contribution, the
ten breeding pairs used for two sequential parturitions under-
went a vetted normalization protocol involving mixed-bedding
transfers between cages of the same generation before pairs
were set up for breeding (Figure 1A). In cohort 1, the first litters
from each dam were used as the non-treatment (NT) group. For
their second pregnancy, dams were treated with CPZ from
day 14 of gestation and throughout the pre-weaning period (Fig-
ure S1A). The rationale for this protocol was to expose pups
to maternal microbiota that had been conditioned with CPZ at
the time of the pup’s birth, analogous to common practice
scenarios in human populations. Cohort 2 served as additional
controls, with dams untreated throughout both sequential par-
turitions to control for the potential impact of sequential litters
on colitis development. Pups were tracked from 3 weeks of
age through 23 weeks of age. Both genders were studied,
with 17 females and 23 males used for the NT tracking group
and 16 females and 26 males used for the CPZ tracking group.
No differences in the incidence of colitis (0%) were observed
between the first and second litters of cohort 2 NT dams (Fig-
ure S1B). In contrast, peripartum CPZ exposure led to a signif-
icantly decreased survival rate in IL-10 KO pups, particularly in
males (p = 0.018) (Figure 1B). This included 12.5% of female
(2/16) and 30.8% of male (8/26) mice that were sacrificed
because of severe weight loss (a euthanasia criteria). Histolog-
ical examination of their intestines confirmed the presence of
severe colonic inflammation (Figure 1C). As noted by others,
both female and male mice exposed to peripartum CPZ treat-
ment gained more weight initially (Figure 1D), which can be
attributed to the obesogenic effects of antibiotic-induced
mucosal inflammation and gut dysbiosis (Cho et al., 2012).
Females from CPZ-exposed dams continued to exhibit heavier
body weights throughout the 23 weeks relative to NT controls;
however, 8 out of 26 males exposed to CPZ began to lose
weight at as early as 11 weeks of age due to spontaneous colitis
development. Despite this, no significant differences were
observed in histopathology scores for colitis at 3 and 7 weeks
of age between NT and CPZ treatment groups (Figure S1C)
prior to decreases in body weight. Thus, peripartum CPZ
exposure in the absence of H. hepaticus, a known pathobiont,
appears to promote increased risk for spontaneous colitis in
genetically susceptible offspring later in life.
We next examined the mice that remained grossly healthy
and never developed overt signs of spontaneous colitis (NT
group: 17 females, 22 males; CPZ group: 14 females, 18 males).
At 23 weeks of age, histologic grading of colons revealed higher
inflammatory scores, particularly in the distal colons of the CPZ
group compared to NT (n = 5 mice per gender; p = 0.021 in
females, and p = 0.019 in males) (Figure 1E). Fecal lipocalin-2
(LCN-2), a marker for colitis (Chassaing et al., 2012), showed
that both females and males from CPZ-exposed dams had
significantly higher LCN-2 levels as compared to the NT group
(p = 0.037 in females, and p < 0.001 in males) (Figure 1F).
Thus, even in IL-10 KO mice that did not develop frank disease,
peripartum exposure to CPZ is associated with subclinical histo-
logic evidence of colonic inflammation.

 To examine how CPZ-exposed IL-10 KO mice that did not
develop frank colitis would respond to a colitogenic challenge,
mice were administered 2.5% DSS in drinking water at 23 weeks
of age. We observed that both female and male mice from CPZ-
exposed dams had significantly lower survival rates, lost signifi-
cantly more weight, and exhibited more severe histologic injury
from the DSS challenge compared to their 23-week-old NT
counterparts (p = 0.003 in females, and p < 0.0001 in males) (Fig-
ures 1G and 1H). Moreover, as expected, pups from wild-type
C57BL/6 (WT) dams that underwent an identical CPZ exposure
protocol did not develop colitis. Furthermore, at 23 weeks of
age, there were no differences in LCN-2 levels or DSS-induced
colitis susceptibility, regardless of gender (Figures S1D and
S1E), highlighting the importance of genetic susceptibility for
disease development in the case of maternal antibiotic-induced
dysbiosis. Together, these data revealed that maternal CPZ
exposure during the peripartum period in IL-10 KO mice leads
to an increased susceptibility to developing both spontaneous
and chemically induced colitis later in life.
Peripartum Antibiotic Exposure Leads to Aberrant
Development of the Offspring Immune System
To determine whether and how maternal CPZ exposure during
early development alters immune profiles, we first compared
mRNA levels of cytokine genes indicative of T cell subtypes
(Treg, Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells), pro-inflammatory cytokine
genes, and mucosal protective factors relevant to IBD in colons
of 3-week-old pups from CPZ-exposed dams versus NT con-
trols. Male data are shown in Figure 2, and female data are
shown in Figure S2. Exposure to maternal CPZ-induced
dysbiosis elevated mRNA levels of key immune mediators
such as Il17f (p < 0.01 in males), Il4 (p < 0.05 in males), Il13
(p < 0.01 in males), Il1b (p < 0.05 in females), and Il6
(p < 0.01 in males). Conversely, anti-inflammatory and trophic
mediators,
including
Tgfb1
(p
<
0.05
in
males),
Muc2
(p < 0.05 in females) and Reg3g (p < 0.01 in females and males),
were significantly decreased (Figures 2A and S2A). In spite of
the increased mRNA expression of Il4 and Il13, there were no
significant differences in plasma immunoglobulin E (IgE) level
in CPZ pups compared to NT controls (Figure S2D). Next, we
examined markers of several T cell populations prior to the
onset of colitis in NT and CPZ 3-week-old IL-10 KO pups using
flow cytometry. We determined the proportion of T cells ex-
pressing transcription factors indicative of both regulatory and
inflammatory T cell populations, including Forkhead box P3
(Foxp3), T-box transcription factor (T-bet), and RAR-related
orphan receptor gamma t (RORgt). We harvested cells from
the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) and colonic lamina propria
(LP) of 3-week-old NT and CPZ pups. Here, we focused on
CD4+ T cell populations, as shown in the gating strategies
used for flow cytometry in Figure S2F. Specifically, we exam-
ined the percentage of live CD45+TCRb+CD4+ cells (CD4+
T
cells)
that
expressed
Foxp3+
(regarded
as
regulatory
T cells; Tregs), T-bet+ (Th1 cells), or RORgt+ (Th17 cells). We
observed that male CPZ IL-10 KO pups exhibited a significant
reduction in Tregs in both the MLN (p < 0.01) and colonic LP
(p < 0.05), with significant increases in Th17 cells in the MLN
(p < 0.01) as compared to NT counterparts (Figure 2B). Simi-
larly, CPZ IL-10 KO female pups showed significant decreases
in MLN Tregs (p < 0.01) and significant increases in LP Th17
cells (p < 0.05) as compared to NT pups (Figure S2B). These
immune changes were not observed in 3-week-old NT versus
CPZ WT mice, with the exception for significant differences
detected in MLN Th1 cells from WT females (Figure S2E).
As shown in Figure 2C, 23-week-old male CPZ IL-10 KO
mice that survived and did not develop spontaneous colitis still
showed significantly higher levels of interferon (IFN)-g (p < 0.01)
and IL-17 (p < 0.05), compared to their NT counterparts. In
contrast, females at 23 weeks of age did not show such drastic
differences (Figure S2C). These findings suggest that an early
immune skewing induced by maternal peripartum CPZ expo-
sure in IL-10 KO mice contributes to a proinflammatory milieu
that lasts into adulthood.
Peripartum Antibiotic Exposure Induces a Persistent
Maternal and Neonatal Gut Dysbiosis
Examination of 16S rRNA gene copy number, as determined
by qPCR using universal 16S primers, showed a significant
decrease in dams following CPZ exposure as compared to
NT, which recovered by 4 and 8 weeks following CPZ cessation
(Figure 3A). Despite the recovery of 16S gene copy number, the
microbial community structure of dams based on 16S rRNA
gene amplicon sequencing revealed that peripartum adminis-
tration of CPZ caused persistent shifts in the microbiota (Fig-
ures 3B and 3C). The Shannon diversity index was decreased
(Figure 3B), and microbial b-diversity (Figure 3C) did not
recover, even after 8 weeks of CPZ cessation. At the taxonomic
level of phyla shown in Figure S3A, CPZ dramatically reduced
the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes and increased the
relative abundance of Firmicutes and Verrucomicrobia. These
changes, particularly in Bacteroidetes and Verrucomicrobia,
were also observed 4 and 8 weeks following the cessation of
CPZ exposure (Figure S3A). Interestingly, despite the persistent
changes in the maternal gut microbiota, none of the dams
exposed to CPZ developed colitis. This observation suggested
that disruption of the microbial community due to CPZ expo-
sure in adult IL-10 KO mice with already maturated gut micro-
biota may not predispose these animals to develop colitis.
To test this, we treated adult female and male IL-10 KO mice
with CPZ for 4 weeks (identical to IL-10 KO dams) and tracked
their microbial community structure as well as body weight.
Here, we observed no significant differences in survival rate
between NT and CPZ-treated IL-10 KO adults, and both fe-
males and males exhibited a significant increase in body weight
following CPZ exposure (Figure S3B). Contrary to the 16S rRNA
changes observed in IL-10 KO dams, no appreciable differ-
ences were observed with regard to the relative abundance of
Bacteroidetes in adult IL-10 KO mice of either gender following
the cessation of CPZ; however, Verrucomicrobia appeared
to be elevated (Figure S3C). Together, these data suggest
that exposure to CPZ following microbial maturation may be
beyond the window of immune maturation and may not signifi-
cantly impact disease prognosis, even in genetically suscepti-
ble mice.
We next examined the microbial community composition of
pups from NT and CPZ dams at 3, 7, and 11 weeks of age.

The pups from CPZ-exposed dams showed a significantly
lower Shannon diversity index compared to that of pups in

7 and 11 weeks of age in females; p < 0.0001 at 3, 7, and
11 weeks of age in males) (Figure 3E). A persistently low
a-diversity was observed as late as 11 weeks of age in CPZ
pups. At 3 weeks of age, the microbial community composition
differed dramatically between the NT and CPZ groups. How-
ever, each group exhibited community profiles similar to that
of their respective dams. The alterations to the microbiota in
CPZ pups were persistent, showing different patterns of matu-
ration through adulthood (11 weeks of age), 8 weeks post-
exposure to maternal CPZ-induced dysbiois, and at a time
point prior to the onset of inflammation in either group (Figures
3F and S3D).
Exposure to Antibiotics in the Peripartum Period
Induces Persistent and Significant Changes in Gut
Microbiota in IL-10 KO Dams and Offspring
A high-resolution analysis of 16S rRNA gene amplicons using
Minimum Entropy Decomposition (MED) revealed that CPZ
exposure of dams resulted in significant changes in bacterial oli-
gotypes as compared to NT dams at the time of weaning (Fig-
ure 4A, top heatmap). Interestingly, the samples from dams sug-
gest that CPZ exposure leads to persistent changes in specific
oligotypes, even following CPZ cessation, in that little to no re-
covery of oligoypes was observed at 4 or 8 weeks post-treatment
(Figure S4A). We observed specific alterations in oligotype abun-
dance in maternal microbiota of NT versus CPZ-exposed damsat
weaning (3 weeks post-birth; approximately 4 weeks after the
start of CPZ treatment) that were consistent with changes in the
microbiota of the offspring at weaning (3 weeks of age) (Figure 4A,
top and bottom heatmaps). As described, nearly 100% of the
mice that developed either spontaneous colitis or severe DSS-
induced colitis were from CPZ-exposed dams, where dysbiosis
was clearly evident, suggesting that maternal vertical transmis-
sion of specific oligotypes, and not vertical transmission of CPZ
itself, may play a role in colitis development. To rule out a signif-
icant contribution of direct exposure of CPZ to the pups’ micro-
biota via maternal transmission, we performed antimicrobial as-
says using cecal contents from NT versus CPZ-exposed dams
and their respective offspring at weaning. We observed that
only cecal contents from CPZ-exposed dams elicited antimicro-
bial effects against E. coli, while no appreciable killing effect was
observed in NT or CPZ pups, suggesting that maternal transmis-
sion of CPZ was minimal (Figure S4B). Together, these data
provide evidence that maternal CPZ-induced gut microbiota is
vertically transferred to the offspring and does not fully recover,
despite cessation of antibiotic intake.
Further analysis of gut microbes of the offspring from NT or
CPZ-exposed dams at 3, 7, and 11 weeks of age showed persis-
tent dysbiosis over time in CPZ pups (Figure 4A, bottom). The
changes in oligotypes in pups from CPZ-exposed dams per-
sisted well beyond maternal influence in that CPZ pups do not
exhibit recovery at 7 or 11 weeks of age, while oligotypes in NT
pups appear to retain some stability over time (Figure 4A, bottom
heatmap). Pups from CPZ-exposed dams showed significant al-
terations at 3, 7, and 11 weeks of age in oligotypes belonging to
the phyla Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Verrucomicrobia rela-
tive to age-matched NT controls. Overall, offspring from CPZ-
exposed dams exhibited a decrease in a large portion of oligo-
types assigned to Bacteroidetes across all time points, despite
some evidence for a reemergence of several of these oligotypes,
along with several others belonging to both Firmicutes and Ver-
rucomicrobia at 11 weeks of age. Oligotypes across all samples
visualized in the heatmap can be further explored in depth at
https://anvi-server.org/merenlab/il10ko_peripartum_cpz.
At each time point, significant differences were observed in the
relative abundance of particular oligotypes between offspring
from NT versus CPZ-exposed dams. To determine which oligo-
types were the most significant contributors to the overall differ-
ences between NT and CPZ microbial communities, we utilized
the Statistical Analysis of Metagenomic Profiles (STAMP) to
identify significantly enriched oligotypes. The top ten oligotypes
exhibiting the greatest differences in mean relative abundance
among females and males and across all three time points
are shown in Figure 4B. Specifically, at 3 weeks of age, CPZ
males and females exhibited a larger proportion of oligotypes
belonging to the Rickettsiales order from the phyla Proteobacte-
ria, as compared to NT controls. At 7 weeks of age both male
and females from CPZ-exposed dams exhibited a significant
increase in specific Allobaculum sp., Blautia sp., Turicibacter
sp., Lactobacillus sp., and Anaeroplasma sp. oligotypes. By
11 weeks of age, Akkermansia sp. and Blautia sp. were signifi-
cantly elevated in female and male CPZ offspring as compared
to NT. Furthermore, analysis of the male offspring from CPZ-
exposed dams at 3 and 11 weeks of age showed unique oligo-
type signatures from those mice that eventually developed spon-
taneous colitis as compared to mice that remained healthy.
These oligotypes that are significantly different are presented
in Figure 4C and include bacteria belonging to the order Bacter-
oidales at both 3 and 11 weeks of age.

 FMT of Maternal CPZ-Induced Dysbiosis into GF IL-10
KO Dams Elicits a Pro-inflammatory Milieu in Offspring
We next examined whether CPZ-induced dysbiosis observed
in dams would transfer an inflammatory phenotype in the
absence of CPZ exposure. Here, we performed FMT using stool
obtained from NT or CPZ-exposed dams at weaning into GF
IL-10 KO females maintained in separate flexible film isolators
(Figure 5A). Following FMT, these mice were set up into breeding
pairs. Examination of dams and pups at the time of weaning
revealed identical 16S rRNA gene copy numbers as measured
by qPCR in recipients regardless of donor treatment (Fig-
ure 5B). Analysis of 16S rRNA amplicons via MED showed
that dams, female pups, and male pups within the FMT-CPZ
group
exhibited
significant
decreases
in
Firmicutes,
with
concomitant increases in Verrucomicrobia relative to FMT-NT
(Figure 5C). Slight but insignificant changes in Bacteroidetes
were observed only in dams and male FMT-CPZ pups (Fig-
ure 5C). Significant changes were not observed in other phyla
between FMT-NT and FMT-CPZ dams and pups (Figures S5A
and S5B). At 3 weeks of age, we examined similar immune
parameters in FMT pups as shown in specific-pathogen-free
(SPF) IL-10 pups from NT or CPZ-exposed dams in Figure 2.
Male FMT-CPZ pups exhibited significantly increased expres-
sion of Ifng and Il17a in MLNs relative to FMT-NT and increased
but not significant trends of Il17f and Il6 (Figure 5D). Similar ob-
servations were also seen in female FMT-CPZ 3-week-old pups
(Figure S5C). We next examined markers of T cell populations in
FMT-NT and FMT-CPZ 3-week-old pups via flow cytometry.
Again, we determined the proportion of T cells expressing tran-
scription factors, including Foxp3, T-bet, and RORgt in the MLN
and colonic LP, focusing on CD4+ T cell populations (Figure S2F).
We observed that FMT-CPZ male IL-10 KO pups exhibited a sig-
nificant reduction in Tregs in both the MLN (p < 0.01) and colonic
LP (p < 0.05), with increases, although not significant, in Th1 and
Th17 cells in the MLN and LP, as compared to FMT-NT counter-
parts (Figure 5E). Interestingly, FMT-CPZ female IL-10 KO pups
exhibited no significant differences in MLN or LP proportions
of Tregs; however, both Th1 and Th17 cells were significantly
increased in the MLN (p < 0.05) (Figure S5D). To rule out the
direct impact of CPZ on these immune parameters, we analyzed
3-week-old pups from GF IL-10 dams that had or had not
received peripartum CPZ in a manner identical to that presented
in Figure 1A. Analysis of the proportion of T cells expressing
Foxp3, T-bet, or RORgt showed that they were not significantly
altered by maternal exposure to CPZ under GF conditions
(Figure S5E), suggesting that exposure to maternal dysbiosis
induced by CPZ under SPF conditions in early life served as
the main driver of changes.
DISCUSSION
The findings of this study support a potential role of broad-spec-
trum antibiotics as a risk factor for IBD when used during the
peripartum period. While this possibility has been entertained
by several retrospective human studies, a clear causal link be-
tween peripartum antibiotics and IBD risk has never been proven
(Gevers et al., 2014; Hviid et al., 2011; Kronman et al., 2012; Un-
garo et al., 2014; Virta et al., 2012). Using a genetic risk model,
the IL-10 KO mouse, and using a prospective study design
that rigorously controls for starting gut microbiomes and gener-
ational drift, we were able to observe the impact of CPZ, a broad-
spectrum antibiotic, on maternal and offspring gut microbiota
during and after antibiotic exposure. Our data indicate that peri-
partum CPZ exposure of dams causes gut microbial dysbiosis in
dams, which is vertically transmitted to the offspring and is still
evident following cessation of CPZ exposure. These changes
were associated with a skewing of the immune profile in IL-10
KO pups from dams exposed to peripartum CPZ, rendering
them at higher risk for the development of spontaneous and
DSS-induced colitis later in life.
We designed our study to follow a common practice scenario
in humans where antibiotics are used widely among late-term
pregnancies and during the neonatal period. By using a care-
fully designed bedding transfer protocol, we ensured that the
various treatment groups had similar starting microbiomes
and, by using a model of sequential parturitions, we controlled
for generational drift in microbiota. Finally, we used MED to
characterize the microbial community structure at high resolu-
tion. The impact of CPZ-induced perturbations in maternal
microbiota on the development of offspring gut dysbiosis is
particularly notable, as the changes in respective taxa over
time were similar, except more pronounced in the offspring.
We speculate that the severe gut dysbiosis observed in the
offspring of CPZ-exposed dams stems from the antibiotic-
induced selective pressure on maternal microbiota that re-
duces the abundance, diversity, and likelihood of susceptible
organisms to establish in the neonate. The CPZ-induced
changes in maternal gut microbiota show that Bacteroidetes
are significantly reduced at the time of CPZ cessation, which
persists in the dams up to 8 weeks after cessation of the anti-
biotic (Figure S3A). However, these changes did not occur to
the same extreme as to those observed in offspring, perhaps
indicative of a greater resilience of a mature adult gut micro-
biota to
broad-spectrum
antibiotics.
Consistent with
this
notion, dams were only exposed to CPZ during adulthood,
and none developed colitis. We further showed that exposure
of both male and female IL-10 KO mice in adulthood failed to
produce the same degree of dysbiosis and also did not result
in colitis. In contrast, neonates that acquired microbes from
maternal antibiotic-induced gut dysbiosis during this critical
window of microbial assemblage displayed a dysbiotic gut mi-
crobiome from the very start, which was associated with imme-
diate and long-term skewing of their immune system.
As shown in Figure 4, it is striking to see the near absence
of most members of the Bacteroidetes phylum and the
elevated abundance of members of the Firmicutes phylum

 at 3 (weaning) and 7 weeks of age (4 weeks post-exposure
to maternal CPZ-induced dysbiosis). We attribute the nadir
of Bacteroidetes at 7 weeks of age to the possibility that
other more fit groups (Firmicutes and Verrucomicrobia) devel-
oped stable networks that limited the ability of Bacteroidetes
to establish (Figure S3D). By 11 weeks of age, we observe
some appearance of Bacteroidetes taxa, but their diversity
remained limited. This gut dysbiosis persisted to adulthood
(11 weeks of age), even before frank colitis was observed
in any of the groups. Additionally, we identified oligotypes
that appeared to be significant contributors to the overall
differences observed between NT and CPZ groups, as well
as among CPZ male pups that did or did not develop
colitis (Figure 4). Furthermore, FMT of maternal CPZ-induced
communities into GF IL-10 KO mice resulted in immune skew-
ing in these offspring that was consistent with that observed
in SPF IL-10 KO pups exposed to maternal CPZ-induced
dysbiosis. This reveals that maternal CPZ-induced dysbiosis
alone in the absence of direct exposure to CPZ can elicit a
negative impact on immunological outcomes and possibly
further predispose genetically susceptible offspring to develop
colitis. Future studies involving shotgun metagenomics should
provide additional insights into maternal-offspring influences,
host disease development, and potential predictive markers
of risk.
The maternal CPZ-induced gut dysbiosis transmitted to the
offspring is associated with disruptions in immune development
and protective processes that would normally occur at the time
of weaning to adulthood (Figure 2). The increased mRNA expres-
sion of Il4 and Il13 implied the possibility that Th2-mediated
mechanisms, including invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells,
may play a role in the development of colitis, as previously
reported (Olszak et al., 2012). However, in our model, plasma
IgE was not significantly altered by maternal CPZ exposure (Fig-
ure S2D); hence, we focused on Th1 and Th17 cells, which have
been shown to be relevant in the IL-10 KO mouse (Keubler et al.,
2015). While we observed significant increases specifically in
Th17 RORyt cells, previous work in WT C57BL/6 mice from
dams experiencing repeat exposure to subtherapeutic doses
of penicillin exhibited decreases in IL-17 and IFN-g T cell popu-
lations. However, in our model, genetically susceptible hosts
such as the IL-10 KO mouse respond in a different manner rela-
tive to WT mice, resulting in a relatively increased risk for ‘‘spon-
taneous’’ colitis, as was observed (Figure 1). It is notable that this
risk continues to exist for mice that do not develop frank sponta-
neous colitis, as these mice exhibited increased histological and
subclinical mucosal inflammation and were highly susceptible to
the colitogenic effects of DSS compared to NT controls. These
findings are likely relevant to human IBD where genetic risk,
while necessary, is, by itself, insufficient to cause frank disease.
It is also possible that a significant number of these at-risk sub-
jects have subclinical disease that would be detectable histolog-
ically or through examination of immune/inflammatory markers,
which has been previously suggested (Howarth et al., 2002;
Sakata et al., 2001). Moreover, these individuals are likely to be
more sensitive to risk factors that set the stage for events that
trigger the immune response to cause frank clinical disease.
We speculate that this may involve improper imprinting of
immune networks of genetically susceptible individuals created
by the gut dysbiosis caused through peripartum antibiotic
exposure.
In summary, our studies provide compelling evidence that
peripartum maternal antibiotic exposure skews maternal gut mi-
crobiota, and that of the subsequent offspring, and increases
IBD risk in genetically susceptible offspring by affecting a critical
stage of their microbial and immune development. These effects
can be persistent into adulthood and promote the risk of com-
plex immune disorders such as IBD in genetically susceptible
hosts. Identification of potential risk factors and a better under-
standing of the underlying mechanisms that lead to increased
IBD risk is paramount for developing strategies for the prevention
and/or treatment of human IBD. In this case, we may have to
rethink common practices of indiscriminate and empirical use
of antibiotics during pregnancy and infancy and perhaps give
thought to the development of microbial and host metrics that
can assess states of host-microbe interactions so that course
corrections can be made to promote good health.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Animals
GF IL-10 KO mice on a C57BL/6J genetic background were bred in the Univer-
sity of Chicago Gnotobiotic Research Animal Facility (GRAF) and FMT (con-
ventionalized) with Helicobacter hepaticus-free microbiota (kindly provided
by Dr. Cathryn Nagler, University of Chicago), as previously described (Gillil-
land et al., 2012). Following conventionalization, these SPF IL-10 KO breeding
pairs were bred in house under H. hepaticus-free conditions (University of Chi-
cago Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee [IACUC] protocol 71084).
Five initial breeding pairs were prepared, and their progeny were transferred
to bedding to normalize gut microbes. Bedding was mixed at 4 days and
9 days following cage changes every 2 weeks until breeding was initiated.
Following this normalization procedure, ten breeding pairs were prepared to
obtain two parturitions for NT and CPZ-treatment groups (Figure 1A). In
cohort 1, the first and second litters were used as NT controls or the CPZ
group, respectively. In cohort 2, the first and second litters were used as NT
controls. Wild-type C57BL/6J mice underwent the same breeding, microbial
normalization, and CPZ treatment protocol for comparison.
Antibiotic Treatment
CPZ sodium salt was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. CPZ (0.5 mg/mL) was
administered in drinking water beginning at the third week of gestation until
weaning of pups (Figure S1A). Mice had free access to water throughout the
treatment period (University of Chicago IACUC protocol 72101). The same
dose of CPZ was administered to adult IL-10 KO mice between 12 and 20
(18.9 ± 2.9) weeks of age for 4 weeks.
Clinical Evaluation of Spontaneous Colitis
Body weights of mice in cohorts 1 and 2 were measured weekly beginning
at weaning. The euthanasia criteria for spontaneous colitis included rectal
prolapse; more than 15% body weight loss; or signs of pain/distress, including
poor grooming, decreased activity, and hunched posture (Hale and Greer,
2012).
DSS-Induced Colitis
Mice were given 2.5% DSS (36–50 kDa) (MP Biomedicals) in drinking water for
10 days (IACUC protocol 72101). All mice were weighed and monitored daily.
Mice exhibiting more than 20% body weight loss were euthanized.
FMT in GF IL-10 KO Mice
Fecal samples collected from NT and CPZ-exposed dams at weaning were
used to gavage FMT of 200 mL fecal supernatant (100 mg feces per 1 mL sterile
Cell Reports 20, 491–504, July 11, 2017
501
 PBS) into GF IL-10 KO female recipients maintained in separate flexible film
isolators (see model in Figure 5A). NT and CPZ-FMT females were paired
with GF IL-10 KO males for breeding. Pups were utilized for flow cytometry
and qPCR analysis at 3 weeks of age (weaning). Fecal pellets were collected
from dams and offspring for microbial analysis.
Histological Analysis
Colon samples were fixed in 4% formaldehyde and embedded in paraffin
followed by H&E staining. Colitis histological score for colitis was used as
previously described (Erben et al., 2014).
Fecal DNA Extraction and 16S rRNA Gene Amplicon Analysis
Fecal samples of tracked offspring in cohort 1 were harvested and rapidly
frozen at �80�C at 3 7, 11, and 23 weeks of age. DNA was extracted
as previously described (Wang et al., 2009), and the V4-V5 region of the
16S rRNA gene was amplified following Earth Microbiome Project (EMP)
protocols
(http://www.earthmicrobiome.org/emp-standard-protocols/16s/).
Sequencing was performed on an Illumina MiSeq sequencer at the
High-Throughput Genome Analysis Core, Argonne National Laboratory.
Raw
sequencing
data were
de-multiplexed, and partially
overlapping
paired-end reads were merged using illumina-utils (Eren et al., 2013b). Mis-
matches at the overlapping regions of pairs were resolved using the base
with the higher Q score, and the merged sequences were kept for down-
stream analyses only (1) if they contained up to three mismatches at the
overlapping region, and (2) if 66% of the bases in the first half of each
read had an average Q score of 30. The quality filtered reads were parti-
tioned into ecologically relevant units using MED (Eren et al., 2015b) with
default parameters. Using Shannon entropy, MED resolves a given amplicon
dataset iteratively into high-resolution oligotypes (Eren et al., 2013a). Taxon-
omy was assigned to oligotypes using GAST (Huse et al., 2008), and Anvi’o
v2.3.1 (Eren et al., 2015a) was used to visualize the relative abundance
of each oligotype across samples in the context of metadata. Oligotype com-
munity data were normalized, and taxonomic relative abundances in NT and
CPZ groups were compared for females and males separately at each time
point. Oligotypes with significant differences between NT and CPZ commu-
nities were filtered for oligotypes with greater than 10-fold changes in relative
abundance, and then further filtered for the top ten oligotypes exhibiting the
greatest difference in mean relative abundance. Extended error plots were
created using a statistical analysis of taxonomic and functional profiles
(STAMP, v2.1.3) (Parks et al., 2014).
Statistical Analysis
Spontaneous and DSS-induced colitis incidence by NT or CPZ treatment was
estimated by ‘‘survival analysis,’’ performed using log-rank test followed by
Kaplan-Meyer plot. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare body
weights, histological scores, T cell populations, mRNA expression levels, pro-
tein levels, or 16S rRNA gene copy number between the NT and CPZ groups.
The Kruskal-Wallis test and Dunn’s test were also used for 16S rRNA gene
copy number. These tests were performed with GraphPad Prism (GraphPad
Software). Statistical significance was assumed when p G 0.05. Raw counts
of oligotypes were normalized using the ‘‘decostand’’ function implemented
in the R/CRAN package ‘‘vegan.’’ Alpha diversity via the Shannon diversity in-
dex was computed using the ‘‘diversity’’ function implemented in the ‘‘vegan’’
package. Student’s t test was used to compare oligotype enrichment at 3, 7,
and 11 weeks of age between IL-10 KO pups from NT and CPZ-exposed dams
and between male pups from CPZ-exposed dams that eventually developed
spontaneous colitis and male pups that remained healthy. The p values were
adjusted for multiple test using the Benjamini-Hochberg method (Benjamini
and Hochberg, 1995). The criterion of significance was set at a false discovery
rate (FDR) <0.05.
