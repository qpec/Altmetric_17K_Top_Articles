Serotonin has widespread, but computationally obscure, modulatory effects on learning and
cognition. Here, we studied the impact of optogenetic stimulation of dorsal raphe serotonin
neurons in mice performing a non-stationary, reward-driven decision-making task. Animals
showed two distinct choice strategies. Choices after short inter-trial-intervals (ITIs) depen-
ded only on the last trial outcome and followed a win-stay-lose-switch pattern. In contrast,
choices after long ITIs reflected outcome history over multiple trials, as described by rein-
forcement learning models. We found that optogenetic stimulation during a trial significantly
boosted the rate of learning that occurred due to the outcome of that trial, but these effects
were only exhibited on choices after long ITIs. This suggests that serotonin neurons modulate
reinforcement learning rates, and that this influence is masked by alternate, unaffected,
decision mechanisms. These results provide insight into the role of serotonin in treating
psychiatric disorders, particularly its modulation of neural plasticity and learning.

earning from the outcomes of past actions is crucial for
effective decision-making and thus ultimately for survival. In
the case of important outcomes, such as rewards, ascending
neuromodulatory systems have been implicated in aspects of this
learning due to their pervasive effects on processing and plasti-
city. Of these systems, perhaps best understood is the involve-
ment of phasically fluctuating levels of dopamine activity and
release in signaling the so-called temporal difference1 prediction
errors (mismatches between outcomes and predictions) for
appetitive outcomes2,3. Since prediction errors are a key com-
ponent of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, this research
has underpinned and inspired a large body of theory on the
neural implementation of RL.
From the early days of investigations into aversive processing
in Aplysia4, serotonin (5-HT) has also been implicated in plas-
ticity. This is broadly evident in the mammalian brain, from the
restoration of the critical period for the visual system of rodents
occasioned by local infusion of 5-HT5 to the impairment of
particular aspects of associative learning arising from 5-HT
depletion in monkeys6,7. Despite theoretical suggestions for an
association with aversive learning8–12, direct experimental tests
into serotonin’s role in RL tasks have led to a complex pattern of
results13–18. For instance, recent optogenetic studies reporting
that stimulating 5-HT neurons could lead to positive reinforce-
ment15 do not appear to be consistent with other optogenetic
findings, which instead suggest an involvement in patience16,17,19
and even locomotion18.
Here, we study a different aspect of the involvement of 5-HT in
RL. Although prediction errors are necessary signals for learning,
they are not sufficient. This is because there is flexibility in setting
the learning rate, i.e., the amount by which an agent should update
a prediction based on such errors. The learning rate determines
the timescale (e.g., how many trials) over which reward histories
are integrated to assess the value of taken actions, and it is
naturally associated with neural plasticity (e.g., refs. 20–23). 5-HT
can readily influence learning rates through its interaction with
dopamine24; and indeed, there is evidence that animals adapt the
timescales of plasticity to the prevailing circumstances23,25–28, and
also consider more than one timescale simultaneously29–32. Thus,
5-HT could be involved in some, but not other, timescales for
learning. It could also be associated with some, but not other, of
the many decision-making systems33–36 that are known to be
involved in RL.
We therefore reanalyzed experiments in which mice performed
a partially self-paced, dynamic foraging task for water rewards17.
In this task, 5-HT neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN)
were optogenetically activated during reward delivery in a trial-
selective manner. The precise control of the timing and location
of stimulation offered the potential of studying in detail the way
in which 5-HT affects reward valuation and choice. We used
methods of computational model comparison to examine these
various possible influences. We first noted a substantial difference
in the control of actions that followed short and long intertrial
intervals: only the latter was influenced by extended reward his-
tories, as expected for choices driven by conventional RL. We
then found that the learning rate associated with these (latter)
choices was significantly increased by stimulations of DRN 5-HT
neurons.
Results
Animals showed a wide distribution of inter-trial-intervals. We
reanalyzed data from a dynamic foraging or probabilistic choice
task in which subjects faced a two-armed bandit17. Full experi-
mental methods are given in the “Methods” section and in ref. 17.
Briefly, the subjects were four adult transgenic mice expressing
CRE recombinase under the serotonin transporter promoter
(SERT-Cre37) and four wild-type littermates (WT)17. In this task
(Fig. 1a), mice were required to poke the center port to initiate a
trial. They were then free to choose between two side ports, where
reward was delivered probabilistically at both ports on each trial
(on a concurrent variable-ratio-with-hold schedule38). On a
subset of trials, when mice entered a side port, 1 s of photo-
stimulation was provided to DRN 5-HT neurons via an
implanted optical fiber (Fig. 1b). ChR2-YFP expression was his-
tologically confirmed to be localized to the DRN in SERT-Cre
mice (Fig. 1c)17.
Following previous experiments in macaque monkeys29,38,39,
the probability that a reward is associated with a side port per trial
was fixed in a given block of trials (left vs right probabilities: 0.4
vs 0.1, or 0.1 vs 0.4). Once a reward had been associated with a
side port, the reward remained available until collection (although
multiple rewards did not accumulate). Photo-stimulation was
always delivered at one of the side ports in a given block (left vs
right probabilities: 1 vs 0, or 0 vs 1). Block changes occurred every
50–150 trials and were not signaled, meaning that animals needed
to track the history of rewards in order to maximize rewards.
As previously reported17, subject’s choices tended to follow
changes in reward contingencies (Fig. 1d), exhibiting a form of
matching behavior29,38,39. A deterministic form of matching
behavior can maximize average rewards in this task32,40–42
because the probability of getting a reward increases on a side
as the other side is exploited (due to the holding of rewards). For
more behaviorally realizable policies, slow learning of reward
contingencies has been shown to be beneficial to increase the
chance of obtaining rewards32.
We confirmed the results of previous analyses17 showing that
the optogenetic stimulation of DRN neurons did not appear to
change the average preference of the side ports (Fig. 1e). The
animals’ preference for the side port that was associated with a
higher water probability was not affected by the side which was
photo-stimulated. However, these analyses do not fully take
advantage of the experimental design in which photo-stimulation
was delivered on a trial-by-trial basis. This should allow us to
examine whether the effect of stimulation is more prominent on a
specific subset of trials.
Duration of preceding ITI determined decision strategy. The
task contained a free operant component in that the subjects were
free to initiate each trial. This resulted in a wide distribution of
inter-trial-intervals (ITIs). It was notable that some ITIs were
substantially larger than others (Fig. 1f; see also Supplementary
Figs. 1 and 2). To quantify this effect, we separated short from
long ITI trials using a threshold of 7 s (we consider other
thresholds below; values greater than 4 s led to equivalent results;
we set this threshold as a free parameter in our computational
model analysis).
Supplementary Figure 3 reports the mean proportions of long
ITI trials in WT and SERT-Cre mice. The frequency of long ITI
trials was slightly, but statistically significantly, different between
WT and SERT; however, this appears not to be due to stimulation
itself, as control analysis showed that stimulation itself did not
significantly change the ITI that followed (Supplementary Fig. 4).
We also found that long ITI trials were most common in the last
part of each experimental session, but were also seen in earlier
parts of each session (Supplementary Fig. 5).
Previous studies have suggested a relationship between the
duration of an ITI and the nature of the subsequent choice. For
example, subjects have been reported to make more impulsive
choices after shorter ITI43. Another study has shown that
perceptual decisions are more strongly influenced by more

 venerable prior experience when working memory was disturbed
during the task44. Here, we hypothesized that choices following
short ITIs might also be more strongly influenced by the most
recent choice outcome compared to those following long ITIs,
since, for example, the outcome preceding a short ITI is more
likely to be kept in working memory until the time of choice.
To investigate this, we first exploited an existing model of the
behavior on this task17,38. This is a variant of an RL model which
separately integrates reward and choice history over past trials,
subject to exponential decay38. This model captures a form of
win-stay, lose-shift rule45,46 when time constants are small.
We found that choices following short ITIs (ITIs < 7 s) were
well predicted by this previously validated model (see “Methods”
for details) (Fig. 1g). Further, the time constants of the model
were indeed very short (reward kernel: 1.4 trials for WT and 1.9
trials for SERT-Cre mice; choice kernel: 1.3 trials for WT and 1.2
trials for SERT-Cre mice). This suggests choices followed a form
of win-stay, lose-shift rule45,46. The difference of the reward time
constant between WT and SERT-Cre mice was significant (p <
0.01, permutation test) but very small (<1 trial), while the choice
time constant was not. This paltry difference in reward time
constant suggests a slightly smaller learning rate for the SERT-Cre
mice, since the learning rate is inversely proportional to the time
constant.
However, choices following long ITIs (ITIs > 7 s) were not well
predicted by the same model when fitting the model to all trials
(Fig. 1g), suggesting that choices following short ITIs and long
ITIs are qualitatively different. This is also evident from our
additional parametric analysis showing that predictive accuracy of
the win-stay lose-switch strategy dramatically decreased as ITIs
lengthened (Supplementary Fig. 6). This did not depend on
whether long ITI trials were in the beginning of, or in the last part
of, each experimental session (Supplementary Fig. 7; being at, or
slightly below, chance). These results also suggest that choices
following long ITIs cannot be accounted for by a short-term
memory-based win-stay lose-switch strategy.
We hypothesized that choices following long ITIs might reflect
slow learning of reward history over many trials32,47. We first fit
the same kernel model only to choices following long ITIs, by
allowing the model to learn over all trials but maximizing the
likelihood only from the choices following long ITIs. We found
that the model could now well predict choices following long
ITIs, while failing to account for choices following short ITI
(Supplementary Fig. 8). Further, the time constants of the model
were now very long (reward kernel: 91 trials for WT and 59 trials
for SERT-Cre mice; choice kernel: 100 trials for WT and 143 trials
for SERT-Cre mice). This supports the idea that choice following
long ITIs were driven by slow learning of outcomes over many
trials. We should note, however, that the difference between the
choice and reward kernels becomes somewhat obscure over this
timescale, since the reward and choice histories are strongly
correlated over the long run. Thus, one should take this result as
inspiration, and be cautious about interpreting the precise
parameter values.
We then looked for the best model that can describe choice
following long ITIs. As noted above, the kernel model is likely to
have a redundant structure for slow learning. Indeed, by
complexity-adjusted model comparison (integrated BIC)48,49,
we found that choices following ITIs > 7 s were best described
by a standard RL model (Supplementary Fig. 9). This analysis
again supports our hypothesis that choices following long ITIs are
influenced by a relatively long period of reward history compared
to choices following short ITIs. It is also worth noting that in
contrast to the short ITI model, in which memory decays rapidly
every trial regardless of choice, the standard RL model does not
change the value of an option as long as the option is not selected.

Fig. 1 Task and behavior. a The task. On each trial, a mouse was required to enter the center port (Trial initiation) and then move to one of the side ports
(Choice). A reward might be delivered at the side port according to a reward schedule. The next trial started when the mouse entered the center port. The
inter-trial-interval (ITI) is defined as the time from when the mouse left the side port until it entered the center port to initiate the next trial. In a given block
of trials, one side port was associated with a higher reward probability per trial (0.4) than the other (0.1), while photo-stimulation was always delivered at
one of the side ports. b A schematic of the optogenetic stimulation. In SERT-Cre mice, 5-HT neurons expressed ChR2-YFP (green) and could be

 This difference in models could suggest that different memory
mechanisms may be involved in the decisions following short and
long ITIs (e.g., working memory for short ITIs, longer memory
for long ITIs35).
Enhanced learning from DRN stimulation. Given our original
hypothesis that serotonin modulates the RL learning rate, we
predicted that optogenetic stimulation of DRN 5-HT neurons
would have a stronger impact on future choices that follow long
ITIs, since those choices appear to be more sensitive to learning
over long trial sequences.
To test this, we first conducted the model-agnostic analysis
described schematically in Fig. 2a. To assess how reward history
with or without photo-stimulation affected choice following long
ITIs, we estimated correlations between the temporal evolution of
the reward bias and the choice bias. Importantly, we estimated the
reward bias on trials preceded by ITIs of any length, but
separately for trials with or without photo-stimulation, while the
choice bias was estimated on trials preceded by long ITIs,
regardless of the presence of reward or photo-stimulation.
As seen in Fig. 2b, we found significant correlations between
reward and choice bias for all conditions. Importantly, there was
a significant effect of photo-stimulation on the magnitude of the
correlation. That is, for the SERT-Cre mice, the correlation was
larger when reward
bias was estimated
from trials
with
stimulation than when it was estimated from trials without
stimulation. This suggests that optogenetic stimulation of DRN 5-
HT neurons modulated learning about reward history (indepen-
dent of the ITI on the learning trial), which in turn affected future
choices on trials that followed long ITIs.
The equivalent analysis for choices following short ITIs
(Supplementary Fig. 10) showed that they were not affected by
photo-stimulation. Indeed, a direct comparison between choices
following
short
and
long
ITI conditions
shows
that the
stimulation had a larger impact on reward learning for choices
following long ITIs than for choices following short ITIs in SERT-
Cre
mice,
while
there
was
no
difference
in
WT
mice
(Supplementary Fig. 11).
In addition, in the absence of photo-stimulation during reward
deliveries, the correlation was smaller for the SERT-Cre mice than
the WT mice (Fig. 2b). This could indicate a chronic effect of
stimulation18, or a baseline effect of the genetic constructs, in
addition to the trial-by-trial effect.
Faster reinforcement learning from DRN stimulation. Our
analysis so far suggests that choices following short ITIs are
captured by a relatively simple win-stay lose-shift rule, while
choices following long ITIs reflect a more gradual learning about
reward and choice histories over multiple trials. Furthermore, we
showed that optogenetic stimulation of 5-HT neurons at reward
deliveries influenced the impact of those rewards on future
choices following long, but not short, ITIs.

Fig. 2 Enhanced learning from DRN stimulation. a Schematic diagram of the model-agnostic analysis. The correlation between the recent reward bias
(window = 10 trials) and choices following long ITIs (window = 5 trials) was estimated using adjacent sliding windows. The reward bias was estimated on
trials only with (top) or without (bottom) photo-stimulation, but regardless of the duration of ITIs. The choice bias was estimated only for choices following
long ITIs, regardless of the presence of stimulation or reward. The grayed out trials in this example were ignored for the assessments. The windows were
shifted together one trial at a time. For each realization of the sliding windows, the reward and adjacent choice biases were estimated. However, we
excluded cases in which the choice window contained no long ITI trials. By sliding these windows, we obtained many pairs of reward bias and choice bias.
We then estimated Pearson’s correlation from these points, separately for each mouse. Note that, due to the task design in which photo-stimulation is
associated with only one side (left or right) in a given block, in some moving windows reward bias had to be computed from one side only. Thus, we
assigned +1 (respectively −1) to a reward from left (right) and no-reward from right (left) when we computed reward bias. We are aware that this is not a
perfect measure for reward bias; but we still expect finite correlations since reward rates from the left choice and the right choice are on average negatively
correlated by the task design in a given block (reward probability: 0.1 vs 0.4). b Model-agnostic analysis suggests that the impact of reward history on
choices following long ITIs was modulated by optogenetic stimulation. The x-axis indicates if the reward bias was computed over trials with or without
photo-stimulations. The stars indicate how significantly the correlation is different from zero, or the correlations are different from each other, tested by a
permutation test, where estimated reward bias was permuted within or between conditions. Three stars indicates p < 0.001. The error bars indicate the

 In order to understand these findings in a more integrated way,
we built a combined characterization of choice. Figure 3a depicts
a model in which there is an ITI threshold (now treated as a free
parameter rather than being set to 7 s) arbitrating whether the
previously validated
two-kernel
model17,38 (i.e.,
short-term
memory-based win-stay lose-switch model), or a longer-term
reinforcement learning (RL) model50 would determine choice.
The RL model allowed for two different learning rates associated
with the prediction error on a given trial (Fig. 3b): αStim (for
stimulated
trials)
and
αNo-Stim
(for
non-stimulated
ones).
Importantly, both of the mechanisms learned values in parallel
every trial; but choices were generated by one of the mechanisms
according to the duration of the preceding ITI, where the ITI
threshold was a free parameter that was fit to the data.
This model well predicts choices following short and long ITIs
(Supplementary Figs. 12 and 13). We also found that this model
fits the data more proficiently than a number of variants (see the
“Methods” section for details) embodying a range of different
potential effects of optogenetic stimulation. This includes acting
as a direct reward itself; as a multiplicative boost to any real

Fig. 3 DRN 5-HT stimulation increased the learning rate of SERT-Cre mice. a Schematics of the computational model. There are two separate decision-
making systems: a fast system generating a form of “win-stay, lose-switch,” and a slow system following reinforcement learning (RL). After short ITIs (TITI
< TThreshold), choice is generated by the fast system following win-stay, lose-switch. After long ITIs (TITI > TThreshold), choice is generated by the slow RL
system. The ITI threshold TThreshold is a free parameter that is fitted to data. b The RL system is assumed to learn the value of choice on all trials, including
those with short ITIs for whose choices it was not responsible. The learning rate of the RL system is allowed to be modulated by photo-stimulation. When
photo-stimulation is (respectively, is not) delivered, choice value is updated at the rate of αStim (αno-Stim). The error bars indicate the mean ± SEM of
sessions (n = 32). c Photo-stimulation increased the learning rate of SERT-Cre mice. The estimated learning rates for the WT (left), SERT-Cre (center), and
SERT-Cre mice with shuffled stimulations (right) are shown. The difference between αStim and αno-Stim in WT mice, between αStim in WT mice and αStim in
SERT-Cre mice, between αStim and αno-Stim in SERT-Cre mice with shuffled stimulation conditions, and between αStim in SERT-Cre mice and αStim in SERT-
Cre mice with shuffled stimulation (right) conditions were not significant. The difference between αStim and αno-Stim in SERT-Cre mice, and between αno-Stim
in WT and αno-Stim in SERT-Cre mice were significant (permutation test, p < 0.001). The difference between αno−Stim in SERT-Cre mice and αno−Stim in

 reward; or causing a change in the learning and/or forgetting
rates (Supplementary Fig. 14).
One might wonder if the behavior could be better accounted
for by a model specifying forgetting as a function of elapsed time,
including the ITIs. To test this, we constructed a model that
learns and forgets outcome history according to wall-clock time
(measured in seconds) rather than according to the number of
trials. For this, we simply adapted the previously validated two-
kernel model that integrates choice and reward history over
trials17,38
such
that

the factual timing of the experiments. Our model comparison
analysis using WT mice, however, substantially favored the
account
of

model
in
Fig.
3a
(Δ
iBIC = 218).
Introducing two time constants to the reward integration kernel
did not change this conclusion.
In the best fitting model (Fig. 3a), we found that optogenetic
stimulation increased the learning rate on stimulated trials in
SERT-Cre mice, but not in WT mice (Fig. 3c). Consistent with
the previous analyses, we also found that the time constants for
the choice kernel and the reward kernel for choices following
short ITIs were very short for both WT and SERT-Cre mice
(Supplementary Fig. 15), and that the ITI thresholds were not
significantly different between WT and SERT-Cre mice (Supple-
mentary Fig. 16). In addition, we replicated the same results using
a model with a fixed (=7 s) ITI threshold (Supplementary
Fig. 17).
As a control analysis, we fitted the model to SERT-Cre data
with randomly re-assigned stimulation trials. Shuffling the trials
abolished the effect of photo-stimulation on the learning rate
(Fig. 3c), supporting the hypothesis that the modulation of
learning rates was caused by stimulation of DRN serotonin
neurons.
Although the learning rate on stimulation trials in SERT-Cre
mice was significantly greater than that on non-stimulated trials,
it was not significantly different from the learning rate in WT
mice (Fig. 3c), as already hinted by the model-agnostic analysis
(Fig. 2b).
Finally, we performed a generative test of the model to assess
its ability to capture key aspects of the data. To do this, we
simulated our model 100 times using each collection of
parameters fit to each session of each subject, and analyzed
generated data using the model-agnostic procedures adopted for
the original data (shown in Fig. 2b). We used the ITIs from the
real data in determining which trial was preceded by a long or a
short ITI when simulating choices from the model. The ITI
threshold was given by the model. Consistent with the real data,
the simulated data also showed a significant correlation between
reward history and the choice after long ITIs, and a significant
difference between photo-stimulation and no photo-stimulation
conditions between WT and SERT-Cre mice (Fig. 3d).
Our analysis has so far focused on the impact of reward history
over a relatively short timescale (<50 trials), compared to the
length of a whole experimental session (>500 trials). Since
animals can also learn reward histories over much longer
timescales29,32, and 5-HT neurons have shown to encode reward
rates over multiple timescales51, it is possible that the optogenetic
stimulation of DRN neurons might have had effects over
hundreds of trials. To examine this, we conducted a simple
correlation analysis by dividing each session into five quintiles
(containing
equal
numbers
of
trials)
as
in
Fig.
1d
and
Supplementary Fig. 5, and asked how the choices following long
ITIs in the last quintile (the only one with substantial numbers of
long ITI choices) were correlated with the reward history
stretched over all numbers of preceding quintiles (e.g., only the
fifth, the fourth, the fifth, etc.). For reward history, we used the
probabilities determined by the experimenters rather than those
observed by the subjects to avoid any bias that is independent of
the reward history (such as choice history).
Choices following long ITIs were indeed significantly influ-
enced by long run reward history spanning over the entire
experimental session (Supplementary Fig. 18). The data from the
generative test also confirm this correlation (Supplementary
Fig. 18), albeit to a lesser degree, perhaps because the model only
involves a single time constant and may thus have an inflated
learning (and thus forgetting) rate relative to these long gaps.
Furthermore, although the data show that these effects were
stronger in SERT-Cre mice than in WT mice (two-way ANOVA;
p = 0.0016, p = 11.98), we did not see this in our generative test
results. Thus, the longer-time constants (slower learning) that are
present23,29,32 may also be affected by genotype or actual
optogenetic stimulation.
Discussion
There have been many suggestions for the roles that serotonin
might play in decision-making and choice. These include ideas
about influences over motor behavior52, punishment8,53,54,
opponency
with
dopamine10,11,24,
satiation55,
discounting56
patience16,17,19, and even aspects of reward15,51,57. Here, we
report an additional effect: stimulations of DRN 5-HT neurons
can increase the rate at which animals learn from choice out-
comes in dynamic environments.
A standard learning rule in RL has two distinct components.
The first is the reward prediction error (RPE), which quantifies
the difference between the actual and predicted value of out-
comes. The phasic activity2 of midbrain dopamine neurons and
the local concentration of dopamine58,59 in target regions has
shown to follow this pattern. The second component is the
learning rate, which determines how much change is actually
engendered by the prediction error. From a normative perspec-
tive, learning rates are determined by the degree of uncertainty25
—influenced by factors such as initial ignorance and the volatility
of the environment, since we should only learn when there is
something that we do not know. There is experimental evidence
that this is indeed the case in animals and humans26,27,60,61.
While it has been suggested that the neuromodulators nor-
epinephrine (NE) and acetylcholine (ACh) may influence learn-
ing rates28,62, our findings suggest that 5-HT DRN neurons also
play a critical role. The interaction between 5-HT and dopamine
could potentially be implicated in this effect, as various serotonin
receptor types can increase the release of dopamine63, which, if
operating at an appropriate timescale, could boost the effective
learning rate.
It is notable that the effect of altered learning rates was only
apparent in choices on trials following long, but not short, ITIs
(though it is critical to remember that stimulation affected
learning on all stimulated trials regardless of ITIs, but that the
effect of that learning could only be observed on future choices
immediately following long ITIs). The former choices also hewed
to a different strategy than the latter. Short ITIs appeared to lead
to decisions closer to win-stay, lose-shift, meaning that subjects
weighed barely more than the outcome of the most recent trial in
their decision. The shift between strategies might correspond to a
difference between a policy based on working memory35 for very
recent events (a few seconds) vs a plasticity-based mechanism like
that assumed by standard incremental RL for incorporating
events over longer periods. Note, though, that the boundaries
between working memory and RL are becoming somewhat
blurred64. It has been suggested that memory-based methods
contribute to model-based control, by contrast with incremental
model-free RL33,36,64,65; but this remains to be pinned down

 experimentally. Note that a similar effect has been also observed
in perceptual decision-making. In one example, longer-lasting
prior experience was more influential when working memory was
disturbed during the task44.
The distribution of short and long ITI trials suggests that they
might reflect the animal’s motivational state as being high and
low, respectively. Long ITI choices were most frequent in the last
quintile of each experimental session, where animals were likely
to be sated. That they also occurred in the beginning of experi-
mental sessions might suggest that the subjects were not fully
engaged in the task at the start, perhaps hoping to get out from
the experimental chamber. A more systematic analysis of beha-
vior during long ITIs would be required to uncover the nature of
those events.
The fact that only a subset of trials was apparently affected by
the stimulation is arguably a cautionary tale for the interpretation
of optogenetics experiments. What looked like a null effect17 had
to be elucidated through computational modeling. Equally, for
the short ITI trials, what seemed like behavior controlled by
conventional RL, might come from a different computational
strategy (and potentially neural substrate) altogether35. This could
prompt a reexamination of previous data (as shown in ref. 64).
Further caution might be prompted by the observation that the
learning rate in the SERT-Cre mice in the absence of stimulation
was actually significantly lower than that of the WT mice in the
absence of stimulation, rising to a similar magnitude as the WTs,
with stimulation. This may be due to chronic effects of optoge-
netic stimulation of DRN neurons, as suggested in recent
experiments18. For example, SERT-Cre mice may have been less
motivated. Contrary to this, there was no difference in reward
rates (Supplementary Fig. 21), and the stimulation itself did not
change the duration of the subsequent ITI (Supplementary
Fig. 4). Another possibility for this is due to baseline effects of the
genetic constructs.
The learning rates that we found even for the slow system are a
little too fast to capture fully the long-term correlation that can be
found in the data. This is apparent in our additional analysis
showing the correlation between the reward bias in the first
quintile of the trials and the choice bias in the fifth quintile of the
same session (Supplementary Fig. 19), also the correlation
between the reward bias in the fifth quintile of the trials and the
choice bias in the first quintile in the succeeding experimental
session (Supplementary Fig. 20). The former is surprising, since it
spans a large number of trials; the latter because it usually spans
more than a day. This could suggest that learning in fact took
place over a wide range of timescales, and the time constant that
we found by our model fitting reflects a weighted average of those
multiple time constants23,32. It would be interesting to study how
the duration of ITI, or the level of engagement in the task, can
change the weight or relative contribution of those distinctive
time constants. It is plausible that the two decision strategies that
we considered here are just an approximation to a wider collec-
tion of strategies that operate over a wider range of distinctive
timescales. It would then be interesting to ask why stimulations of
DRN 5-HT neurons preferentially affected slower components.
Further questions include whether 5-HT neuron’s effects would
be better captured as an influence on the relative weighting of
different timescales32 rather than the changes in time constants
themselves that we assumed in the model fitting.
Though as a first approximation, we assumed that a hard
threshold separates ITIs for taking one choice strategy from
another on following trials, we expect that this can be improved
upon. For instance, which rule determines choice is presumably
controlled by other variables associated with the subjects’ internal
states, to which we had limited access in our current study. It is
also possible that both decision strategies co-exist on every trial,
but their relative contributions to each ultimate decision are
determined by some rules, as suggested for the integration of so-
called model-based and model-free RL strategies36. In fact, there
is evidence in macaque experiments that subjects shift to per-
forming win-stay lose-switch if this cheap strategy offers a rea-
sonable rate of rewards66. This is consistent with our finding that
mice largely relied on the win-stay lose-switch, since switching
behavior is known to be beneficial for this task (in fact, experi-
mentalists often need to introduce a penalty (often in the form of
a change-over delay) to deter such switching behavior39,67).
Future studies in which the benefits and the costs of various
strategies are manipulated would address this issue.
Finally, one of the main reasons to be interested in serotonin is
the prominent role that drugs affecting this neuromodulator
(such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors: SSRIs) play in
treating psychiatric disorders. Our results suggest that serotonin
boosts plasticity by influencing a form of learning rate. This
resonates, for instance, with the fact that treatment with an SSRI
can be more effective when combined with the so-called cognitive
behavioral therapy (CBT), which encourages re-learning of habits
in patients68. Our result that optogenetic stimulation of 5-HT
neurons primarily impacted the slow RL system is consistent with
this, under the assumption that this system is likely to be involved
in habit formation on a longer timescale33. Thus, our results can
offer
the
prospect
of
richer
and
more
finely
targeted
manipulations.
Methods
The task. Here, we briefly summarize experimental methods that have been
described fully in ref. 17. Eight mice (four SERT-Cre37 and four wild-type litter-
mates) were used for the probabilistic choice task.
At the beginning of each trial, an LED at the center port was illuminated to
signal the mouse to insert its snout into the center port. Once the mouse entered
the center port, the center LED extinguished and LEDs on choice ports located next
to the center port were illuminated. The mouse could then choose one of the choice
ports. Each choice port was associated with a specific reward probability (40 or
10%) and stimulation probability (100 or 0%) for the entire duration of a block of
trials, which lasts 50–150 trials. The center port was illuminated 1.1 s after entering
a choice port, so that the mouse can initiate the next trial.
The reward schedule followed previous experiments38,39, where a reward was
kept associated with a port until the mouse selects the port. Hernstein’s matching
behavior has been shown to approximate choice behaviors in this reward
schedule32,38,39,41.
Reward probabilities can never be the same for the two choice ports in a given
block (if one side is high, the other is low). This is also the case for photo-
stimulation. However, there was a slight bias in the block types: 25% of the blocks
were associated with left high water probability and left photo-stimulation, 37.5%
of the blocks were associated with left high water probability and right photo-
stimulation, 28.1% of the blocks were associated with right high water probability
and left photo-stimulation, and 9.4% of the blocks were associated with right high
water probability and right photo-stimulation. The conclusion of our analysis was
not affected by this bias.
If a water reward was assigned to the side chosen by the mouse, a drop of 3 μl of
water was delivered at the port. If a photo-stimulation was assigned to the chosen
side, a train of 10 ms, 5 mW, pulses was delivered for 1 s at 12.5 Hz.
Data were collected for 15 sessions (1 h and 15 min for each session) from all
mice. Experimenters were blind to the mice genotype throughout the experiment,
until histological analysis was performed afterwards17. All procedures were carried
out in accordance with the European Union Directive 86/609/EEC and approved
by Direcção-Geral de Veterinária of Portugal.
Inter-trial-interval (ITI). We defined the inter-trial-interval (ITI) as the time from
when the mouse left one of the side ports until it entered the center port to initiate
the next trial. Occasionally, animals re-visited the side port long after their first visit
on the same trial (<5% of all trials). These redundant pokes were ignored.
Reward and choice kernel model. Previous studies have shown that animals’
choice behavior in a dynamic foraging task without the change-over-delay con-
straint69 can be well described by a linear two-kernel model (e.g., refs. 17,38). In this
model, the probability PL
t of choosing left on trial t is determined by a linear

forgetting rate of the kernel, η is the initial height of the kernel, and CL = 1 (CR =
1) if Left (Right) is chosen on trial t while 0 otherwise. We note that the initial
height of the choice kernel, η, is normally negative17,38, meaning that the choice
kernel normally captures a tendency toward alternation. Such tendencies are
common in tasks with reward schedules like those in the current task if a penalty
for alternation is not imposed (change-over delay)69.
We assumed that the update takes place on every trial, even those associated
with long ITIs.
Main model. We constructed a model that describes choices on all trials. Since we
found that the characteristics of decision strategies changed according to the ITIs,
we simply assumed a two-agent model, where agent 1 (fast system) makes decisions
on the trials following short ITIs (ITI ≤ TThreshold), while agent 2 (slow system)
makes decisions on the trials following long ITIs (ITI > TThreshold). We allowed the
threshold TThreshold to be a free parameter that is determined by data. We also
tested the fixed value TThreshold = 7 s based on our preliminary analyses and found
results consistent with the variable ITI threshold model (Supplementary Fig. 17).
The fast system generates decisions based on the two-kernel model described in
“Reward and choice kernel model” section. The slow system performs simple Q-
learning. Specifically, the probability PL
t of choosing Left on trial t after a long ITI >
TThreshold is given by

where vL
t (vR
t ) is the value for Left (Right), κ is the bias term, and T is the decision
noise.
The agent updates values for chosen action according to the Rescorla–Wagner
rule, but at different learning rates for photo-stimulation (αStim) and no stimulation
(αNo-Stim) trials. For example, if Left was chosen and photo-stimulation was
applied, the value of Left choice is updated as:

By comparison with Eq. (4), we can see this as a non-forgetful Q-learner, but with a
slightly more convenient parameterization for the reward sensitivity. For a model
comparison purpose, we also fitted a forgetful Q-learner model with
optogenetically modulated learning rates, in which the updates given by Eqs. (9)
and (10) take place for the values of both choices every trial.
Both systems update values for every trial regardless of the preceding ITIs, but
the decision was made by one of them depending on the most recent ITI, where the
threshold TThreshold was also a free parameter. Figure 3 shows the results of this full
model.
Other models. In order to explore other possibilities for optogenetic stimulation
effects, we constructed three other models.
Asymmetric learning rate model: We allowed the model to have different
learning rates for reward and no-reward trials when photo-stimulation was applied.
Specifically, we modified Eq. (9) of the main model as:

if rL = 0. The same is applied for the Right choice.
Multiplicative value model: Here we assumed that photo-stimulation changed
the sensitivity of reward. Specifically, we modified the learning rules of slow system
as:
vL
tþ1 ¼ vL

if photo-stimulation is applied, otherwise

Additive value model: Here we assumed that photo-stimulation carried a
independent rewarding value. Specifically, we modified the learning rules of slow
system as:
vL
tþ1 ¼ vL
t þ α GStim þ rL � vL

if photo-stimulation is applied, otherwise

The same is applied for the Right choice.
Model fitting. In order to determine the distribution of model parameters h, we
conducted a hierarchical Bayesian, random effects analysis48,49,71 for each subject.
In this, the (suitably transformed) parameters hi of experimental session i are
treated as a random sample from a Gaussian distribution with means and variance
