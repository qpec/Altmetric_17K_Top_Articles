ABSTRACT
Background: Therapeutic radiotherapy is an important treatment of
pelvic cancers. Historically, low-fiber diets have been recommended
despite a lack of evidence and potentially beneficial mechanisms of
fiber.
Objective: This randomized controlled trial compared low-, habit-
ual-, and high-fiber diets for the prevention of gastrointestinal tox-
icity in patients undergoing pelvic radiotherapy.
Design: Patients were randomly assigned to low-fiber [#10 g
nonstarch polysaccharide (NSP)/d], habitual-fiber (control), or
high-fiber ($18 g NSP/d) diets and received individualized
counseling at the start of radiotherapy to achieve these targets.
The primary endpoint was the difference between groups in the
change in the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire–
Bowel Subset (IBDQ-B) score between the starting and nadir
(worst) score during treatment. Other measures included mac-
ronutrient intake, stool diaries, and fecal short-chain fatty acid
concentrations.
Results: Patients were randomly assigned to low-fiber (n = 55),
habitual-fiber (n = 55), or high-fiber (n = 56) dietary advice. Fiber
intakes were significantly different between groups (P , 0.001).
The difference between groups in the change in IBDQ-B scores
between the start and nadir was not significant (P = 0.093). How-
ever, the change in score between the start and end of radiother-
apy was smaller in the high-fiber group (mean 6 SD: 23.7 6
12.8) than in the habitual-fiber group (210.8 6 13.5; P = 0.011).
At 1-y postradiotherapy (n = 126) the difference in IBDQ-B
scores between the high-fiber (+0.1 6 14.5) and the habitual-
fiber (28.4 6 13.3) groups was significant (P = 0.004). No sig-
nificant differences were observed in stool frequency or form or
in short-chain fatty acid concentrations. Significant reductions in
energy, protein, and fat intake occurred in the low- and habitual-
fiber groups only.
Conclusions: Dietary advice to follow a high-fiber diet during
pelvic radiotherapy resulted in reduced gastrointestinal toxicity
both acutely and at 1 y compared with habitual-fiber intake.
Restrictive, non–evidence-based advice to reduce fiber intake
in this setting should be abandoned. This trial was registered
at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT 01170299.

INTRODUCTION
Radiation therapy is used in $50% of cancer patients and
plays a critical role in 25% of cancer cures. It is estimated that in
the United States, w300,000 patients/y receive radiotherapy for
pelvic or abdominal malignancies (1, 2). In the United King-
dom, an estimated 17,000 patients/y receive radical (curative)
radiotherapy (3). Despite major advances in radiotherapy tech-
niques, radiation-induced gastrointestinal toxicity is common.
Acutely (during treatment), 90% of patients experience changes
in bowel habit (4). Delayed intestinal radiation toxicity is a
progressive condition with few therapeutic options and sub-
stantial long-term morbidity and mortality (5). Currently there
are an estimated 1.6 million Americans living with postradiation
intestinal dysfunction (1). Modern innovation in radiation tech-
nique may reduce the severity of acute and chronic toxicity, but
it is unlikely ever to abolish it completely.
Therapeutic strategies for the prevention of radiation-induced
gastrointestinal toxicity are limited. The free radical scavenger,
amifostine, is the only FDA-approved agent, but concerns remain
regarding its side effects and its potentially tumor-protective
properties (1). Dietary strategies have been trialed primarily as

 prophylactic agents but with limited success (6), although lack of
evidence may be partly explained by the poor quality of many
studies and the acknowledged difficulties of undertaking robust,
placebo-controlled dietary interventions (7). Clinical benefit
for the manipulation of dietary fiber is inconclusive. Four
randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been conducted
recruiting 264 patients in total (8–11). Three used fiber sup-
plements in combination with low-fat or low-lactose diets (8,
9, 11), whereas another used a low-fiber diet in combination
with a low-lactose diet (10), thus limiting the conclusions that
could be drawn.
Anecdotal evidence suggests that many patients are advised to
reduce fiber intake during pelvic radiotherapy. However, high-
fiber intake may be beneficial via multiple mechanisms. Fer-
mentable (soluble) fiber provides a substrate for the production of
short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) with beneficial effects on gut
health (12), such as promotion of sodium and associated water
uptake and anti-inflammatory activity (13). The gastrointestinal
mucosal response to radiation is proinflammatory (14) with
pathological parallels to inflammatory bowel disease (15), where
high-fiber interventions have been shown to be effective (16).
This RCT was designed to test the hypothesis that a high-fiber
diet would prevent or reduce acute and chronic radiation-induced
gastrointestinal toxicity in patients undergoing radiotherapy for
pelvic cancers. Its secondary objectives were to examine clinical
outcomes of importance to patients including quality of life,
impact on stool frequency and form (consistency), and nutritional
intake.
METHODS
This 2-center, 3-arm (low fiber, habitual fiber, high fiber),
RCT (clinicaltrials.gov ID: NCT 01170299) was conducted in
compliance with Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials
recommendations (17). It was approved by the institutional com-
mittees for clinical research, and ethical consent was granted by
the local Research Ethics Committee.
Patients and radiotherapy protocols
Patients were recruited from the Royal Marsden NHS Foun-
dation Trust, Sutton, Surrey and London and from the Royal
Surrey County Hospital, Guildford, Surrey. Eligible patients were
those with histologically proven gynecologic or lower gastro-
intestinal cancer, due to receive radical (curative) radiotherapy to
the pelvis, with or without concomitant chemotherapy, and able
to tolerate 100% oral diet. Those with established wheat in-
tolerance or celiac disease, a gastrointestinal stent, or a gastro-
intestinal stoma or enrolled in other trials with conflicting toxicity
endpoints were excluded.
Radiotherapy treatment (all pelvic sites) was delivered by
using external beam or intensity-modulated radiotherapy tech-
niques (Supplemental Table 1). All patients received $45 Gray
to the pelvis in 1.8-Gray daily fractions, 5 times/wk, over 5–7 wk.
Patients with gynecologic cancers received high- or low-dose
adjuvant brachytherapy where indicated. Concomitant chemo-
therapy comprised oral daily capecitabine and mitomycin C in
combination with oral capcitabine and weekly intravenous cis-
platin for colorectal, anal, and cervical cancers respectively.
Trial design
Informed, signed consent was obtained before any study-
related procedures. After collection of baseline data, patients
were allocated to a study group with the use of the minimization
method by the Institute of Cancer Research Randomization Unit
and stratified by pelvic site and receipt of concomitant chemo-
therapy. The 3 study groups comprised 1) a low-fiber diet [target
of #10 g nonstarch polysaccharide (NSP)/d], 2) a habitual or ad
libitum diet (control group), and 3) a high-fiber diet (target of
$18 g NSP/d). Patients and investigators were unblinded to
intervention.
Patients in all study groups received an enrollment (start of
treatment) and exit (end of treatment) interview with the study
dietitian and a minimum of 2 on-treatment interviews, each of
20–30 min duration during their radiotherapy. Interviews were
designed to allow for collection of study outcome measurements
and to review compliance with treatment allocation (i.e., fiber
targets). At the enrollment interview, patients allocated to the
high- or low-fiber groups were given a daily fiber target and
counseled on how to achieve this target. The intervention was
based entirely on dietary manipulation with fiber supplements
neither provided nor recommended. Counseling to achieve the
required dietary fiber targets comprised an individualized dis-
cussion regarding usual food choices with emphasis on fiber-rich
foods and an agreement as to how to adjust these choices to
achieve the prescribed target. In addition, patients were given
educational and recording items, including a “Fiber in Foods”
booklet specifically designed for the trial detailing the fiber
content in “points” (or exchanges) of .400 foods commonly
consumed in the United Kingdom and an Exchange Diary in
which to track their fiber intake to improve understanding,
motivation, and compliance. In contrast, patients in the habitual-
fiber (control) group were counseled at their enrollment in-
terview to maintain their normal diet throughout radiotherapy
treatment and not to adjust their fiber intake. However, they
still had the same number of study visits and access to the
research team, although educational or recording materials
were not provided to this group. Patients in all groups had
access to the research dietitian throughout the study to answer
ad hoc study-related dietary or nutritional queries. The dura-
tion of each face-to-face interview during the study was re-
corded, and the median contact time per interview compared
between study groups.
Outcome measurements
Gastrointestinal toxicity was assessed as severity of bowel
symptoms experienced during the acute (baseline to 5–7 wk)
and chronic (1 y after completion of radiotherapy) period.
Symptoms were assessed by using the Inflammatory Bowel
Disease Questionnaire–Bowel Subset (IBDQ-B), which has
been validated in the radiotherapy setting (4). The 32-question
Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) is a quality-
of-life instrument originally developed for patients with in-
flammatory bowel disease (18). A maximum score of 224 and
minimum of 32 can be obtained, with lower scores indicating
most severe symptoms. The 10-question (embedded) IBDQ-B
has a maximum score of 70 and minimum of 10; once again
lower scores indicative of more severe symptoms.

 The IBDQ and IBDQ-B scores were obtained at baseline,
immediately before commencing radiotherapy, and thereafter
weekly during the 5–7 wk of radiotherapy and 1 y after delivery
of the last radiotherapy session. The data were analyzed as ab-
solute values for the nadir (worst) score, end of radiotherapy
(acute), and 1 y after the final radiotherapy (chronic), as well as
the change in values from baseline to each of these time points.
Total acute bowel symptom burden, as a predictor of chronic
burden (19), was examined by computing the IBDQ-B AUC in
patients with $4 consecutive acute scores. The primary outcome
was the difference between study groups in the change in IBDQ-B
between the baseline score and the nadir during radiotherapy.
Other gastrointestinal outcomes included stool form (consis-
tency) and frequency (output). Patients were instructed in the
completion of daily self-reported stool diaries, which included
the Bristol Stool Form Scale (20) for the assessment of stool
form, starting on the day after their enrollment interview through
to their exit interview, covering their entire radiotherapy treat-
ment period. Mean weekly stool frequency, stool form, the
number of days on which stools of type 6/7 were passed, and the
number of days on which antidiarrheal medication was used were
compared between groups during week 1, week 4, and the final
week of radiotherapy.
Stool SCFA concentrations were measured, to investigate the
effect of fiber intake on these and to explore whether they may be
protective mechanisms in preventing radiation-induced gastro-
intestinal toxicity. Stool samples were collected from patients on
day 1 and the final day of radiotherapy and immediately weighed
and stored at 2808C for future analysis of SCFA by using gas-
liquid chromatography. Briefly, SCFAs were extracted in a 1:4
dilution of extraction buffer (1% dihydrogen phosphate, 0.1%
mercuric chloride) containing an internal standard (2,2-dime-
thylbutyric acid) and homogenized (Seward Stomacher 80). The
extraction was centrifuged (Beckman GS6R) at 5000 3 g for
20 min and the supernatant passed through a 0.2-mm filter. In
duplicate, filtered supernatant was injected splitless into a gas-
liquid chromatography system and analyzed by using a chro-
matogram database (Aligent Technologies) to give concentrations
of acetic, propionic, butyric, valeric, isobutyric, and isovaleric
acids in micromoles per gram wet stool.
All patients completed a 7-d food diary during their first and
last weeks of radiotherapy, prospectively recording all food and
fluid consumption. Data were entered into a food composition
database (Dietplan v.6; Forestfield Software Ltd.). Fiber intake
was recorded as NSP intake per day, and absolute and change
values were calculated and compared. Compliance with the fiber
target was defined as achieving 80% of the target for that group,
equating to ,12.0 g NSP/d for the low-fiber group (target
#10 g/d), a change of ,20% in NSP intake between the first
and final week for the habitual-fiber group, and .14.4 g NSP/d
for the high-fiber group (target $18 g/d). Body weight and
BMI (in kg/m2) were obtained at baseline and end the of ra-
diotherapy, and absolute and change values were compared
between groups.
Palatability of the intervention diets was assessed at the end of
radiotherapy by using a 150-mm visual analog scale with re-
sponses ranging from 0 mm (“much worse than my normal diet”)
to 75 mm (“no different to my normal diet”) and 150 mm
(“much better than my normal diet”). The impact of following
the intervention diets on the cost of weekly food bills and time
spent shopping and in food preparation was assessed by the
study research dietitian at the exit interview and is reported
descriptively. Participants were also asked at each study visit to
recall any costs they had incurred that were directly related to
symptom management (e.g., purchase of incontinence pads).
Statistical methods
Statistical analysis was performed by using SPSS software
(v.21) using the ANOVA method for normally distributed data
(e.g., IBDQ-B and total IBDQ scores) or the Kruskal Wallis test
for nonnormally distributed data (e.g., stool frequency) between
the 3 groups. Where significant, intergroup comparisons were
compared by using a Bonferroni post hoc correction. The primary
endpoint was defined as the change in IBDQ-B score between the
start of radiotherapy and the nadir during the radiotherapy period
(acute). This was analyzed by intention-to-treat (ITT) and per
protocol methods. For ITTanalysis, missing baseline scores were
imputed by carrying backward the first available score, and
missing scores at the end of radiotherapy or 1 y were imputed by
using last value carried forward. Missing scores during treatment
were imputed by taking an average of scores on either side of
those missing. Data from patients who withdrew from the trial
before commencing the intervention were excluded from the
analysis. Data from patients who withdrew during the in-
tervention but consented to allow their data to be included were
included in the ITTanalysis. Per-protocol analysis was performed
by using scores from patients who achieved $80% compliance
with fiber target, assessed from the 7-d food diary for the last
week of treatment. Results of these analyses were considered
significant if P , 0.05 (ANOVA), in which case post hoc
analysis was undertaken.
The sample size calculation was based on a previous nutrition
intervention study with a similar design using the IBDQ-B score
as the primary endpoint (21). It was calculated that 156 patients
were required (52 patients/group) to detect a difference in a
change of $6 points in the IBDQ-B score between groups from
the start of radiotherapy to the nadir during treatment, with a
significance level of 0.02 (allowing for multiple comparisons)
and power of 90%. Values are expressed as means 6 SDs.
RESULTS
Patients
Recruitment took place between December 2009 and De-
cember 2013 and was closed when accrual reached n = 166, with
10 additional patients recruited to allow for withdrawals. The
final trial measurement (1-y follow-up) was obtained in January
2015. Figure 1 outlines study accrual. Of the 583 eligible pa-
tients, 417 declined, representing a recruitment rate of 28%. The
major reason for declining study enrollment was reluctance to
adopt a possible change in diet (36% of patients).
Seven patients withdrew: 2 declined to commence the study
immediately after random assignment (low-fiber group), 2 had a
stoma placed before radiotherapy (habitual fiber: 1, high fiber: 1);
2 were hospitalized during treatment and requested withdrawal
(habitual fiber: 1, low fiber: 1), and 1 had a change in treatment
plan and did not receive radiotherapy (high fiber). A total of 161
patients comprised the ITT population as follows: 159 completed

 the intervention, and 2 withdrew partly through the study but
consented to their data being included. Four adverse events
occurred, all of which were hospital admission for symptom
control. None of these was considered related in any way to the
study intervention. There were no significant differences in
baseline characteristics between groups (Table 1).
A total of 644 face-to-face interviews with patients were
conducted by the study dietitian. The median contact time per
interview was not significantly different between groups
(P = 0.161) and amounted to 16 min for the habitual-fiber
group (minimum: 11 min, maximum: 36 min), 18 min (mini-
mum: 9 min, maximum: 31 min) for the low-fiber group, and
18 min (minimum: 10 min, maximum: 34 min) for the high-
fiber group.
IBDQ-B
IBDQ-B scores were obtained weekly for all patients. The
number of missing scores, requiring imputation, for weeks 1–6
and 1 y postradiotherapy was 1, 5, 7, 10, 17, 9, and 35, respectively.
Raw scores and comparisons between groups at all time points are
shown in Table 2. There were no differences in IBDQ-B scores at
baseline between the 3 groups. Overall, IBDQ-B scores decreased
in all groups during treatment, indicative of worsening bowel
symptoms. In the ITT population, there was no significant differ-
ence between groups in the change between the baseline score
(start of radiotherapy) and the nadir during treatment (primary
endpoint, P = 0.093).
There were no differences in absolute IBDQ-B scores at the
end of radiotherapy between the 3 groups; however, there was a
significant difference in the between-group change in scores
between baseline and final week of radiotherapy (P = 0.014)
(Table 2). Post hoc analysis revealed a smaller reduction in score
in the high-fiber group (23.7 6 12.8) compared with the
habitual-fiber group (210.8 6 13.5), a clinically significant
difference of 27.1 points (95% CI: 212.99, 21.27; P = 0.011).
However, the change in score was not significantly different
between the low-fiber group (27.9 6 11.3) and the habitual-
fiber group (P = 0.711) or between the low-fiber and high-fiber
groups (P = 0.251).

 The absolute IBDQ-B scores at 1 y postradiotherapy and the
change in scores between baseline and 1 y postradiotherapy were
significantly different between groups (Table 2). Post hoc
analysis revealed that at 1 y after radiotherapy, IBDQ-B scores
had returned to baseline values in the high-fiber group (+0.1 6
14.5) compared with a reduction in the habitual-fiber group
(28.4 6 13.3), a clinically significant difference of 28.5 points
(95% CI: 214.8, 22.2; P = 0.004). However, the change
in IBDQ-B scores was not significantly different between the
low-fiber group (24.9, SD 12.7) and the habitual-fiber group
(P = 0.546) or between the low-fiber and high-fiber groups
(P = 0.172) (Table 2).
Per protocol analysis revealed no significance differences
between groups in IBDQ-B scores at any time points or in the

 change in scores between time points. However, patient numbers
were small, with only 128 patients (n = 34 for low fiber, n = 22
for habitual fiber, and n = 27 for high fiber) included in the
analysis because of limited numbers achieving $80% compli-
ance with the fiber target.
Computation of IBDQ-B AUC (153 patients) showed no
significant difference between groups (P = 0.576; Kruskal Wallis
test, nonparametric data).

IBDQ scores were obtained weekly for all patients with
missing scores imputed as reported above for IBDQ-B. Raw
scores and comparisons between groups at all time points are
shown in Table 2. There were no differences in IBDQ scores at
baseline between the 3 groups. Overall, scores decreased in all
groups during treatment, indicative of worsening overall symp-
toms and resulting impaired quality of life. In the ITT population,
there was no significant difference between groups in the change
in score between baseline (start of radiotherapy) and the nadir
during treatment (P = 0.203).
There was no difference in absolute IBDQ scores at the end of
radiotherapy between the 3 groups; however, there was a sig-
nificant difference in the change in score between baseline and
the final week of radiotherapy (P = 0.018). Post hoc analysis
revealed a smaller reduction in score in the high-fiber group
(28.2 6 30.2) compared with the habitual-fiber group (224.5 6
32.0), a clinically significant difference of 216.2 points
(95% CI: 230.12, 22.46) (P = 0.015). However, the change in
score was not significantly different between the low-fiber and
habitual-fiber groups (P = 0.708) nor between the low-fiber and
high-fiber groups (P = 0.303).
The absolute IBDQ scores at 1 y postradiotherapy (P = 0.001)
and the change in scores between baseline and 1 y after radio-
therapy were significantly different between groups (P , 0.001).
Post hoc analysis revealed that at 1 y after radiotherapy, IBDQ
scores had returned to exceed baseline values marginally in the
high-fiber group (+2.1 6 29.4) compared with a reduction in the
habitual-fiber group (221.4 6 33.0), a difference of 223.8
points (95% CI: 238.2, 29.3) (P , 0.001). The change in
IBDQ scores was also significantly different between the low-
(213.23 6 30.3) and high-fiber groups (P = 0.030) but not
between the low-fiber and habitual-fiber groups (P = 0.530)
(Table 2).
Per protocol analysis (n = 34 for low fiber, n = 22 for habitual
fiber, n = 27 for high fiber) revealed a significant difference
between groups in IBDQ scores at 1 y after radiotherapy
(P = 0.030). Post hoc analysis revealed a significant difference
of 20.4 points (95% CI: 1.9, 38.9) (P = 0.026) between the high-
fiber and habitual-fiber groups. However, there were no differ-
ences between groups in the change in IBDQ score between any
time points.
Stool frequency and form
Stool diaries were returned by 125 (78%) patients, (39/53 in the
low-fiber group; 44/54 in the habitual-fiber group; 42/54 in the high-
fiber group). There were no significant differences in stool frequency
or stool form during week 1 (start of radiotherapy) or the final week
(end of radiotherapy) between any of the 3 groups, nor was there a
difference in the number of days during which patients experienced a
stool form of 6 or 7 (loose or watery stools) or the number of days on
which antidiarrheal medication was taken (Table 3).
SCFAs
In an exploratory analysis, paired stool samples were provided
by a subgroup of 41 patients at baseline and at the end of ra-
diotherapy (low-fiber group: 15, habitual-fiber group: 16, and
high-fiber group: 10). No significant differences were found
between groups in total SCFA concentrations either at baseline or
the end of radiotherapy (Supplemental Table 2).
Nutritional data
The number of 7-d food diaries returned was 146 (91%) at
baseline (47 in the low-fiber group, 51 in the habitual-fiber group,
and 48 in the high-fiber group) and 139 (86%) during the final
week of radiotherapy (41 in the low-fiber group, 44 in the
habitual-fiber group, and 43 in the high-fiber group). During week
1 of radiotherapy, after dietary advice, there was a significant
difference in fiber intake between groups (P , 0.001: ANOVA),
which was also apparent during the final week of radiotherapy
(P , 0.001: ANOVA), all in line with group allocations (low

 fiber , habitual fiber , high fiber) (Table 4). There were no
differences between groups in the intake of fat or carbohydrates
during week 1 and the final week of radiotherapy or change be-
tween week 1 and the final week. However, there was a significant
difference in protein intake between groups (P = 0.012) during the
final week of radiotherapy (Table 4). Post hoc analysis revealed a
mean difference of 14.6 g protein/d between the low- and high-
fiber groups (68.6 6 24.5 compared with 78.4 6 22.7, P = 0.011).
By using paired data (food diaries returned at both time points)
significant within-group reductions in the low- and habitual-fiber
groups were seen in total energy (low fiber: 2146 kcal/d, habit-
ual fiber: 2171 kcal/d; P = 0.019 and 0.010, respectively), protein
(low fiber: 28.5 g/d, habitual fiber: 27.7 g/d; P = 0.002 and 0.006,
respectively), and fat (low fiber: 27.5 g/d, habitual fiber: 28.3 g/d;
P = 0.014 and 0.016, respectively) intake between week 1 and the
final week of radiotherapy. In contrast, no significant differences in
nutrient intake were observed in the high fiber group.
There were no significant differences in body weight or BMI at
either baseline or the end of radiotherapy (Table 4). Difference in
the change in BMI between groups was significant. Post hoc
analysis revealed this to be between the low- and habitual-fiber
groups (P = 0.058).
Of the 40 of 53 (75%) patients in the low-fiber group and 38 of
54 (70%) in the high-fiber group who completed the palatability
questionnaires, there was no significant difference in perceived
palatability of the low-fiber diet [median: 78.5 mm (minimum:
7 mm, maximum: 146)] compared with the high-fiber diet
[median: 78.0 mm (minimum: 5 mm, maximum: 150 mm)].

DIETARY FIBER IN PELVIC RADIOTHERAPY

 There was little difference between the high- and low-fiber
groups with respect to the impact of the study diet. A total of
64% of patients in the low-fiber group compared with 59% in the
high-fiber group reported that the study diet had a minimal effect
or had reduced the cost of their weekly food bills; 60% of patients
in the low-fiber group compared with 58% in the high-fiber group
reported that the study diet had no impact or reduced time spent
shopping, and 64% of patients in the low-fiber group compared
with 56% in the high-fiber group reported that the study diet had
no effect or had reduced food preparation time. There was no
response from 27% of patients in the low-fiber group and from
34% of patients in the high-fiber group.
Widespread inability among trial participants to recall specific costs
associated with symptom management precluded formal analysis.
DISCUSSION
This is the first RCT designed to test the efficacy of manip-
ulating dietary fiber in patients receiving radical pelvic radio-
therapy. Although no significant difference between groups was
found in the primary outcome (change in IBDQ-B between the
baseline and the nadir), the results revealed a clinically significant
difference in the change in score of 7.1 points (P = 0.011) be-
tween the high-fiber and habitual-fiber groups, between the start
and the end of radiotherapy, pointing to a clear benefit of in-
creased fiber intake. The fact that at 1 y postradiotherapy the
difference in score between these groups was 8.5 points
(P = 0.004), indicating a longer-term effect, fits with the current
concepts of radiotherapy toxicity that encompass the consequen-
tial effect (22), namely that severe acute toxicity predisposes to
longer-term severe toxicity. These differences between groups in
the change in IBDQ-B score are equivalent to a $10% change,
which has previously been defined as “meaningful clinical im-
provement” (23). It should be noted that despite these results we
did not show a gradient of effect. IBDQ-B scores in the low-fiber
group were higher (less severe symptoms) at both time points
compared with the habitual-fiber group, albeit not statistically
significantly, indicating a possible benefit. The analysis of IBDQ
(quality-of-life) scores revealed a similar pattern, with the high-
fiber group maintaining significantly improved scores compared
with the habitual-fiber group at the end of radiotherapy (P = 0.015)
and at 1 y (P # 0.001).
Conducting robust, large-scale nutritional interventions re-
quiring patients to adhere to targets and estimate intake is labor-
intensive and far from straightforward. We set fiber targets based
on the NSP content of foods to ensure compatibility with Dietary
Reference Values in the United Kingdom at the time (24) and
provided a study-specific booklet for patients to readily track their
intake. Patients were coached to use this booklet rather than food
labels as their prime reference source and were given diaries in
which to record daily self-estimated fiber consumption. In the
United Kingdom, food labeling is based on the US Association of
Official Analytic Chemists method of analysis, which yields values
1.6 3 NSP/100 g food. Despite these potential pitfalls, we are
confident in the validity of our findings because a clear differential
in fiber intake was maintained between groups during the first and
final week of treatment (P , 0.001 both time points). Most pa-
tients (85%) reported they found the booklets very easy to use and
would recommend them to others wishing to track their fiber
intake. We conclude from these results that patients in this setting
can meet targets for fiber intake for the duration of their treatment
period by using dietary manipulation alone. Although, we ac-
knowledge that the achievement of compliance is a potentially
complex process, for researchers and patients alike.
Importantly, our findings challenge non–evidence-based ad-
vice to restrict dietary fiber during radical pelvic radiotherapy.
Analysis of stool frequency and form and the number of days on
which loose or watery stools were experienced showed no sig-
nificant differences between groups in any of these character-
istics. Thus, the premise that increased fiber exacerbates a
tendency toward treatment-induced diarrhea appears to lack
physiologic foundation. On the contrary, optimal production of
SCFA by bowel microbiota provided with ample fiber substrate
would encourage sodium and water absorption (12) and thus
help counteract the risk of loose or watery stool. In addition to
promoting water absorption, we hypothesized that increased fiber
intake would enhance SCFA production, which in turn would re-
duce inflammatory processes, thereby mitigating symptoms as re-
flected in the IBDQ-B scores. However, we found no difference
between groups. This may be because of the small number of
samples we obtained, the wide interindividual variations in stool
SCFA concentrations that exist (25), and altered gut transit
time during treatment (26, 27), which has a large effect on
stool SCFA concentrations. Further studies are needed to ex-
plore our hypothesis.
Our interventions had no adverse effect on body weight or total
energy intake. The difference between the low- and habitual-fiber
groups in the change in BMI was of only borderline significance.
Although all of these variables decreased in all groups between
baseline and the end of radiotherapy, no significant differences
between groups occurred. Within-group analysis revealed no
significant change in total energy or macronutrient intake in the
high-fiber group, a finding in keeping with recent research, which
challenges the long-held view that fiber leads to increased satiety
and causes reduced energy intake (28, 29). However, significant
within-group reductions in protein, fat, and total energy intake
occurred in the habitual- and low-fiber groups between baseline
and the end of radiotherapy. We cannot determine whether
maintenance of total energy intake in the high-fiber group
contributed to their improved quality-of-life (IBDQ) scores or
vice versa, although others have reported an association (30, 31).
We recognize that there are a number of factors that could have
confounded our results. First, there was considerable attrition at
1 y, requiring imputation for ITTanalysis. However, the habitual-
fiber group who reported the worst bowel symptoms in the acute
setting also went on to experience the worst symptoms at 1 y
postradiotherapy, which fits with previous research (5, 22).
Second, treatment-related factors were balanced between groups
at baseline. However, patient-related factors, such as smoking
history, inflammatory conditions, and previous surgery, all of
which confer an adverse effect and in contrast, the use of anti-
hypertensive medication and/or 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-
coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, which confer a protective
effect (32) and could have influenced outcomes, were not
captured. Third, cytotoxic agents (antimetabolite capecitabine
and alkylating agents mitomycin C and cisplatin) and/or non–
cancer-related medications, may cause gastrointestinal symptoms
in their own right through inflammatory or other mechanisms and
thus may exacerbate symptoms and overwhelm potentially pro-
tective nutritional agents.

 We conclude that individualized dietetic advice to follow a high-
fiber diet during pelvic radiotherapy was tolerable and resulted in
reduced gastrointestinal toxicity both acutely at the end of radio-
therapy and at 1 y after radiotherapy compared with habitual-fiber
intake. Because we used a physiologic (dietary) intervention, we are
not able to determine whether any specific component or type of
fiber confers most benefit (e.g., readily versus poorly fermentable)
because all foods contain a diverse range of fiber substrates. We
note that a low-fiber diet also appeared to confer some benefit
and may offer a degree of advantage via different mechanisms.
However, we agree with others in that a critical objective for dietetic
practice is that ineffective, unnecessary, or restrictive practices that
lack an evidence base and yet place undue burden on patients are
abandoned (31), and thus our recommendation is that advice to
reduce fiber intake during pelvic radiotherapy be discarded.
