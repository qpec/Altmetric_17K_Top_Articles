Objective: To evaluate changes in maternal mortality rates in Uruguay over the past 25 years, as well as their
distribution by cause, and their temporal relationship with social changes and Human Development Index
(HDI) indicators. Methods: Data on maternal mortality obtained directly from the Uruguayan Ministry of Public
Health for the 2001 to 2015 period were analyzed together with data from the United Nations Inter-Agency
Group for Child Mortality Estimation for the 1990 to 2015 period. The swiftness of the decrease in maternal
mortality per five-year period, the variation in the percentage of abortion-related deaths, and the correlation
with HDI indicators were evaluated. Results: Maternal mortality decreased significantly, basically due to a reduc-
tion in the number of deaths from unsafe abortion, which was the principal cause of maternal mortality in the
1990s. The reduction in maternal mortality over the past 10 years also coincides with a reduction in poverty
and an improvement in the HDI. Conclusion: A rapid reduction occurred in maternal mortality in Uruguay, partic-
ularly in maternal mortality resulting from unsafe abortion. This coincided with the application of a model for
reducing the risk and harm of unsafe abortions, which finally led to the decriminalization of abortion.

1. Introduction
Maternal mortality remains unacceptably high. Every day, around
830 women die worldwide from complications related to pregnancy
or childbirth [1]. It is estimated that around 10.7 million women died
from maternal causes worldwide between 1990 and 2015. Neverthe-
less, significant progress in reducing maternal mortality globally was
also made over this time period. The overall maternal mortality ratio
fell by 44% (95% CI, 33%–48%) from 385 per 100 000 live births in
1990 to 216 per 100 000 live births in 2015. The overall risk of death
from maternal causes fell from 1 in every 73 births in 1990 to 1 in 180
births in 2015 [2].
According to the 2014 United Nations Human Development Report,
despite the advances achieved in all regions of the world, the maternal
mortality ratio in low- and middle-income regions in 2013 was
14 times higher than that of high-income regions of the world, i.e. 230
versus 16 maternal deaths per 100 000 live births, respectively, during
the same time period [2].
Globally, only nine countries have reported achieving Millennium
Development Goal (MDG) 5, none of which is from the Latin American
and Caribbean region, which registered the smallest comparative
decrease in maternal mortality of all the regions in the world between
1990 and 2015 [2].
A dramatic reduction in maternal mortality has occurred in Uruguay
over the past 25 years according to data from the Pan American Health
Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) [3]. Uruguay
now has the second lowest maternal mortality rate in the Americas.
The five countries with the lowest maternal mortality rates in the
region are Canada (11 per 100 000 live-born infants), Uruguay (14 per
100 000), Puerto Rico (20 per 100 000), Chile (22 per 100 000), and
the USA (28 per 100 000) [4].
According to the 2015 WHO estimates, maternal mortality in
Uruguay fell by 59.5% over the past 25 years, with a mean annual
decrease of 3.7% (95% CI, 2.4–5.1). This is greater than the decrease of
50% registered for Latin America and the Caribbean, where the mean
annual decrease was 2.8%. It should be emphasized that there are
countries in the region, such as Peru for example, that have also failed
to achieve MDG 5, despite a decrease in maternal mortality of 73%
according to the United Nations estimates [2].

 In the 1990s, the profile of maternal mortality in Uruguay indicated
unsafe abortion as the principal cause of mortality, followed by
hemorrhage and other complications [5]. Maternal mortality was signif-
icantly greater in the public healthcare sector compared with the
private sector [6].
From the 1990s onward and particularly after the turn of the centu-
ry, a marked reduction in maternal mortality occurred in Uruguay. The
objective of the present paper was to analyze the changes that took
place in Uruguay between 1990 and 2015 regarding maternal mortality,
particularly mortality resulting from unsafe abortion. An evaluation was
also made of the association between these changes and the social and
health-related changes that occurred in the country, as well as the
changes in the human development indicators.
2. Materials and methods
An analysis was conducted of the changes that occurred in maternal
mortality ratios between 2001 and 2015, using data obtained directly
from the Department of Vital Statistics of the Uruguayan Ministry of
Public Health [7]. Analysis of the period between 1990 and 2015 was
conducted using data obtained from WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA, the World
Bank, and the United Nations Population Division [2]. An analysis was
also conducted of the temporal association between the changes in
maternal mortality and the implementation of health and social policies
as well as the different indicators used to calculate the Human Develop-
ment Index (HDI) [8].
The system for registering maternal deaths in Uruguay changed
during this period. Up to 2004, data on maternal deaths were obtained
exclusively from death certificates. From 2005 onward, a system was
implemented to actively search for deaths of women of reproductive
age. The institutions affiliated with the National Integrated Health
System provide information to the Ministry (vital statistics). These
data include a monthly declaration that no maternal deaths have
occurred, i.e. a report of zero maternal mortality from the institutions
that form part of the health system, both in the public and private
sectors [7].
Between 2005 and 2010, data were obtained from death certificates
and from notification; however, the data were not discriminated.
Between 2010 and 2015, the data were differentiated with respect to
how many of the cases were identified from death certificates and
how many as a result of notification.
Furthermore, as a consequence of the country’s commitment to
reducing maternal mortality, there is recognition of the role of surveil-
lance in maternal mortality, resulting in a more extensive and better in-
vestigation of the death of women of reproductive age through a system
of intentional search, review, and reclassification of maternal deaths at
central level and the creation and strengthening of a Committee to
Reduce Maternal Morbidity and Mortality at national level. As a result
of these efforts, the current system of registering maternal deaths in
the country is reliable. In 2013, the clinical histories of 900 women
aged 12 to 49 years who died were evaluated, with the same nine
cases reported by the Morbidity and Mortality Committee being
identified, thus confirming the reliability of the system.
Fig. 1 shows the two data sources used by the Ministry of Health
since 2010 to identify cases of maternal death.
As Uruguay is a small country with around 50 000 live births annu-
ally, the maternal mortality rate may fluctuate greatly from year to year,
since one maternal death can cause a considerable modification in the
ratio. For this reason, it is more appropriate to compare five-year
periods and the tables show both annual and five-year data.
Deaths resulting specifically from unsafe abortion are also reported,
as well as their proportion in relation to the total number of maternal
deaths. In addition, the social indicators (life expectancy at birth,
expected years of schooling, mean number of years of schooling, and
gross national income [GNI] per capita) that constitute the elements
used to calculate the HDI were evaluated [8].
3. Results
Based exclusively on the data registered at the Ministry of Public
Health for the past 15 years, analysis showed a steady decline in
maternal mortality over the period evaluated, although with major

 fluctuations from year to year, as expected. There was a decrease of
19.2% (26.6%–21.5%) in maternal mortality between the first and the
second five-year periods of the present century, and a greater decline
of 28.4% (21.5%–15.4%) between the second and the third five-year
segments (Table 1).
The number of maternal deaths from abortion fell dramatically from
25 to 4 deaths between the first and the second five-year period of this
century and then to 3 in the final five-year segment (Table 2).
Abortion was responsible for around 40% of all maternal deaths in
the first five-year segment, but decreased to around 8% in the next
two periods. The lack of any change in this percentage in the final
five-year segment was due to the rate of maternal mortality from
other causes, which increased slightly between the first and second
five-year segments but decreased significantly between the second
and third five-year periods.
Due to the changes in the procedures used by the Uruguayan
Ministry of Public Health to identify maternal deaths, statistics from
the Maternal Mortality Estimation Inter-Agency Group composed of
WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA, the World Bank, and the United Nations Popula-
tion Division were used to evaluate changes over a longer period of
time. According to the data from this source, historical evolution
showed a marked decrease in the maternal mortality rate in Uruguay
between 1985 and 2015 (Fig. 2), a decrease that was steady, with no
significant fluctuations during the period.
This evaluation made over a longer period of time allowed the speed
of the reduction in the maternal mortality rate to be analyzed and
temporally associated with changes in the different social indicators
that constitute the HDI, as shown in Table 3. Throughout the entire
period evaluated in this study, significant improvements occurred in the
social indicators of the population, with a gradual increase in the HDI.
4. Discussion
The maternal mortality rate in Uruguay has decreased significantly
over the past 25 years. Although the country failed to meet the MDG
on this issue, this decline at least assured Uruguay the second lowest
maternal mortality rate in the Americas, just behind Canada. It is evi-
dent, nonetheless, that this reduction was predominantly the result
of the dramatic reduction in mortality due to unsafe abortion, which
was responsible for almost 40% of maternal deaths at the beginning
of this century, falling to 8% in the last 10 years. Furthermore, applying
the same percentage of reduction in all contexts does not allow coun-
tries in which maternal mortality was already low to achieve the
success attained by those in which the ratios were higher. Since
there are no ideal situations of zero maternal deaths, there are no prac-
tical differences between maternal mortality rates that are below 10 per
100 000 live-born infants.
It is difficult not to accept that it was the progressively broader appli-
cation of the model for reducing the risk and harm of unsafe abortions
that clearly succeeded in reducing maternal mortality from unsafe abor-
tion, even within the framework of legal restrictions.
This tendency toward a reduction in maternal mortality resulted in
the decriminalization of abortion, although it is slightly disappointing
that the maternal mortality rate has not yet reached zero, since some
backstreet abortions continue to be performed under unsafe conditions.
This finding obliges us to investigate why this type of abortion still exists
so that measures can be taken to completely eliminate abortion-related
death. Even so, it has to be mentioned that even abortions carried out
under ideal circumstances imply a certain degree of risk and may occa-
sionally result in maternal death.
The rapid decrease in maternal mortality registered from 2005 on-
ward coincides with the implementation of a range of social and health
actions aimed at protecting women. These actions intensified further
after 2010 with the application of specific policies: the creation and
expansion of universal sexual and reproductive health services, applica-
tion of the risk and harm reduction model throughout the entire
country, implementation of public education policies and, finally, the
decriminalization of abortion.
Notably, this rapid reduction in maternal mortality coincides with a
reduction in the official figures concerning poverty and inequality re-
ported by the Uruguayan government [9], thus complying with the
MDG of reducing poverty between 1990 and 2015. This was achieved
through policies developed predominantly over the past 10 years.

 The parallel between the speed of the reduction in maternal mortal-
ity and of the political, economic, and social situation under different
governments suggests a strong correlation between them. Public
policies aimed at increasing social justice, development, and equality
coincide with a faster reduction in maternal mortality. The deceleration
in this speed in the final segment evaluated is explained by the greater
difficulty in reducing maternal mortality as rates approach zero.
This correlation should not be surprising, since other previous
studies have reported a similar association between public policies for
equality and social justice and a reduction in maternal mortality [9].
Those results, added to the findings of the present analysis, tend to
confirm that maternal mortality is directly associated with and is a
very sensitive indicator of the development of populations. This is
clearly expressed in all the social indicators constituting the HDI,
which improved steadily in Uruguay throughout the entire evaluation
period, while maternal mortality decreased.
For this reason, the results shown in this paper strongly suggest that
in order to reduce maternal mortality other actors outside the health
sector need to become involved. In addition, there must be strong
political commitment, and effective measures must be adopted to
improve social and economic conditions and protect women’s sexual
and reproductive rights.
It was also interesting to find that the implementation of a policy to
decriminalize the practice of safe abortion not only reduces avoidable
deaths in women but, furthermore, does not result in any increase
in the number of induced abortions; on the contrary, the number of
voluntary terminations of pregnancy tends to be reduced, as already
described by other authors [10,11].
Nevertheless, some limitations in these results must be recognized.
Although these efforts and public policies were sufficient to drastically
reduce the occurrence of abortion-related maternal deaths, this was
not the case, at least not at the same level, for the other causes of mater-
nal deaths. The present study did not conduct a more detailed stratifica-
tion of all causes; however, it must be assumed that there are still many
direct causes of maternal death other than those related to abortion.
Questions should be raised regarding why all the positive changes in
life conditions, health care, and public policies did not have a similar
positive effect on maternal mortality resulting from causes unrelated
to abortion. We cannot be completely satisfied with having reached
zero maternal deaths from unsafe abortion. Any maternal death, irre-
spective of its cause, should be prevented and an evaluation has to be
made regarding what other interventions are required to improve the
quality of care provided during pregnancy and childbirth to women
in this country. One possible example may lie in implementing the
systematic surveillance of conditions of severe maternal morbidity
and applying rapid interventions through which to manage such cases.
The changes in the system used to register maternal deaths have in-
creased the reliability of the data obtained, reducing under-registration
to almost zero. If the registration system had not been improved, the
reported reduction in maternal mortality may have been even greater,
possibly allowing Uruguay to get closer to achieving the MDG on
maternal mortality [12].
The experience developed by Uruguay represents an important
advance in the Latin America and Caribbean region and an example
that could be followed by other countries with similar conditions as a
means of achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) recently
established by the United Nations in 2015 [13]. One of the SDGs is to
end the preventable deaths of all women, children, and adolescents,
and to create an environment in which these population groups not
only survive but also develop, transforming their environment, their
health, and their well-being. The goal of the Sustainable Development
Agenda is to reduce maternal mortality worldwide to less than 70
per 100 000 live-born infants between 2016 and 2030, assuring global
priority for this issue [13].
This renewed commitment to reduce maternal mortality within the
SDG framework requires the implementation of innovative practices
such as those described in this analysis.
We expect that the publication of these results will encourage
colleagues in other countries with higher maternal mortality rates to
take equally effective initiatives to reduce maternal mortality in their
countries to levels close to those of more advanced nations, as Uruguay
has successfully done. Less affluent women, the group in whom maternal
mortality and severe morbidity (near-miss) ratios are highest, deserve
that effective measures be taken to reduce their suffering.
