Abstract Over 80% of multiple-tested siRNAs and shRNAs targeting CD95 or CD95 ligand
(CD95L) induce a form of cell death characterized by simultaneous activation of multiple cell death
pathways preferentially killing transformed and cancer stem cells. We now show these si/shRNAs
kill cancer cells through canonical RNAi by targeting the 3’UTR of critical survival genes in a unique
form of off-target effect we call DISE (death induced by survival gene elimination). Drosha and
Dicer-deficient cells, devoid of most miRNAs, are hypersensitive to DISE, suggesting cellular
miRNAs protect cells from this form of cell death. By testing 4666 shRNAs derived from the CD95
and CD95L mRNA sequences and an unrelated control gene, Venus, we have identified many toxic
sequences - most of them located in the open reading frame of CD95L. We propose that specific
toxic RNAi-active sequences present in the genome can kill cancer cells.

Introduction
One of the most popular methods utilized to reduce gene expression in cells is RNA interference
(RNAi). RNAi has been used in several studies to identify genes critical for the survival of human can-
cer cell lines (Cowley et al., 2014; Hadji et al., 2014; Hart et al., 2014; Morgens et al., 2016;
Wang et al., 2015). During RNAi, gene expression is inhibited by small interfering (si)RNAs, small
hairpin (sh)RNAs or micro (mi)RNAs. miRNAs are generated as primary transcripts in the nucleus
where they undergo processing to pre-miRNAs by the Drosha-DGCR8 complex before being
exported to the cytosol by exportin 5 (Ha and Kim, 2014; Krol et al., 2010). Once in the cytosol,
pre-miRNAs and shRNAs are cleaved by Dicer, a type III RNase that functions in complex with TRBP,
generating 21–23 nucleotide long fragments of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) that have two nucleo-
tide 3’ overhangs (Zamore et al., 2000). DsRNA fragments or chemically synthesized double-
stranded siRNAs are loaded into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) as single-stranded RNAs
(the guide RNA) (Siomi and Siomi, 2009). A near-perfect complementarity between the guide
strand of the si/miRNA and the target mRNA sequence results in cleavage of the mRNA (Pratt and

 MacRae, 2009). Incomplete complementarity results in inhibition of protein translation and contrib-
utes to mRNA degradation (Guo et al., 2010). mRNA targeting is mostly determined by the seed
sequence, positions 2-7/8 of the guide strand, which is fully complementary to the seed match in the
3’UTR of targeted mRNAs. Similar to miRNAs, although not fully explored, siRNAs and shRNAs also
target multiple mRNAs besides the mRNAs they were designed to silence—a phenomenon com-

effect
(OTE)—that

(Birmingham et al., 2006; Jackson et al., 2006; Lin et al., 2005).
The death receptor CD95 (Fas/APO-1) mediates induction of apoptosis when bound by its cog-
nate ligand CD95L, most prominently in the context of the immune system (Krammer, 2000). How-
ever, more recently, it has become apparent that the CD95/CD95L system has multiple tumor-
promoting activities (Peter et al., 2007). CD95 signaling promotes cell growth (Chen et al., 2010),
increases motility and invasiveness of cancer cells (Barnhart et al., 2004; Kleber et al., 2008), and
promotes cancer stemness (Ceppi et al., 2014; Drachsler et al., 2016; Qadir et al., 2017). In fact,
we reported tumors barely grew in vivo when the CD95 gene was deleted (Chen et al., 2010;
Hadji et al., 2014). Therefore, it appeared consistent that multiple shRNAs and siRNAs targeting
either CD95 or CD95L slowed down cancer cell growth (Chen et al., 2010) and engaged a distinct
form of cell death characterized by the activation of multiple cell death pathways (Hadji et al.,
2014). This unique form of cell death cannot be inhibited by conventional cell death or signaling
pathway inhibitors or by knockdown of any single gene in the human genome (Hadji et al., 2014); it
preferentially affects transformed cells (Hadji et al., 2014) including cancer stem cells (Ceppi et al.,
2014). Here, we report that loading of CD95 and CD95L-derived sequences (si/shRNAs targeting
CD95 or CD95L) into the RISC elicits a distinct form of cell death that results from the targeting of
multiple survival genes in a unique form of OTE.
eLife digest Cells store their genetic code within molecules of DNA. Some of this information
will be copied into chemically similar molecules called RNAs, from which the sequence of letters in
the genetic code can be translated to build proteins. However, these messenger RNAs are not the
only RNA molecules that cells can make. MicroRNAs are other short pieces of RNA that closely
match sequences in parts of certain messenger RNAs. The messenger RNAs targeted by microRNAs
are broken down inside the cell, which reduces how much protein can be produced from them.
Since its discovery, scientists have exploited this process – called RNA interference (or RNAi for
short) – and designed microRNA-like small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to target particular messenger
RNAs and decrease the levels of the corresponding proteins in countless experiments.
Two proteins that have been studied in RNAi experiments are CD95 and its interaction partner
CD95L. Both of these proteins are important in human cancer cells, and targeting them via RNAi
killed cancer cells in an unknown mechanism that the cancer cells were unable to resist.
RNAi experiments are designed to be specific, but sometimes they can accidently target other
non-target messenger RNAs. Putzbach, Gao, Patel et al. have now analyzed all of the siRNAs that
can be made from the messenger RNAs for CD95 and CD95L to mediate RNAi in cancer cells. This
revealed that several messenger RNAs, other than those for CD95 and CD95L, were unintentionally
being targeted, including many that code for proteins that cells need to survive. Further
examination of the messenger RNA for CD95 and CD95L showed that they contain short sequences
that are similar to those in the messenger RNAs of the genes that encode these survival proteins.
Putzbach et al. were able to study and then predict which siRNA sequences would be toxic to
cancer cells.
These findings indicate that an RNAi off-target effect may actually be used to kill cancer cells.
Future studies will determine whether this effect could be exploited to shrink tumors in animal
models of cancer. If successful, this in turn could lead to new treatments for cancer patients.

 Results
si/shRNAs kill cells in the absence of the targeted site
More than 80% of multiple-tested shRNAs or siRNAs designed to target either CD95 or CD95L were
toxic to multiple cancer cells (Hadji et al., 2014). We have now extended this analysis to Dicer sub-
strate 27mer DsiRNAs designed to target CD95L (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, [Kim et al.,
2005]). All five DsiRNAs displayed toxicity when introduced into HeyA8 cells at 5 nM (Figure 1—fig-
ure supplement 1B) reinforcing our previous observation that the majority of CD95 and CD95L tar-
geting si/shRNAs are toxic to cancer cells. We also analyzed a data set of a genome-wide analysis of
216 cells infected with a pooled library of the TRC shRNAs (Cowley et al., 2014). Most of the
shRNAs we have tested were found to be depleted in the infected cell lines included in this study.
The following shRNAs were found to be depleted in the listed percentage of the 216 cell lines
tested: shL4 (99.5%), shL1 (96.8%), shR6 (88.9%), shR7 (75%), shR3 (71.8%), shL2 (67.1%), shR5
(38.4%), shL5 (26.4%), and shR8 (21.3%) (Figure 1—figure supplement 1C). Consistent with our
data, shL1 and shR6 were found to be two of the most toxic shRNAs. Again in this independent anal-
ysis, the majority of tested shRNAs (67%) targeting either CD95 or CD95L killed more than half of all
tested cancer cell lines.
Interestingly, a more recent RNAi screen did not report toxicity after expressing shRNAs against
CD95 or CD95L (Morgens et al., 2016). The authors of this study used a second-generation shRNA
platform based on a miR-30 backbone. To determine the source of the discrepancy in the data, we
generated miR-30-based Tet-inducible versions of some of our most toxic shRNAs (shL1, shL3, shL4,
shR5, shR6, and shR7, Figure 1—figure supplement 2A) and found none of them to be highly toxic
to HeyA8 cells (Figure 1—figure supplement 2B). To determine their knockdown efficiency, we
induced their expression in cells carrying sensor plasmids in which the fluorophore Venus was linked
to either the CD95L or CD95 open reading frame (ORF). Expression of most of these miR-30-based
shRNAs also did not efficiently silence Venus expression (Figure 1—figure supplement 2C). In con-
trast, two of our most toxic shRNAs shL3 and shR6 when expressed in the Tet-inducible pTIP vector
not only killed HeyA8 cells, but also very efficiently suppressed Venus fluorescence in cells express-
ing the targeted Venus sensor (Figure 1—figure supplement 2D). These data suggest that the lev-
els of shRNAs produced from the miR-30-based vector may not be sufficient to be toxic to the
cancer cells. Because expression levels of shRNAs are difficult to titer, we used siRNAs to determine
the concentration of the toxic CD95L-derived siL3 required to kill HeyA8 cells (Figure 1—figure sup-
plement 2E). Growth was effectively blocked (and cells died, data not shown) when siL3 was trans-
fected at 1 nM—a concentration well below the commonly used and recommended siRNA
concentration of 5–50 nM)—but not at 0.1 nM. These data suggest that this form of toxicity does
not require high amounts of si- or shRNAs; however, the low expression we achieved from the miR-
30 based shRNA vectors was not enough to effectively induce the toxicity. Because these miR-30-
based shRNA vectors were developed to reduce off-target effects, the toxicity of CD95 and CD95L-
targeting si/shRNAs described by us and others could be due to an OTE. While this was a plausible
explanation, the high percentage of toxic si/shRNAs derived from CD95 and CD95L seemed to
exclude a standard OTE and pointed at a survival activity of CD95 and CD95L.
We therefore tested whether exogenously added recombinant CD95L protein could protect cells
from the toxicity of CD95L-derived shRNAs. When NB7 cells were incubated with different concen-
trations of a soluble form of CD95L (S2), toxicity exerted by shL1 was not affected (Figure 1A, left
panel). NB7 neuroblastoma cells were chosen for these experiments because they lack expression of
caspase-8 (Teitz et al., 2000) and hence are completely resistant to the apoptosis-inducing effects
of CD95L. An ostensible moderate and dose-dependent protection was detected when cells were
treated with a highly active leucine-zipper tagged CD95L (LzCD95L) (Figure 1A, center panel). How-
ever, this effect is likely due to the growth-promoting activities of soluble CD95L, which also signifi-
cantly affected the growth of the cells expressing a scrambled control shRNA (seen for both S2 and
LzCD95L). The recombinant LzCD95L protein was active, as demonstrated by its apoptosis-inducing
capacity in CD95 apoptosis-sensitive MCF-7 cells (Figure 1A, right panel).
To test whether CD95L or CD95 proteins could protect cancer cells from death, we introduced
silent mutations into the targeted sites of three very toxic shRNAs: shL1, shL3 (both targeting
CD95L) and shR6 (targeting CD95). We first introduced eight silent mutations into the sites targeted
by either shL1 or shL3 (Figure 1B) and expressed these proteins in NB7 cells (Figure 1C). Both

 mutant constructs were highly resistant to knockdown by their cognate shRNA but still sensitive to
knockdown by the other targeting shRNA (Figure 1C). Overexpression of these shRNA-resistant ver-
sions of the CD95L ORF did not protect the cells from shL1 or shL3, respectively (Figure 1D). Inter-
estingly, expression of full length CD95L slowed down the growth of the NB7 cells right after
infection with the lentivirus despite the absence of caspase-8 (data not shown). Infection with
shRNAs was therefore performed 9 days after introducing CD95L when the cells had recovered and
expressed significant CD95L protein levels (Figure 1C). We then mutated the CD95 mRNA in the
targeted site of shR6 (Figure 1E). Neither expression of wild-type (wt) nor mutated (MUT) CD95 in
MCF-7 cells (Figure 1F) reduced the toxicity when cells were infected with the pLKO-shR6 or
another toxic lentiviral shRNA, pLKO-shR7 (Figure 1G). These data suggested that neither exoge-
nously added recombinant CD95L or exogenously expressed CD95L or CD95 protein can protect
cells from toxic shRNAs derived from these genes.
To determine whether we could prevent cancer cells from dying by this form of cell death by
deleting the endogenous targeted sites, we used CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing to excise sites targeted
by different shRNAs and siRNAs in both alleles of the CD95 and CD95L genes. We first deleted a 41
nt piece of the CD95L gene in 293T cells, that contained the target site for shL3 (Figure 2A and C).
While internal primers could not detect CD95L mRNA in three tested clones, primers outside of the
deleted area did detect CD95L mRNA (Figure 2D, and data not shown). Three clones with this shL3
D41 deletion were pooled and tested for toxicity by shL3 expressed from a Tet-inducible plasmid
(pTIP-shL3). Compared to a pool of control cells transfected only with the Cas9 plasmid, the 293T
shL3 D41 cells were equally sensitive to the toxic shRNA (Figure 2G). This was also observed when
the clones were tested individually (data not shown).
To exclude the possibility that shL3 was inducing cell death due to a unique activity of shL3 and/
or 293T cells, we deleted the same 41 nt in CD95L in the ovarian cancer cell line HeyA8; We also
generated HeyA8 clones in which we either removed a 64 nt region containing the target site for the
siRNA siL3 in the CD95L coding sequence or a 227 nt region containing the target site for shR6 in
CD95 (Figure 2A and B and Figure 2—figure supplement 1). In all cases, homozygous deletions
were generated (Figure 2E). To confirm the deletion of the shR6 target site, we infected HeyA8 cells
treated with the Cas9 plasmid only and HeyA8 with a homozygous deletion of the shR6 site with
shR6 and, as positive controls, with shR2 (targeting the CD95 ORF) and shR6’ (targeting the CD95
3’UTR). Five days after infection, CD95 mRNA was quantified by real time PCR using a primer
located outside the 227 bp deletion (Figure 2F). The mutated CD95 mRNA was still detectable in
the shR6 D227 cells. While shR2 and shR6’ (both targeting outside the deleted region) caused knock-
down of CD95 mRNA in both the Cas9 control and the shR6 D227 cells, shR6 could only reduce

 mRNA expression in the Cas9 control cells. These data document that HeyA8 CD95 shR6 D227 cells
no longer harbor the sequence targeted by shR6.
Now having HeyA8 cells lacking one of three RNAi-targeted sites in either CD95 or CD95L, we
could test the role of the CD95 and CD95L gene products in protecting HeyA8 cells from the death
induced by either shRNA (shL3 and shR6, two different vectors: pLKO or the Tet inducible pTIP) or
the siRNA siL3. In all cases, the shRNA or siRNA that targeted the deleted region was still fully toxic
to the target-site deleted cells (Figure 2H and I). We saw efficient growth reduction and cell death
in siL3 site-deleted cells transfected with as little as 1 nM siL3 (Figure 2I, and data not shown). These
data firmly establish that cells were not dying due to the knockdown of either CD95 or CD95L.
Involvement of canonical RNAi
shRNAs and early generation naked siRNAs showed general toxicity when introduced in large
amounts, presumably by eliciting an interferon (IFN) response (Marques and Williams, 2005) or by
saturating the RISC (Grimm et al., 2006). However, both chemically modified siRNAs at very low
concentrations and lentiviral shRNAs at an MOI <1 were still toxic (data not shown). We therefore
decided to test whether the observed toxicity involved canonical RNAi and activity of the RISC. To
test shRNAs or siRNAs targeting CD95L, we introduced the Venus-CD95L sensor (inset in
Figure 3A, right panel) into HeyA8 CD95 protein k.o. cells we had generated in the process of
deleting the shR6 site (Figure 2—figure supplement 1, clone #2 was used for the following studies;
see figure legend for strategy and characterization of the clones). While double-stranded (ds)-siL3
effectively silenced Venus expression and induced toxicity, neither the sense nor the antisense sin-
gle-stranded (ss)RNAs significantly decreased Venus expression or induced toxicity (Figure 3A). In
addition, no activity was found when ds-siL3, synthesized as deoxyribo-oligonucleotides, was trans-
fected into the cells (Figure 3B). Using this type of analysis, we tested a number of modified siRNAs
for RNAi activity and toxicity. For siRNAs to be fully active, they require 3’ overhangs on both
strands (Bernstein et al., 2001). Converting siL3 to a blunt-end duplex resulted in substantial loss of
RNAi activity and toxicity (Figure 3C). Due to the topology of the RISC, siRNA activity is decreased
by modification of the 5’ end of the antisense/guide strand (Chiu and Rana, 2003). To test whether
cell death induced by siL3 would be affected by a bulky modification, we placed a Cy5 moiety at any
of the four possible ends of the siL3 duplex. Only when the siL3 duplex carried a 5’ modification in
the guide strand did it prevent RNAi activity and toxicity; modifications in the three other positions
had no effect (Figure 3C). This was confirmed for another siRNA, siL2. To test whether the toxicity
of siL3 required association with a macromolecular complex, which would be consistent with RISC
involvement, we performed a competition experiment. HeyA8 cells were transfected with 10 nM of

 siL3, and a mutated nontoxic oligonucleotide, siL3MUT, was titered in (Figure 3D). siL3MUT
reduced the growth inhibitory activity of siL3 in a dose-dependent fashion suggesting that siL3 and
siL3MUT compete for the same binding site in the cells, pointing at involvement of the RISC.
To determine involvement of RNAi pathway components in the toxicity of CD95 and CD95L-
derived sequences, we tested HCT116 cells deficient for either Drosha or Dicer (Kim et al., 2016).
Growth of parental HCT116 cells was impaired after infection with shL3 or shR6 viruses (Figure 3E,
left panel). Consistent with the requirement of Dicer to process shRNAs, Dicer-/- cells were
completely resistant to the toxic shRNAs (Figure 3E, center panel). This was also supported by the
inability of shR6 to silence CD95 protein expression in these cells (Figure 3F). Dicer-/- cells were not
resistant to toxic siRNAs as these cells died when transfected with siL3, which is consistent with
mature siRNAs not needing further processing by Dicer (Figure 3G, center panel). Interestingly, Dro-
sha-/- cells were hypersensitive to the two toxic shRNAs (Figure 3E, right panel, p<0.0001, according
to a polynomial fitting model), and shR6 efficiently knocked down CD95 expression in Drosha-/- cells
(Figure 3F). Both Drosha-/- and Dicer-/- cells were much more susceptible to the toxicity induced by
siL3 than parental cells (Figure 3G, center and right panel, p<0.0001, according to a polynomial fit-
ting model). The hypersensitivity of the Drosha-/- cells to toxic si/shRNAs and of Dicer-/- cells to toxic
siRNAs can be explained by Drosha-/- and Dicer-/- cells allowing much more efficient uptake of
mature toxic RNAi-active species into the RISC because they are almost completely devoid of com-
peting endogenous miRNAs (Kim et al., 2016).
To determine the contribution of the siRNA seed sequence to their toxicity, we generated a set
of chimeric siRNAs in which we systematically replaced nucleotides of the toxic siL3 siRNA with
nucleotides of a nontoxic scrambled siRNA. We did this starting either from the seed end or from
the opposite end (Figure 3H). HeyA8 cells expressing both the Venus-CD95L sensor (to monitor
level of knockdown) and a Nuc-Red plasmid to fluorescently label nuclei (to monitor the effects on
cell growth) were transfected with 5 nM of the chimeric siRNAs; total green fluorescence and the
number of red fluorescent nuclei were quantified over time. The siL3 control transfected cells
showed an almost complete suppression of the green fluorescence and high toxicity. In the top
panel of Figure 3H, the data are summarized in which siL3 nucleotides were stepwise replaced with
siScr nucleotides from the seed sequence end. Both RNAi and toxicity were profoundly reduced

 when three of the terminal siL3 nucleotides were replaced with the siScr nucleotides in those posi-
tions, suggesting the seed region (6mer highlighted in blue) is critical for both activities. Consis-
tently, as shown in the bottom panel of Figure 3H, when siL3 nucleotides were replaced with siScr
nucleotides from the non-seed end, neither RNAi nor the toxicity was diminished until replacements
affected residues in the seed region. These data suggest the 6mer seed sequence of siL3 was critical
for both RNAi activity and its toxicity.
Toxic si/shRNAs cause downregulation of survival genes
A general OTE by RNAi has been described (Birmingham et al., 2006; Jackson et al., 2006;
Lin et al., 2005). However, this was been reported to cause toxicity in most cases, and the targeted
mRNAs were difficult to predict (Birmingham et al., 2006). The fact that 22 of the tested CD95 and
CD95L-targeting sh- and si/DsiRNAs were toxic to many cancer cells evoking similar morphological
and biological responses (Hadji et al., 2014) generated a conundrum: Could an OTE trigger a spe-
cific biology? To test this, we expressed two toxic shRNAs - one targeting CD95L (shL3) and one tar-
geting CD95 (shR6) - in cells lacking their respective target sequences and subjected the RNA
isolated from these cells to an RNA-Seq analysis. In order to detect effects that were independent of
cell type, delivery method of the shRNA, or targeted gene, we expressed shL3 in 293T (DshL3) cells
using the Tet-inducible vector pTIP and shR6 in HeyA8 (DshR6) cells using the pLKO vector. In each
case, changes in RNA abundance were compared to cells expressing a non-targeting shRNA in
matching vectors. Total RNA was harvested in all cases at either the 50 hr time point (before the
onset of cell death) or at the 100 hr time point (during cell death) (Figure 4A). To achieve high strin-
gency, the data were then analyzed in two ways: first, using a conventional alignment-based analysis
to identify genes for which the mRNA changed more than 1.5-fold (and an adjusted p-value of less
than 0.05) and second, by a read-based method, in which we first identified all reads that
changed >1.5 fold and then subjected each read to a BLAST search to identify the gene it was
derived
from.
Only
RNAs
that
were
detected
by
both
methods
were
considered
(Supplementary file 1). The combination of the analyses resulted in one mRNA that was upregu-
lated and 11 mRNAs that were downregulated (Figure 4B). Using an arrayed qPCR approach, most
of these detected mRNA changes were validated for both cell lines (Figure 4—figure supplement
1A). Interestingly, for nine of the eleven genes, published data suggest they are either highly upre-
gulated in cancer and/or critical for the survival of cancer cells, as their inhibition or knockdown
resulted in either growth reduction or induction of various forms of cell death (see legend of Fig-
ure 4—figure supplement 1 for details). Significantly, six of these eleven downregulated genes
were recently identified in two independent genome-wide lethality screens to be critical for cancer
cell survival (Blomen et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2015) (Figure 4B and Figure 4—figure supplement
1B) (Supplementary file 2). Considering these two screens only identified 6.6% of human genes to
be critical for cell survival, we found a significant enrichment (54.5%, p-value=3�10�6 according to
binomial distribution) of these survival genes among the genes downregulated during the cell death
induced by either shL3 or shR6. All six survival genes are either highly amplified or mutated in human
cancers (Figure 4—figure supplement 2A). In addition to these six genes, GNB1 and HIST1H1C
were reported to be required fitness genes in a recent high-resolution CRISPR-based screen
(Hart et al., 2015). A kinetic analysis showed most of the deregulated mRNAs were downregulated
early with a significant effect already at 14 hr, more than two days before the onset of cell death
(Figure 4—figure supplement 1C and data not shown). This suggested the cells were dying
because of the silencing of multiple critical survival genes, providing an explanation for why multiple
cell death pathways were activated. We therefore call this type of cell death DISE (for Death Induced
by Survival gene Elimination).
To confirm some of the downregulated genes were also critical survival genes for HeyA8 cells, we
transfected HeyA8 cells with siRNA SmartPools targeting each of the eleven genes. Individual knock-
down of seven of the targeted genes resulted in reduced cell growth when compared to cells trans-
fected with a pool of scrambled siRNAs (Figure 4C). To mimic the effect of the CD95 and CD95L-
derived shRNAs, we treated HeyA8 cells with a combination of siRNA pools targeting these seven
genes. Remarkably, 1 nM of this siRNA mixture (35.7 pM of each individual siRNA) was sufficient to
effectively reduce growth of the cells (Figure 4—figure supplement 2B) and also cause substantial
cell death (Figure 4—figure supplement 2C), suggesting it is possible to kill cancer cells with very
small amounts of siRNAs targeting a network of these survival genes.

 To test the generality of this phenomenon, we inducibly expressed another CD95L derived
shRNA, shL1, in 293T cells using the pTIP vector, and transfected HeyA8 cells with 25 nM siL3. We
subjected the cells to RNA-Seq analysis 100 hrs and 48 hrs after addition of Dox or after transfec-
tion, respectively. To determine whether survival genes were downregulated in all cases of sh/
siRNA-induced cell death, we used a list of 1882 survival genes and 423 genes not required for sur-
vival (nonsurvival genes) recently identified in a CRISPR lethality screen (Supplementary file 2). We
subjected the four ranked RNA-Seq data sets to a gene set enrichment analysis using the two gene
sets (Figure 4D). In all cases, survival genes were significantly enriched towards the top of the
ranked lists (most downregulated). In contrast, nonsurvival genes were not enriched. One interesting
feature of DISE that emerged was the substantial loss of histones. Of the 16 genes that were signifi-
cantly downregulated in cells treated with any of the four sh/siRNAs, 12 were histones (Figure 4E).
While it might be expected that dying cells would downregulate highly expressed genes such as his-
tones, we believe that losing histones is a specific aspect of DISE because a detailed analysis
revealed the downregulated histones were not the most highly expressed genes in these cells (Fig-
ure 4—figure supplement 3). In addition, almost as many genes with similarly high expression were
found to be upregulated in cells after DISE induction.
A Metascape analysis revealed genes involved in mitotic cell cycle, DNA conformation change,
and macromolecular complex assembly were among the most significantly downregulated across all
cells in which DISE was induced by any of the four sh/siRNAs (Figure 4F). These GO clusters are con-
sistent with DISE being a form of mitotic catastrophe with cells unable to survive cell division
(Hadji et al., 2014) and suggest a general degradation of macromolecular complexes.
Toxic si/shRNAs target survival genes in their 3’UTR
To test whether the toxic shRNAs directly targeted genes through canonical RNAi, we subjected the
two gene lists obtained from the RNA-Seq analysis (the cell lines treated with either shL3 or shR6 at
the 50 hr time point) to a Sylamer analysis (van Dongen et al., 2008) designed to find an enrichment
of miRNA/siRNA-targeted sites in the 3’UTR of a list of genes ranked according to fold downregula-
tion (Figure 5A). This analysis identified a strong enrichment of the cognate seed match for shL3
and shR6 in cells treated with either of these two shRNAs. The analyses with cells treated with
shRNAs for 100 hrs looked similar but less significant, suggesting early targeting by the shRNAs fol-
lowed by secondary events (data not shown). Enrichment in 6mers and 8mers were both detected
(only 8mers shown) in the 3’UTRs but not the ORF of the ranked genes (data not shown).
Interestingly, the seed matches detected by the Sylamer analysis were shifted by one nucleotide
from the expected seed match based on the 21mer coded by the lentivirus. RNA-Seq analysis

lethality screens. The number of essential genes was enriched from 6.6% of the tested genes (Blomen et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2015) to 54.5% in our

 performed for the small RNA fraction confirmed in all cases (shScr and shL3 in pTIP, and shScr and
shR6 in pLKO), the shRNAs in the cells were cleaved in a way resulting in the predominant formation
of an siRNA shifted one nucleotide away from the shRNA loop region (black arrow heads in Fig-
ure 5—figure supplement 1A). This allowed us to design toxic mature siRNAs based on the sequen-
ces of shL3 and shR6. These shRNA-to-siRNA converts were toxic to HeyA8 cells (Figure 5—figure
supplement 1B) confirming that the observed toxicity was not limited to the TRC shRNA platform,
but based on a sequence-specific activity of the si/shRNAs.
The generalizability of the Sylamer results for shL3 and shR6 was tested with cells treated with
either shL1 or siL3. In both cases, when the ranked RNA Seq data were subjected to a Sylamer analy-
sis, the seed matches of the si/shRNA introduced were again significantly enriched in the 3’UTR of
downregulated RNAs (Figure 5—figure supplement 2). In none of the Sylamer analyses of the four
data sets, did we see enrichment of seed matches in the 3’UTRs of downregulated RNAs that
matched the passenger strand. In all cases, the only significantly enriched sequences matched the
seed sequences in the guide strand of the si/shRNAs we introduced.
Our data suggested that DISE inducing si/shRNAs caused an early loss of survival genes, and at
the same time downregulated RNAs through canonical RNAi targeting their 3’UTR. However, it was
not clear whether the most highly downregulated survival genes were targeted in their 3’UTR by
RNAi-active sequences. We determined as little as six nucleotides dictated whether an siRNA killed
cancer cells (see Figure 3H). 10 of the 11 downregulated genes identified in the RNA-Seq analysis
described in Figure 4A and B contained multiple 6mer seed matches for either shL3 and/or shR6
(Figure 5B). It is therefore likely the two shRNAs, shL3 and shR6, killed cells by targeting a network
of genes enriched in critical survival genes through RNAi. The only gene without an shL3 or shR6
seed match was HIST1H1C. Interestingly, only four of the histones downregulated in cells after treat-
ment with any of the four tested si/shRNAs had a 3’UTR (underlined in Figure 4E) suggesting that
most histones were not directly targeted by the si/shRNAs.
Using arrayed qPCR, we tested whether other toxic shRNAs targeting either CD95 or CD95L also
caused downregulation of some of the 11 genes silenced by shL3 and shR6. HeyA8 cells were trans-
fected with the toxic siRNA siL3 (RNA harvested at 80 hrs) or the toxic shRNAs shL1, shL3 or shR7
(RNA harvested at 100 hrs). While shL1 did not have much of an effect on the expression of these
genes, shR7 caused downregulation of 7 of 11 of the same genes targeted by shL3 even though the
6mer seed matches of the two shRNAs are very different (CTTTGT for shL3 and GGAGGA for shR7)
(Figure 4—figure supplement 1D).
To determine whether preferential targeting of survival genes was responsible for the death of
the cells, we tested whether there was an association between the presence or absence of a pre-
dicted seed match in the 3’UTR for the si/shRNA introduced and whether a gene would be downre-
gulated (>1.5 fold downregulated, p<0.05) among survival genes using the Fisher’s Exact test
(Figure 5C). In almost all cases, this analysis revealed that survival genes containing a predicted
seed match in their 3’UTR were statistically more likely to be downregulated than survival genes
without such a motif. The analysis with shL1 treated cells did not reach statistical significance, likely
due to the fact that this shRNA was found to be very toxic and the 100 hr time point may have been
too late to observe evidence of significant targeting. This interpretation is supported by the observa-
tion that the significance for both shL3 and shR6 to target survival genes was higher at 50 hrs when
compared to the 100 hr time points (Figure 5C) and that the Sylamer analysis of the shL1 treated
cells was less significant after 100 hrs of treatment than any of the other Sylamer analyses (Figure 5—
figure supplement 2).
Now that we had established that the toxicity of the studied shRNAs involved targeting of survival
genes rather than CD95 or CD95L, we had to assume that when studying a larger set of shRNAs
that the level of knockdown of the targeted genes and the toxicity were not strictly correlated. This
was confirmed for the TRC shRNAs targeting the ORF or 3’UTR of CD95 in CD95 high expressing
HeyA8 cells (Figure 5—figure supplement 3). While some of the toxic shRNAs efficiently silenced
CD95 (i.e. shR6 and shR2) few did not (i.e. shR5). In summary, our analyses suggest that cells die by
DISE due to an early and selective silencing of survival genes through targeting seed matches in their
3’UTR followed by the downregulation of histones.

 Identification of toxic shRNAs in the CD95L and CD95 mRNAs
The majority of commercially available si-, Dsi-, and shRNAs targeting either CD95 or CD95L were
highly toxic to cancer cells. We therefore asked whether these two genes contained additional
sequences with similar activity. To test all shRNAs derived from either CD95L or CD95, we synthe-
sized all possible shRNAs, 21 nucleotides long, present in the ORF or the 3’UTR of either CD95L or
CD95 starting with the first 21 nucleotides after the start codon, and then shifting the sequence by
one nucleotide along the entire ORF and 3’UTR (Figure 6A). We also included shRNAs from a gene
not expressed in mammalian cells and not expected to contain toxic sequences, Venus. All 4666 oli-
gonucleotides (700 Venus, 825 CD95L ORF, 837 CD95L 3’UTR, 987 CD95 ORF, and 1317 CD95
3’UTR shRNAs) were cloned into the Tet-inducible pTIP vector (Figure 6B) as five individual pools.
We first tested the activity of each individual pool to be toxic and to target the Venus sensor protein
(fused to either the ORF of CD95 or CD95L). NB7 cells were again used because of their resistance
to the Venus-CD95L sensor, which was found to be slightly toxic to CD95 apoptosis competent cells.
NB7-Venus-CD95L cells infected with the Venus-targeting shRNA pool showed some reduction in
fluorescence when Dox was added, however, the shRNA pool derived from the CD95L ORF was
much more active in knocking down Venus (Figure 6—figure supplement 1A). No significant green
fluorescence reduction was detected in cells after infection with the shRNA pool derived from the
CD95L 3’UTR since the targeted sequences were not part of the sensor. Similar results were
obtained when NB7-Venus-CD95 cells were infected with the Venus, CD95 ORF, and CD95 3’UTR
targeting shRNA pools. To determine their ability to reduce cell growth (as a surrogate marker for
toxicity), we infected NB7 parental cells with each of the five pools (parental cells were used for this
experiment to avoid a possible sponge effect by expressing either CD95L or CD95 sequences that
were part of the Venus sensors). Interestingly, the pool of 700 shRNAs derived from Venus did not
cause any toxicity (Figure 6—figure supplement 1B). In contrast, the pool of the shRNAs derived
from CD95L significantly slowed down growth, while no toxicity was observed when cells were
infected with the pool of shRNAs derived from the CD95L 3’UTR. In the case of CD95, both the
shRNAs derived from the ORF and the 3’UTR showed some toxicity. However, the shRNAs derived
from the 3’UTR caused greater toxicity compared to those derived from the ORF. The data suggest
that overall the shRNAs derived from the CD95L ORF and the CD95 3’UTR contain the most toxic
sequences.
To determine the toxicity of each of the shRNAs in the pools, NB7 cells were infected with the
libraries of shRNA viruses (MOI <1), and after puromycin selection cells were pooled 1:1:1 (Venus
ORF/CD95L ORF/CD95L 3’UTR pools or Venus ORF/CD95 ORF/CD95 3’UTR pools) to allow for
competition between shRNAs when Dox was added (Figure 6B). Cells were cultured for 9 days with
and without Dox to allow for cell death to occur. To identify depleted shRNAs, shRNA barcodes
were detected through next generation sequencing of PCR products to determine the relative abun-
dance of each shRNA in three pools: 1) the cloned plasmid libraries, 2) cells after infection and cul-
ture for 9 days without Dox, and 3) cells infected and cultured with Dox for 9 days. A total of
71,168,032 reads were detected containing a complete sequence of one of the cloned shRNAs. Vir-
tually all shRNAs were substantially represented in the cloned plasmids (Supplementary file 3). The
shRNAs in the CD95L pool (comprised of the Venus, CD95L ORF, and CD95L 3’UTR subpools) and
the CD95 pool (comprised of the Venus, CD95 ORF, and CD95 3’UTR subpools) were ranked from
highest (most toxic) to lowest underrepresentation. During this and subsequent analyses, we noticed
in many cases, Dox addition did cause a reduction of shRNAs, indicating an increase in toxicity; how-
ever, in other instances, infection alone and without the addition of Dox was toxic. This effect was
likely due to the well-described leakiness of the Tet-on system (Pham et al., 2008), which we con-
firmed for shR6 in NB7 cells (Figure 6—figure supplement 2A). To capture all toxic shRNAs, we
therefore decided to split the analysis into two halves: 1) the changes in abundance after infection
compared to the composition in the plasmid pool (infection -Dox) and 2) the changes in abundance
after Dox addition compared to the infected –Dox cells (infection +Dox). In subsequent analyses,
shRNAs underrepresented after infection are either boxed (Figure 6C) or shown (Figures 6D and
7B and Figure 7—figure supplement 1B) in blue and the ones underrepresented after Dox addition
are either boxed or shown in orange. The results for all shRNAs are shown in Figure 6—figure sup-
plement 2B. Grey dots represent all shRNAs and red dots represent only the ones that were signifi-
cantly underrepresented at least 5-fold. Interestingly, the highest abundance of downregulated

 shRNAs was found in the CD95L ORF and the CD95 3’UTR pools of shRNAs, which is consistent with
the increased toxicity observed when NB7 cells were infected with either of these two pools individ-
ually (see Figure 6—figure supplement 1B). The shRNAs of these two toxic pools were highly
enriched in the underrepresented shRNAs in the two pooled experiments (CD95L and CD95). Their
toxicity was also evident when all shRNAs in each pool (2362 shRNAs in the CD95L and 3004
shRNAs in the CD95 pool) were ranked according to the highest fold downregulation (Figure 6C).
The three subpools in each experiment are shown separately. Thus, again this analysis identified the
ORF of CD95L and the 3’UTR of CD95 as the subpool in each analysis with the highest enrichment
of underrepresented shRNAs (Figure 6C).
This analysis allowed us to describe the toxicity landscape of CD95L and CD95 ORFs and their
3’UTRs (Figure 6D). All shRNAs significantly underrepresented at least five-fold (red dots in Fig-
ure 6—figure supplement 2B) are shown along the CD95L pool (Figure 6D, left) and the CD95
pool (Figure 6D, right) sequences. For both CD95L and CD95, toxic shRNAs localized into distinct
clusters. The highest density of toxic sequences was found in the stretch of RNA that codes for the
intracellular domain of CD95L (underlined in green in Figure 6D).
Predicting shRNA toxicity - the toxicity index (TI) and GC content
Our data suggest toxic shRNAs derived from either CD95L or CD95 kill cancer cells by targeting a
network of genes critical for survival through canonical RNAi. Therefore, we wondered how many
8mer seed sequences derived from these toxic shRNAs would have corresponding seed matches in
the 3’UTR of critical survival genes in the human genome. Would it be possible to predict with some
certainty in an in silico analysis what shRNAs would be toxic to cells? To calculate such a hypothetical
toxicity index, we used the ranked CRISPR data set (Wang et al., 2015) with 1882 survival genes
(SGs) and 423 nonSGs. Based on our RNA-Seq analyses, we hypothesized the survival genes con-
tained more putative seed matches for toxic shRNAs in their 3’UTRs than the nonsurvival genes
(Figure 7A, left) and that the number of seed matches in the 3’UTRs of survival genes divided by the
number of seed matches in the 3’UTR of nonsurvival genes would, to some extent, predict toxicity
of an si/shRNA (Figure 7A, right).
To establish a Toxicity Index (TI) for each shRNA, we first gathered 3’UTR sequences for 1846 of
the survival genes and 416 of the nonsurvival genes. We then generated a list containing a normal-
ized ratio of occurrences of every possible 8mer seed match in the 3’UTRs of the survival and non-
survival gene groups. This resulted in a ratio for each of the 65,536 possible 8mer combinations
(Supplementary file 4), the TI. We then assigned to each of the 4666 shRNAs in our screen its TI,
and ranked each pool within the two experiments of our screen according to the highest TI (red stip-
pled lines in Figure 7B). We then further separated the shRNAs into two groups: those that were
toxic just after infection and those toxic after addition of Dox (Figure 7B, Supplementary file 5). In
each ranked list, we could now assess whether the experimentally determined toxicity of shRNAs
correlated with the in silico predicted TI. Remarkably, the highest enrichment of toxic shRNAs was
found amongst those with higher TI for the subpool of shRNAs targeting the CD95L ORF followed
by shRNAs in the subpool targeting the CD95 3’UTR. To confirm the significance of this finding, we
repeated the analysis 10,000 times by randomly assigning 8mers and their associated TIs to the two

 shRNA pools and again sorted the data from highest to lowest TI. The reported p-values were calcu-
lated based on these permutated datasets using Mann-Whitney U tests.
We noticed that survival genes tend to be more highly expressed than nonsurvival genes (data
not shown). To address the question whether toxic si/shRNAs only target survival genes or all genes
that are highly expressed, we recalculated the TI based on a set of 850 highly expressed and expres-
sion matched survival and nonsurvival genes (Figure 7—figure supplement 1A). This alternative TI
tracked slightly less well with the toxic shRNAs we identified, but the enrichment of toxic shRNAs
towards the top of the list ranked according to the new TI was still statistically significant (Figure 7—
figure supplement 1B). This analysis demonstrates survival genes contain more seed matches for

 toxic shRNAs in their 3’UTR than nonsurvival genes regardless of the expression level. This suggests,
to a certain extent, it is possible to predict the experimental toxicity of shRNAs based on the in silico
calculated TI.
Our data suggest DISE results from a sequence-specific off-target activity that depends on the
presence of certain seed matches in the 3’UTR of survival genes. Thus, DISE inducing RISC associ-
ated small RNAs behave in manner similar to miRNAs. This raised the question whether these seed
matches have special properties. While we did not find a sequence motif that was present in all toxic
si/shRNAs, we did find that sequence composition, specifically GC content, which has been reported
to affect the specificity of shRNAs (Gu et al., 2014; Ui-Tei et al., 2004), correlated with the toxicity
of shRNAs. When the GC content of the 6mer seed sequences of all underrepresented shRNAs
detected in the shRNA screen across the CD95L ORF was plotted, we found a significant correlation
between the GC content and higher toxicity (indicated by underrepresentation) (Figure 7C and D).
This correlation was even more pronounced when plotting GC content versus the 6mer toxicity index
(Supplementary file 4) (Figure 7E). While not an absolute requirement, higher GC content made
shRNAs more toxic, consistent with reports demonstrating that shRNAs with high GC content in the
seed region showed decreased on-target and increased off-target activity (Gu et al., 2014; Ui-
Tei et al., 2004). In summary, our data suggest that si- and/or shRNAs with certain seed sequences
are toxic to cancer cells by targeting critical survival genes through an RNAi mechanism independent
of both Drosha and Dicer. Furthermore, the data suggest high miRNA content, presumably through
competing for occupancy in the RISC, might render cells less sensitive to DISE.
Discussion
Most current uses of RNAi are aimed toward highly specific silencing with little OTE. In fact, OTEs
represent one of the largest impediments to the use of RNAi in phenotypic screening applications.
We now demonstrate DISE is a unique form of OTE that results in the simultaneous activation of mul-
tiple cell death pathways in cancer cells. The discovery that DISE involves loss of multiple survival
genes now provides an explanation for the unique properties we described for this form of cell
death, especially the observation that cancer cells have a hard time developing resistance to this cell
death mechanism (Hadji et al., 2014; Murmann et al., 2017).
DISE represents a specific form of RNAi OTE
There are a number of rules that have been elucidated for designing si/shRNAs (Bramsen et al.,
2009) to avoid undesired effects such as OTE (Petri and Meister, 2013), general toxicity due to the
presence of toxic sequence motifs (Fedorov et al., 2006; Petri and Meister, 2013), poisoning/satu-
rating of the RISC (Grimm et al., 2006), or evocation of an IFN response (Marques and Williams,
2005). The following arguments and evidence support our prediction that DISE is a manifestation of
a novel, functionally important, conserved mechanism of genome regulation, and not the result of
one of the above-mentioned effects:
1. The sheer number of toxic shRNAs embedded in CD95L or CD95. A number of genome-wide
shRNA and siRNA lethality screens have revealed that 2–5% of shRNAs targeting human genes
are toxic to cells. We recently reported in 12 independent arrayed shRNA lethality screens the
identification of 651 genes out of about 18,000 targeted genes that are critical for the survival
of 8 different cancer cell lines (Hadji et al., 2014). Many of the genes targeted by these
shRNAs were actually established survival genes (as discussed in [Hadji et al., 2014]). That
means that the number of shRNAs that are toxic due to a possible OTE or general toxicity
would be expected to be very small. In contrast, we found that >80% of the shRNAs and
siRNAs that were designed to target either CD95 or CD95L exhibited toxicity in multiple cell
lines. Consistent with our data analysis, a parallel genome-scale loss of function screen con-
firmed that the majority of the tested shRNAs derived from either CD95L and CD95 were toxic
to a majority of the tested 216 cell lines when used as a pooled library (Cowley et al., 2014).
These also included a number of hematopoietic cell lines suggesting that the DISE effect is not
limited to solid cancers. Interestingly, in this study the authors did not consider the data on
most of the CD95L and CD95 targeting shRNAs to be significant as they received a low consis-
tency score. A high consistency score predicts the observed phenotype (cell death or growth
reduction in this case) is caused by knocking down the targeted gene (Shao et al., 2013).
However, we have demonstrated here that the toxicity of an shRNA is solely dependent on its

 seed and the transcriptome of the treated cells. Therefore, the results of every shRNA should
be considered individually as far as the DISE inducing effect is concerned.
2. High concentrations of siRNAs can saturate the RISC, preventing the access of crucial endoge-
nous miRNAs (Khan et al., 2009). We have demonstrated that, in general, 5 nM of CD95L-
derived siRNAs are sufficient to kill cancer cells. We have even seen very efficient cell death
with as little as 1 nM of siRNA (see Figure 2I and Figure 1—figure supplement 2E). It is
therefore unlikely we are poisoning the RISC. It has been reported that in siRNA overexpres-
sion experiments, changes in mRNA expression can be caused by blocked access of endoge-
nous miRNAs to the RISC, such as the highly expressed miRNA family, let-7 (Khan et al.,
2009). However, we can exclude such an effect in our analysis, as there was no significant
enrichment (or depletion) of the let-7 seed match motif (or that of any other miRNA) in our
analyses (black lines in Figure 5A).
3. No IFN response was observed. We have performed multiple RNA-Seq and gene array analy-
ses of cells in which DISE was induced by multiple si/shRNAs targeting CD95 or CD95L. In
none of these analyses did we detect an increase in any of the known IFN response genes
(Schoggins et al., 2011) (data not shown). In addition, we demonstrated the latest generation
of Dicer optimized 27mer DsiRNAs that do not elicit an IFN response (Kim et al., 2005) and
the shRNAs expressed from within the cells shown to have low IFN triggering activity
(Robbins et al., 2006) have the same toxic activities as the standard 21mer siRNAs (see Fig-
ure 1—figure supplement 1A and 1B).
4. Mutation of just one position destroys activity. A major argument against DISE toxicity being
caused by overloading the RISC, an IFN response or the presence of known toxic sequences,
lies in the analysis of the chimeras we generated between siL3 and a non-toxic scrambled oli-
gonucleotide (see Figure 3H). This analysis demonstrated that the seed match positions of
siL3 are critical for its toxicity. In fact, just replacing one nucleotide in a critical position in the
center of the seed match almost completely abolished toxicity of the siRNA.
What are the requirements for an si/shRNA to induce DISE?
Our data provide strong evidence that the toxicity observed is a sequence-specific event caused by
seed matches present in the targets of the toxic si/shRNAs rather than by a toxic motif enriched in
all toxic si/shRNAs (i.e. the UGGC motif described before [Fedorov et al., 2006]). We did find a cor-
relation between the toxicity of shRNAs (both predicted by the TI and experimentally determined in
the shRNA screen) and the GC content in their seed region. While this correlation was significant, it
was not a requirement as some of the most toxic si- and shRNAs had a low 8mer seed GC content
(shL3, 25%; shR6, 25%; siL3, 37.5%). Our data suggest that survival genes may contain different
types of seed matches (based on base composition or sequence) when compared to nonsurvival
genes. Such a distinction has indeed been described before (Stark et al., 2005). In a study in Dro-
sophila, it was determined that survival genes are depleted of seed matches targeted by highly
expressed miRNAs. These authors concluded that evolution must have selected against the presence
of seed matches for highly expressed miRNAs in the 3’UTR of survival genes. It is therefore not sur-
prising that a gene ontology (GO) analysis of all miRNA targets (the ‘targets’) in this study described
these genes as being involved in development and differentiation (Stark et al., 2005). In contrast,
genes not targeted by miRNAs (the ‘antitargets’) grouped in GO clusters that were consistent with
cell survival (Stark et al., 2005). A similar phenomenon was also shown in mammalian cells; genes
with fewer miRNA target sites, as predicted by Targetscan, contained distinct enriched GO terms
from those enriched in genes with many predicted target sites. The genes with fewer sites were
enriched in GO terms like ribosomal subunits and respiratory chain, whereas target-heavy genes
were more enriched in regulatory-related GO terms (Zare et al., 2014). It is possible the DISE-induc-
ing si/shRNAs carry seed sequences that preferentially target seed matches present in the 3’UTRs of
the ‘anti-targets’. However, as our data on the miR-30 based shRNAs suggest, DISE-inducing
shRNAs must be expressed at a certain level to be toxic.
DISE is caused by loading of the guide strand of toxic si/shRNAs into
the RISC
Part of our data was generated using a widely used first generation stem loop shRNA platform, the
TRC library. The TRC shRNAs have recently been found to be prone to cause OTE. Gu et al. showed
that the loop design of this system results in imprecise Dicer cleavage and, consequently, the

 production of different mature small-RNA species that increase passenger loading, one major source
of OTE (Gu et al., 2012). More recently, it was reported that most guide RNAs derived from the
TRC hairpin were shifted by 4 nt 3’ of the expected 5’ start site (Watanabe et al., 2016). While we
did see a shift in processing of these stem loop shRNAs, we did not see such a high level of impreci-
sion in the cleavage of our toxic shRNAs. In fact, 99.4% of the shR6 guide RNAs started at the same
nucleotide position (Figure 5—figure supplement 1A). The majority of the processing of both our
pTIP and pLKO-based shRNAs was shifted by one nucleotide (Figure 5—figure supplement 1A).
This shift was consistent with the defined seed matches that were detected in the Sylamer analyses.
In general, one major seed match was detected with one other minor species (this was less obvious
for shL1, Figure 5—figure supplement 2). Furthermore, all four Sylamer analyses only detected
enrichments in the 3’UTR of downregulated mRNAs that were consistent with only the guide strand
targeting the mRNA and not the passenger strand. In all cases, including in cells transfected with the
siRNA siL3, the primary enriched sequence motifs were either 7, or 8mers present in the 3’UTR of
the targeted mRNAs.
DISE has features of the RNAi OTE previously reported
Our data on DISE are consistent with a number of properties of RNAi OTE that have previously been
reported. Similar to DISE, OTE-mediated silencing requires a 6/7nt seed sequence of complementar-
ity (Birmingham et al., 2006; Jackson et al., 2006; Lin et al., 2005) and it targets mRNAs in the
3’UTR (Birmingham et al., 2006). Our data on shRNAs, siRNAs, and DsiRNAs suggest that DISE is
not limited to one platform and requires sequence-specific targeting. This conclusion is also consis-
tent with a previous report that suggested that sequence-dependent off-target transcript regulation
is independent of the delivery method (Jackson et al., 2006). The authors found the same enrich-
ment of 6mers and 7mers in 3’UTRs of targeted mRNAs for siRNAs and shRNAs (Jackson et al.,
2006).
The role of Dicer in DISE
We previously reported that DicerExo5-/- HCT116 cells (with deleted Exon 5) were at least as sensitive
to induction of DISE (by either shL3 or shR6) than wt cells suggesting that Dicer deficient cells could
be killed by DISE (Hadji et al., 2014). It has been reported that these Dicer deficient cells are hypo-
morphs (Ting et al., 2008) and indeed, we detected low residual Dicer expression by western blot-
ting (Hadji et al., 2014). We have now revisited this issue with HCT116 cells rendered completely
deficient for Dicer using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing (Kim et al., 2016). The fact that these Dicer-/-
cells were now completely resistant to the toxic effects of shL3 or shR6 demonstrates the complete
absence of Dicer protein and activity. Similar to the Drosha-/- cells, in the absence of mature miR-
NAs, which seem to attenuate DISE, Dicer-/- cells are hypersensitive to DISE induced by siRNAs.
Open questions regarding the relevance of DISE
We are proposing an entirely new concept of killing cancer cells that is based on the toxicity of
CD95 and CD95L derived small RNAs. Naturally, there are many open questions such as:
1. Is DISE part of an anti-cancer mechanism? We are proposing that DISE kills cancer cells in a
way that they usually cannot escape from. We have not found a way to block cancer cells from
dying by DISE. We provide strong evidence to suggest this is due to the simultaneous target-
ing of multiple survival genes that result in the activation of multiple cell death pathways. It will
be difficult to prove cells are dying due to the preferential targeting of survival genes. It may
never be possible to express multiple siRNA resistant survival genes at the same time at physi-
ological levels to render cancer cells resistant to the action of countless small RNAs. This pre-
diction alone makes DISE a promising new strategy to kill cancer cells.
2. Does CD95L induce DISE in vivo? We recently found that overexpression of the CD95L ORF is
toxic to cancer cells and that this kills cancer cells in a manner very similar to DISE induction
(unpublished data). We and others have noticed upregulation of CD95L in multiple stress-
related conditions such as treatment with chemotherapy ([Friesen et al., 1999] and data not
shown). While the amount of CD95L RNA and the level of upregulation alone may not be
enough to induce DISE, it could result from the combined expression of multiple RNAs that
when generated kill cells by DISE. We view CD95L as just one of many RNAs that have this
activity.

 3. Are there other genes in the human genome containing toxic seed sequences? We recently
identified other genes in the genome that contain DISE-inducing shRNAs (Patel and Peter,
2017). It is therefore possible that when cells are subjected to genotoxic or oncogenic stress
that they generate numerous small RNAs that can be taken up by the RISC and in combination
execute DISE. Hence, our analysis of CD95/CD95L will likely be applicable to other genes.
A model for why DISE preferentially kills cancer cells
We interpret the hypersensitivity of both Drosha-/- and Dicer-/- cells to DISE in the following way:
Most of the small RNAs in the cells that are loaded into the RISC are miRNAs. Using AGO pull-down
experiments, we determined 98.4% of AGO- associated RNAs in HCT116 cells to be miRNAs (99.3%
in HeyA8 cells, data not shown). It was recently reported that Drosha-/- cells showed a reduction of
miRNA content from roughly 70–80% to 5–6%, and Dicer-/- cells showed a reduction down to 14–
21% (Kim et al., 2016). Since neither Drosha-/- nor Dicer-/- cells express reduced AGO2 protein lev-
els (see inset in Figure 3E), it is reasonable to assume that their RISC can take up many more of the
toxic DISE inducing RNAs than the RISC in wt cells explaining the super toxicity of both DISE induc-
ing si/shRNAs and CD95L mRNAs in these cells.
We previously showed expression of either shL3 and shR6 induced DISE in immortalized normal
ovarian fibroblasts much more efficiently than in matching nonimmortalized cells (Hadji et al., 2014),
suggesting that this form of cell death preferentially affects transformed cells. Our data now provide
an interesting model to explain the higher sensitivity of cancer cells to DISE when compared to nor-
mal cells. It is well documented that cancer cells in general have global downregulation of miRNAs
when compared to normal tissues (Lu et al., 2005). This might free up the RISC for DISE-inducing
RNAs and would imply that miRNAs may protect normal cells from DISE.
Overall, our data allow us to predict that any small RNA with DISE-inducing RNAi activity that
does not require Dicer processing can kill cancer cells regardless of Dicer or Drosha status. In fact, in
an accompanying manuscript, we demonstrate that DISE can be triggered in vivo to treat ovarian
cancer

Recombinant soluble S2 CD95L and leucine-zipper tagged (Lz)CD95L were described before (Alge-
ciras-Schimnich et al., 2003). Reagents used: propidium iodide (Sigma-Aldrich #P4864), puromycin
(Sigma-Aldrich #P9620), G418 (Affymetrix #11379), doxycycline (Dox) (Sigma-Aldrich #9891), Lipo-
fectamine 2000 (ThermoFisher Scientific #11668027), and Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (ThermoFisher
Scientific #13778150).
Cell lines
The ovarian cancer cell line HeyA8 (RRID:CVCL_8878), the neuroblastoma cell line NB7 (RRID:CVCL_
8824), and the breast cancer cell line MCF-7 (RRID:CVCL_0031) were grown in RPMI 1640 medium
(Cellgro #10–040 CM), 10% heat-inactivated FBS (Sigma-Aldrich), 1% L-glutamine (Mediatech Inc),
and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Mediatech Inc). The human embryonic kidney cell line 293T (RRID:
CVCL_0063) and Phoenix AMPHO (RRID:CVCL_H716) cells were cultured in DMEM (Cellgro #10–
013 CM), 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 1% L-Glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.
HCT116 Drosha-/- and Dicer-/- cells were generated by Narry Kim (Kim et al., 2016). HCT116
parental (cat#HC19023, RRID:CVCL_0291), a Drosha-/- clone (clone #40, cat#HC19020) and two
Dicer-/- clones (clone #43, cat#HC19023 and clone #45, cat#HC19024) were purchased from Korean
Collection for Type Cultures (KCTC). All HCT116 cells were cultured in McCoy’s medium (ATCC,
cat#30–2007), 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 1% L-Glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. All cell
lines were authenticated using STR profiling and tested monthly for mycoplasm using PlasmoTest
(Invitrogen).
All lentiviruses were generated in 293T cells using pCMV-dR8.9 and pMD.G packaging plasmids.
Retroviruses were generated in Phoenix AMPHO cells using the VSVg packaging plasmid.
NB7 cells overexpressing wild type and mutant CD95L cDNAs used in Figure 1C and D were
generated by infecting cells seeded at 50,000 to 100,000 cells per well on a 6-well plate with empty
pLenti, pLenti-CD95L-WT, pLenti-CD95L-L1MUT, and pLenti-CD95L-L3MUT (described below) with
8 mg/ml polybrene. Selection was done with 3 mg/ml puromycin for at least 48 hr.
MCF-7 cells overexpressing CD95 cDNAs used in Figure 1F were generated by seeding cells at
50,000 per well in a 6-well plate followed by infection with pLNCX2-CD95 or pLNCX2-CD95R6MUT
(described below) in the presence of 8 mg/ml polybrene. Selection was done with 200 mg/ml G418
48 hrs after infection for 2 weeks.
The HeyA8 cells used in Figure 3D carried a lentiviral Venus-siL3 sensor vector (Murmann et al.,
2017) and were infected with NucLight Red lentivirus (Essen Bioscience #4476) with 8 mg/ml poly-
brene and selected with 3 mg/ml puromycin and sorted for high Venus expression 48 hr later. HeyA8
DshR6 clone #2 sensor cells used in Figure 3A–3C were infected with lentiviruses generated from
the Venus-CD95L sensor vector (described below) to over-express the Venus-CD95L chimeric tran-
script. Cells were sorted for high Venus expression 48 hr later. NB7 cells over-expressing either the
Venus-CD95L sensor or the Venus-CD95 sensor (described below) used in Figure 6—figure supple-
ment 1A were similarly generated.
Plasmids and constructs
The Venus-CD95L ORF and Venus-CD95 ORF (full length) sensor vectors were created by sub-clon-
ing the Venus-CD95L or the Venus-CD95 inserts (synthesized as a minigene by IDT with flanking
XbaI RE site on the 5’ end and EcoRI RE site at the 3’ end in the pIDTblue vector), which are com-
posed of the Venus ORF followed by either the CD95L ORF (accession number NM_000639.2) or
the CD95 ORF (accession number BC012479.1) as an artificial 3’UTR (both lacking the A in the start

 codon), respectively, into the modified CD510B vector (Ceppi et al., 2014) using XbaI and EcoRI.
Ligation was done with T4 DNA ligase.
The pLNCX2-CD95R6MUT vector was synthesized by replacing a 403 bp fragment of the CD95
ORF insert from the pLNCX2-CD95-WT vector (Hadji et al., 2014) with a corresponding 403 bp frag-
ment that had eight silent mutation substitutions at the shR6 site (5’-GTGTCGCTGTAAACCAAACTT
- > 5’-ATGTCGCTGCAAGCCCAATTT-3’) using BstXI (NEB #R0113) and BamHI (NEB #R3136)
restriction enzymes (mutant insert was synthesized in a pIDTblue vector with 5’ end BstXI site and 3’
end BamHI RE site).
Dox-inducible vectors expressing shRNAs were constructed by subcloning an annealed dou-
ble-stranded DNA insert containing the sequence encoding the shRNA hairpin (sense strand: 5’-

TTGACATTGATT-3’) into the pTIP-shR6 vector (Hadji et al., 2014). BsaBI (NEB #R0537) and
SphI-HF (NEB #R3182) were used to digest both the pTIP-shR6 vector (to excise the shR6 insert)
and the double-stranded shRNA DNA cassette insert followed by ligation with T4 DNA ligase.
The template oligos were purchased from IDT. The poly-N represents the two 21 bp sequences
that transcribe for the sense (N) and antisense (n) shRNA. miR-30 based shRNAs were generated
by The Gene Editing and Screening Core, at Memorial Sloan Kettering, NY, by converting the
21mers expressed in the pLKO and pTIP vectors into 22mers followed by cloning into the Dox-
inducible LT3REPIR vector as described (Dow et al., 2012). A vector expressing an shRNA
against Renilla luciferase was used as control (Dow et al., 2012).
CRISPR deletions
We identified two gRNAs that target upstream and downstream of the site to be deleted. These
gRNAs were expected to result in the deletion of a DNA piece just large enough to remove the tar-
get site. The CRISPR gRNA scaffold gene blocks were from IDT and consisted of the DNA sequence

TTGGCATTA-3’ (Mali et al., 2013); The poly-NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN represents the 19nt
target sequence. The two 19nt target sequences for excision of the shL3 site (D41 deletion) were 5’-
CCTTGTGATCAATGAAACT-3’ (gRNA #1) and 5’-GTTGTTGCAAGATTGACCC-3’ (gRNA #2). The
two target sequences for the D227 deletion of the shR6 site were 5’-GCACTTGGTATTCTGGGTC-3’
and 5’-TGTTTGCTCATTTAAACAC-3’. The two target sequences for D64 deletion of the siL3 site
were 5’-TAAAACCGTTTGCTGGGGC-3’ and 5’-TATCCCCAGATCTACTGGG-3’. Target sequences
were identified using the CRISPR gRNA algorithm found at http://crispr.mit.edu/; only gRNAs with
scores over 50 were used. These six gene blocks were sub-cloned into the pSC-B-amp/kan plasmid
using the StrataClone Blunt PCR Cloning kit (Agilent Technologies #240207).
The target sites of siL3, shL3, and shR6 were homozygously deleted from target cells by co-trans-
fecting Cas9 plasmid with each corresponding pair of pSC-B-gRNA plasmids. Briefly, 400,000 cells
were seeded per well on a 6-well plate the day prior to transfection. Each well was transfected with
940 ng of Cas9-GFP plasmid (pMJ920) (Jinek et al., 2013) and 450 ng of each pSC-B-gRNA plasmid
using Lipofectamine 2000. Media was replaced next day. One to two days later, cells were sorted
for the top 50% population with the highest green fluorescence. Those cells were cultured for an
additional week to let them recover. The cells were then sorted by FACS (BD FACSAria SORP sys-
tem) directly into 96-well plates containing a 1:1 ratio of fresh media:conditioned media for single
cell cloning. Approximately two to three weeks later, single cell clones were expanded and sub-
jected to genotyping. PCR using both a primer pair that flanked the region to be deleted and
another pair containing one flanking primer and one internal primer was used to screen clones for
homozygous deletion. For detection of the D41 deletion of the shL3 site, the flanking external pri-
mers were 5’-TCTGGAATGGGAAGACACCT-3’ (Fr primer) and 5’- CCTCCATCATCACCAGATCC-3’
(Rev primer), and the internal Rev primer was 5’-ATATACAAAGTACAGCCCAGT-3’. For detection of

 the D227 deletion of the shR6 site, the flanking external primers were 5’-GGTGTCATGCTGTGACTG

clones #1 and 2 were not complete shR6 deletion mutants, but frame-shift mutations did occur in
each allele (as in clone #11) making them CD95 knockout clones as depicted in Figure 2—figure

TRCN0000255408 (shR8’: ATATCTTTGAAAGTTTGTATT). Infection was carried out according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. In brief, 50,000 to 100,000 cells seeded the day before in a 6-well plate
were infected with each lentivirus at an M.O.I of 3 in the presence of 8 mg/ml polybrene overnight.
Media change was done the next day, followed by selection with 3 mg/ml puromycin 24 hrs later.
Selection was done for at least 48 hrs until puromycin killed the non-infected control cells. For infec-
tion of NB7 cells over-expressing pLenti-CD95L cDNAs with pLKO lentiviral particles as in Figure 1C
and D, cells were seeded at 5000 per well on a 24-well plate and infected with an M.O.I. of 20 to
ensure complete infection. For infection of MCF-7 cells over-expressing pLNCX2-CD95 cDNAs with
pLKO lentiviruses as in Figure 1G, cells were seeded at 7000 per well on a 24-well plate and
infected at an M.O.I. of three. 3 mg/ml puromycin was added 48 hrs after infection. For infection of
HCT116, Drosha-/-, and Dicer-/- cells in Figure 3E, cells were seeded at 100,000 per well in a 24-well
plate and infected at an M.O.I of three. 3 mg/ml puromycin was added 48 hrs after infection.
Knockdown with pTIP-shRNA viruses
Cells were plated at 50,000 to 100,000 cells per well in a 6-well plate. Cells were infected with lenti-
virus generated in 293T cells from the desired pTIP-shRNA vector in the presence of 8 mg/ml Poly-
brene. Media was replaced 24 hrs later. Selection was done 48 hrs after infection with 3 mg/ml
puromycin. Induction of shRNA expression was achieved by adding 100 ng/ml Dox to the media.
For infection with the LT3REPIR-shRNA viruses cells were plated and infected as described above for
pTIP-shRNA viruses. After selection with 3 mg/ml puromycin was complete, they were plated in 96-
well plates and the shRNA expression was induced by adding Dox (100 ng/ml) to the media. The cell
confluency over time was measured using Incucyte.
Transfection with short oligonucleotides
siRNAs were either purchased from Dharmacon (Figures 2I and 4D, Figure 1—figure supplement
1A, Figure 5—figure supplement 2) or synthesized by IDT (Figure 3 and Figure 5—figure supple-
ment 1B) as sense and antisense RNA (or DNA for Figure 3B) oligos and annealed. The sense RNA
oligonucleotides had 3’ two deoxy-T overhangs. The antisense RNA oligos were phosphorylated at

 the 5’ end and had 3’ two deoxy-A overhangs. siRNAs targeting CD95L (and controls) were as fol-
lows: siRNA (Scr, sense: UGGUUUACAUGUUGUGUGA), siL1 (sense: UACCAGUGCUGAUCAUUUA),
siL2 (sense: CAACGUAUCUGAGCUCUCU), siL3 (sense: GCCCUUCAAUUACCCAUAU), siL4 (sense:

oligos (sense: GCCCTTCAATTACCCATAT) and Scr DNA oligos (sense: TGGTTTACATGTTGTGTGA)
were used in Figure 3B. Blunt siL3 and siScr RNA oligos without the deoxynucleotide overhangs as
well as siL2 and siL3 RNA oligos with Cy5-labelled 5’ or 3’ ends (IDT) were used in Figure 3C.
DsiRNA used in Figure 1—figure supplement 1 were Dsi13.X (sense RNA oligo: CAGGACUGAG

UUAACGAC, IDT #51-01-14-03). Predesigned siRNA SmartPools targeting the 11 downregulated
genes were obtained from Dharmacon and used in Figure 4C and Figure 4—figure supplement 2B
and C. Each siRNA SmartPool consisted of 4 siRNAs with On-Targetplus modification. The following
SmartPools were used: L-014208–02 (NUCKS1); L-012212–00 (CAPZA1); L-018339–00 (CCT3);
L-013615–00 (FSTL1); L-011548–00 (FUBP1); L-017242–00 (GNB1); L-014597–01 (NAA50); L-020893–
01 (PRELID3B); L-019719–02 (SNRPE); L-003941–00 (TFRC); L-006630–00 (HIST1H1C). On-Targetplus
non-targeting control pool (D-001810–10) was used as negative control. Transfection efficiency was
assessed by transfecting cells with siGLO Red (Dharmacon) followed by FACS analysis.
HeyA8 cells (and modified cells derived from parental HeyA8 cells) were seeded at 750 cells per
well on a 96-well plate one day before transfection. Cells were transfected using 0.1 ml of Lipofect-
amine RNAiMAX reagent per well. HCT116 cells (and modified cells derived from parental HCT116
cells) were seeded at 4000 cells per well on a 96-well plate one day before transfection. 0.2 ml of Lip-
ofectamine RNAiMAX was used for transfection. Media was changed the day after transfection.
Soluble CD95L protein rescue experiments
NB7 cells were seeded at 500 cells per well in a 96-well plate. Next day, cells were infected with the
scrambled pLKO lentiviruses or pLKO-shL1 lentiviruses at an M.O.I. of 20 (to achieve 100% transduc-
tion efficiency under conditions omitting the puromycin selection step) in the presence of 8 mg/ml
polybrene and 100 ng/ml of S2 CD95L or LzCD95L for 16 hr. Media was replaced the next day with
media containing varying concentrations of recombinant CD95L.
Real-time PCR
Total RNA was extracted and purified using QIAZOL Lysis reagent (QIAGEN) and the miRNeasy kit
(QIAGEN). 200 ng of total RNA was used to generate cDNA using the high-capacity cDNA reverse
Transcription kit (Applied Biosystems #4368814). cDNA was quantified using Taqman Gene expres-
sion master mix (ThermoFisher Scientific #4369016) with specific primers from ThermoFisher Scien-

To perform arrayed real-time PCR (Figure 4—figure supplement 1), total RNA was extracted
and used to make cDNA as described for standard real-time PCR. For Taqman Low Density Array

(Hs00951083_m1) after the cards reached room temperature. The PCR reactions were performed
using Quantstudio 7 (ThermoFisher Scientific). Since each of the port loads each sample in duplicates
on the TLDA card and because two biological replicates of each sample were loaded onto two sepa-
rate ports, quadruplicate Ct values were obtained for each sample. Statistical analysis was per-
formed using Student’s t test. Cells were plated at 600,000 per 15 mm dish (Greiner CELLSTAR,
cat#P7237, Sigma) after one day of puromycin selection. Total RNA was harvested at 50 hrs after
plating for RNAseq analysis.
Western blot analysis
Protein extracts were collected by lysing cells with RIPA lysis buffer (1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1%
deoxycholic acid). Protein concentration was quantified using the DC Protein Assay kit (Bio-
Rad, Hercules, CA). 30 mg of protein were resolved on 8–12% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to
nitrocellulose membranes (Protran, Whatman) overnight at 25 mA. Membranes were incubated with
blocking buffer (5% non-fat milk in 0.1% TBS/Tween-20) for 1 hr at room temperature. Membranes
were then incubated with the primary antibody diluted in blocking buffer over night at 4˚C. Mem-
branes were washed 3 times with 0.1% TBS/Tween-20. Secondary antibodies were diluted in block-
ing buffer and applied to membranes for 1 hr at room temperature. After 3 more additional washes,
detection was performed using the ECL reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and visualized with
the chemiluminescence imager G:BOX Chemi XT4 (Synoptics).
CD95 surface staining
Cell pellets of about 106 cells were resuspended in about 100 ml of PBS on ice. After resuspension, 4
ml of either anti-CD95 primary antibody (BD #556640) conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate
(FitC), or the matching Isotype control (BD #551954), Mouse IgG1 k conjugated with FitC, were
added. Cells were incubated on ice at 4˚C, in the dark, for 25 min, washed twice with PBS, and per-
cent green cells were determined by flow cytometry (Becton, Dickinson).
Cell death quantification (DNA fragmentation)
A cell pellet (500,000 cells) was resuspended in 0.1% sodium citrate, pH 7.4, 0.05% Triton X-100,
and 50 mg/ml propidium iodide. After resuspension, cells were incubated 2 to 4 hrs in the dark at
4˚C. The percent of subG1 nuclei (fragmented DNA) was determined by flow cytometry.
Cell growth and fluorescence over time
After treatment/infection, cells were seeded at 500 to 4000 per well in a 96-well plate at least in trip-
licate. Images were captured at indicated time points using the IncuCyte ZOOM live cell imaging
system (Essen BioScience) with a 10x objective lens. Percent confluence, red object count, and the
green object integrated intensity were calculated using the IncuCyte ZOOM software (version
2015A).
RNA-Seq analysis
The following describes the culture conditions used to produce samples for RNA-Seq in Figure 4.
HeyA8 DshR6 clone #11 cells were infected with pLKO-shScr or pLKO-shR6. A pool of three 293T
DshL3 clones was infected with either pTIP-shScr or pTIP-shL3. After selection with puromycin for 2
days, the pTIP-infected 293T cells were plated with Dox in duplicate at 500,000 cells per T175 flask.
The pLKO-infected HeyA8 cells were plated at 500,000 cells per flask. Total RNA was harvested 50
hrs and 100 hrs after plating. In addition, 293T cells were infected with either pLKO-shScr or pLKO-
shL1 and RNA was isolated (100 hrs after plating) as described above for the infection with shR6.

 oligonucleotides (Dharmacon) at 25 nM. The transfection mix was removed after 9 hrs and RNA har-
vested 48 hrs after transfection.
Total RNA was isolated using the miRNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Cat.No. 74004) following the manu-
facturer’s instructions. An on-column digestion step using the RNAse-free DNAse Set (Qiagen, Cat.
No.: 79254) was included for all RNA-Seq samples.
RNA libraries were generated and sequenced (Genomics Core facility at the University of Chi-
cago). The quality and quantity of the RNA samples were checked using an Agilent bio-analyzer.
Paired end RNA-SEQ libraries were generated using Illumina TruSEQ TotalRNA kits using the Illu-
mina provided protocol (including a RiboZero rRNA removal step). Small RNA-SEQ libraries were
generated using Illumina small RNA SEQ kits using the Illumina provided protocol. Two types of
small RNA-SEQ sub-libraries were generated: one containing library fragments 140–150 bp in size
and one containing library fragments 150–200 bp in size (both including the sequencing adaptor of
about 130 bp). All three types of libraries (one RNA-SEQ and two small RNA-SEQ) were sequenced
on an Illumina HiSEQ4000 using Illumina provided reagents and protocols. Adaptor sequences were
removed from sequenced reads using TrimGalore (https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/proj-
ects/trim_galore), and the trimmed reads were mapped to the hg38 assembly of the human genome
with Tophat and bowtie2. Raw read counts were then assigned to genes using HTSeq. Differential
gene expression was analyzed with the R Bioconductor DESeq2 package (Love et al., 2014) using
shrinkage estimation for dispersions and fold changes to improve stability and interpretability of esti-
mates. P values and adjusted P values were calculated using the DESeq2 package.
To identify differentially abundant RNAs in cells expressing either shL3 or shR6, using a method
unbiased by genome annotation, we also analyzed the raw 100 bp reads for differential abundance.
First, the second end in each paired end read was reverse complemented, so that both reads were
on the same strand. Reads were then sorted and counted using the core UNIX utilities sort and uniq.
Reads with fewer than 128 counts across all 16 samples were discarded. A table with all of the
remaining reads was then compiled, summing counts from each sequence file corresponding to the
same sample. This table contained a little over 100,000 reads. The R package edgeR (http://bioinfor-
matics.oxfordjournals.org/content/26/1/139) was used to identify differentially abundant reads, and
then these reads were mapped to the human genome using blat (http://genome.cshlp.org/content/
12/4/656.abstract) to determine chromosomal location whenever possible. Homer (http://homer.
salk.edu/homer/) was used to annotate chromosomal locations with overlapping genomic elements
(such as genes). Raw read counts in each sequence file were normalized by the total number of
unique reads in the file.
To identify the most significant changes in expression of RNAs both methods of RNAs-Seq analy-
ses (alignment and read based) were used to reach high stringency. All samples were prepared in
duplicate and for each RNA the average of the two duplicates was used for further analysis. In the
alignment-based analysis, only RNAs that had a base mean of >2000 reads and were significantly
deregulated between the groups (adjusted p-value<0.05) were considered for further analysis. RNAs
were scored as deregulated when they were more than 1.5 fold changed in the shL3 expressing cells
at both time points and in the shR6 expressing cells at either time points (each compared to shScr
expressing cells) (Supplementary file 1). This was done because we found that the pLKO-driven
expression of shR6 was a lot lower than the pTIP-driven expression of shL3 (see the quantification of
the two shRNAs in Figure 5—figure supplement 1A). This likely was a result of the reduced cellular
responses in the shR6 expressing cells. In the read-based analysis, reads were only considered if
they had both normalized read numbers of >10 across the samples in each treatment, as well as less
than two fold variation between duplicates and >1.5 fold change between treatment groups at both
time points and both cell lines (Supplementary file 1). After filtering, reads were mapped to the
genome and associated with genes based on chromosomal localization. Finally, all RNAs were
counted that showed deregulation in the same direction with both methods. This resulted in the
identification of 11 RNAs that were down and 1 that was upregulated in cells exposed to the
shRNAs shL3 and shR6. To determine the number of seed matches in the 3’UTR of downregulated
genes, the 3’UTRs of the 11 mRNAs were extracted from the Homo sapiens gene (GRCh38.p7) data-
set of the Ensembl 86 database using the Ensembl Biomart data mining tool. For each gene, only
the longest deposited 3’UTR was considered. Seed matches were counted in all 3’UTRs using in-
house Perl scripts.

 GSEA used in Figure 4D was performed using the GSEA v2.2.4 software from the Broad Institute
(http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea); 1000 permutations were used. The Sabatini gene lists
(Supplementary file 2) were set as custom gene sets to determine enrichment of survival genes ver-
sus the nonsurvival control genes in downregulated genes from the RNA seq data; Adjusted p-values
below 0.05 were considered significantly enriched. The GO enrichment analysis shown in Figure 4F
was performed using all genes that after alignment and normalization were found to be at least 1.5
fold downregulated with an adjusted p values of < 0.05, using the software available on www.Meta-
scape.org and default running parameters.
Conversion of shL3 and shR6 to siRNAs
From the RNA-Seq analysis with HeyA8 DshR6 infected with pLKO-shR6 and 293T DshL3 clones
infected pTIP-shL3, we analyzed the mature double-stranded RNAs derived from pLKO-shR6 and
pTIP-shL3 and found that the most abundant RNA forms were both shifted by one nucleotide. Based
on these most abundant species observed after cellular processing, we converted shL3 and shR6
sequences to siRNAs. The genomic target sequence in shL3 (21nt) is 5’-ACUGGGCUGUACUUUGUA
UAU-3’. For the shL3 => siL3 sense strand, one G was added before the A on the 5’ end while the
last U on the 3’ end was deleted, and second and third to the last ribonucleotides on the 3’ end
(UA) were replaced with deoxyribonucleotides for stabilization. For shL3 => siL3 antisense strand,
the last three nucleotides on the 5’ end (AUA) were deleted and one U and two dTs (UdTdT) were
added after the last U on the 3’end. The shL3 => siL3 sense strand is 5’- GACUGGGCUGUACUUUG
UAdTdA-3’
and
antisense
strand
is
5’-/5Phos/UACAAAGUACAGCCCAGUUdTdT-3’.
The
shR6 => siRNA was designed in a similar fashion except that two Gs instead of one G were added
to the 5’ end of the sense strand while UUdTdT instead of UdTdT was added to the 3’ end of the
antisense strand. The genomic target sequence in shR6 (21nt) is 5’-GUGCAGAUGUAAACCAAAC
UU-3’. The shR6 => siR6 sense strand is 5’-GGGUGCAGAUGUAAACCAAAdCdT-3’ and antisense
strand is 5’-/5Phos/UUUGGUUUACAUCUGCACUUdTdT-3’. Both shL3 => siL3 and ShR6 => siR6
siRNA duplexes were purchased from Dharmacon.
Construction of pTIP-shRNA libraries
The pTIP-shRNA libraries were constructed by subcloning libraries of 143nt PCR inserts of the form
5’-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXATAGAGATCGNNNNNNNNN
NNNNNNNNNNNNC
TCGAGNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNTTTTTGTACCGAGCTCGGATCCACTAGTCCAGTG
TGGGCATGCTGCGTTGACATTGATT-3’ into the pTIP-shR6 vector after excising the shR6 insert.
The poly-N region represents the 21-mer sense and antisense shRNA hairpin. The intervening
CTCGAG is the loop region of the shRNA. The 5 libraries targeting Venus, CD95L ORF, CD95L
3’UTR, CD95 ORF, or CD95 3’UTR were composed of every possible 21-mer shRNA (i.e. each near-
est neighbor shRNA was shifted by 1 nucleotide). These libraries were synthesized together on a
chip as 143 bp single-stranded DNA oligos (CustomArray Inc, Custom 12K oligo pool). Each shRNA
pool had its own unique 5’ end represented by the poly-X region. This allowed selective amplifica-
tion of a particular pool using 1 of 5 unique Fr primers (CD95L ORF: 5’-TGGCTTTATATATCTCCCTA
TCAGTG-3’, CD95L 3’ UTR: 5’-GGTCGTCCTATCTATTATTATTCACG-3’, CD95 ORF: 5’-TCTTGTG
TCCAGACCAATTTATTTCG-3’, CD95 3’UTR: 5’-CTCATTGACTATCGTTTTAGCTACTG-3’, Venus: 5’-
TATCATCTTTCATGATGACTTTCCGG-3’) and the common reverse primer 5’-AATCAATGTCAACG-
CAGCAT-3’. Phusion High Fidelity Polymerase (NEB #M0530) was used to amplify each library pool;
standard PCR conditions were used with an annealing temperature of 61˚C and 15 cycles. PCR reac-
tions were purified using PCR Cleanup kit (QIAGEN). The pTIP-shR6 vector and each of the amplified
libraries were digested with SphI-HF and BsaBI. Digested PCR products were run on either a 2%
Agarose gel or a 20% polyacrylamide (29:1) gel made with 0.5 x TBE buffer. PCR products were
extracted using either Gel Extraction kit (QIAGEN) for extraction from Agarose gels or via electro-
elution using D-Tube Dialyzer Mini columns (Novagen #71504). Purified PCR inserts were then
ligated to the linearized pTIP vector with T4 DNA ligase for 24 hr at 16˚C. The ligation mixtures
were transformed via electroporation in MegaX DH10B T1 cells (Invitrogen #C6400) and plated on
24 cm ampicillin dishes. At least 10 colonies per pool were picked and sequenced to verify successful
library construction. After verification, all colonies per library were pooled together and plasmid

 DNA extracted using the MaxiPrep kit (QIAGEN). The 5 pTIP-shRNA library DNA preps were used
to produce virus in 293T cells.
Lethality screen with pTIP-shRNA libraries
NB7 cells were seeded at 1.5 � 106 per 145 cm2 dish. Two dishes were infected with each of the 5
libraries with a transduction efficiency of about 10% to 20%. Media was replaced next day. Infected
cells were selected with 1.5 mg/ml puromycin. Cells infected with the Venus, CD95L ORF, and
CD95L 3’UTR-targeting libraries were pooled in a 1:1:1 ratio to make the CD95L cell pool. Likewise,
cells infected with the Venus, CD95 ORF, and CD95 3’UTR-targeting libraries were pooled to make
the CD95 receptor cell pool. The CD95 and the CD95L cell pools were plated separately each in 2
sets of duplicates seeded at 600,000 cells per 145 cm2 dish. One set received 100 ng/ml Dox, and
the other one was left untreated (total of 4 dishes per combined pool; 2 received no treatment and
2 received Dox). Cells infected with the different libraries were also plated individually in triplicate
with or without Dox on a 96-well plate to assess the overall toxicity of each pool. DNA was collected
from each 145 cm2 dish 9 days after Dox addition.
The shRNA barcodes were amplified from the harvested DNA template using NEB Phusion Poly-
merase with 4 different pairs of primers (referred to as N, N + 1, N + 2, and N + 3) in separate reac-
tions per DNA sample. The N pair consisted of the primers originally used to amplify the CD95L
ORF library (Fr: 5’-TGGCTTTATATATCTCCCTATCAGTG-3’ and Rev: 5’-AATCAATGTCAACG-
CAGCAT-3’). The N + 1 primers had a single nucleotide extension at each 5’ end of the N primers
corresponding to the pTIP vector sequence (Fr: 5’-TTGGCTTTATATATCTCCCTATCAGTG-3’ and
Rev: 5’-TAATCAATGTCAACGCAGCAT-3’). The N + 2 primers had 2 nucleotide extensions (Fr: 5’-C
TTGGCTTTATATATCTCCCTATCAGTG-3’ and Rev: 5’-ATAATCAATGTCAACGCAGCAT-3’), and the
N + 3 primers had 3 nucleotide extensions (Fr: 5’-TCTTGGCTTTATATATCTCCCTATCAGTG-3’ and
Rev: 5’-AATAATCAATGTCAACGCAGCAT-3’). The barcodes from the pTIP-shRNA library plasmid
preparations were also amplified using Phusion Polymerase with the N, N + 1, N + 2, and N + 3
primer pairs. The shRNA barcode PCR products were purified from a 2% Agarose gel and submitted
for 100 bp paired-end deep sequencing (Genomics Core facility at the University of Chicago). DNA
was quantitated using the Qubit. The 4 separate PCR products amplified using N, N + 1, N + 2, and
N + 3 were combined in equimolar amounts for each sample. Libraries were generated using the Illu-
mina TruSeq PCR-free kit using the Illumina provided protocol. The libraries were sequenced using
the HiSEQ4000 with Illumina provided reagents and protocols. Raw sequence counts for DNAs were
calculated by HTSeq. shRNA sequences in the PCR pieces of genomic DNA were identified by
searching all reads for the sense sequence of the mature shRNA plus the loop sequence CTCGAG.
To avoid a division by zero problem during the subsequent analyses all counts of zero in the raw
data were replaced with 1. A few sequences with a total read number <10 across all plasmids reads
were not further considered. In the CD95L pool this was only one shRNA (out of 2362 shRNAs)
(L792’) and in the CD95 20 shRNAs (out of 3004 shRNAs) were not represented (R88, R295, R493,
R494, R496, R497, R498, R499, R213’, R215’, R216’, R217’, R220’, R221’, R222’, R223’, R225’, R226’,
R258’, R946’, R1197’, R423’). While most shRNAs in both pools had a unique sequence two sequen-
ces occurred 6 times (L605’, L607’, L609’, L611’, L613’, L615’, and L604’, L606’, L608’, L610’, L612’,
L614’). In these cases, read counts were divided by 6. Two shRNAs could not be evaluated: 1) shR6
in the CD95 pool. It had a significant background due to the fact that pTIP-shR6 was used as a start-
ing point to clone all other shRNAs. 2) shL3 was found to be a minor but significant contaminant dur-
ing the infection of some of the samples. For each condition, two technical duplicates and two
biological duplicates were available. To normalize reads to determine the change in relative repre-
sentation of shRNAs between conditions, the counts of each shRNA in a subpool (all replicates and
all conditions) was divided by the total number of shRNAs in each subpool (%). First, the mean of
the technical replicates (R1 and R2) was taken. To analyze the biological replicates and to determine
the changes between conditions, two analyses were performed: 1) The change in shRNA representa-
tion between the cloned plasmid library and cells infected with the library and then cultured for 9
days without Dox (infection -Dox). Fold downregulation was calculated for each subpool as [(plasmid
%/-Dox1 %+plasmid %/-Dox2 %)/2]. 2) The difference in shRNA composition between the infected
cells cultured with (infection +Dox) and without Dox. Fold downregulation was calculated for each
subpool as [(-Dox1 %/+Dox1%)+(-Dox1 %/+Dox2%)+(-Dox2 %/+Dox1%)+(-Dox2 %/+Dox2%)/4].

 Only shRNAs were considered that were at least 5-fold underrepresented in either of the two analy-
ses (data in Supplementary file 3).
The toxicity index (TI) and GC content analysis
The TI in Figure 7A is defined by the sum of the counts of a 6mer or 8mer seed match in the 3’UTRs
of critical survival genes divided by the seed match counts in the 3’UTRs of nonsurvival genes. We
used the 1882 survival genes recently described in a CRISPR/Cas9 lethality screen by Wang et al.
(Wang et al., 2015). The survival genes were defined by having a CRISPR score of <�0.1 and an
adjusted p-value of <0.05. We chose as a control group to these top essential genes the bottom
essential genes using inverse criteria (CRISPR score of >0.1 and adjusted p-value of <0.05) and are
referring to them as the ‘nonsurvival genes’. Both counts were normalized for the numbers of genes
in each gene set. 3’UTRs were retrieved as described above. For the survival genes 1846 and for the
nonsurvival genes 416 3’UTRs were found. For each gene, only seed matches in the longest 3’UTR
were counted. The TI was calculated for each of the 4096 possible 6mer combinations and each of
the 65536 possible 8mer combinations (Supplementary file 4). These numbers were then assigned
to the results of the shRNA screen (Supplementary file 5). An alternative TI was calculated in Fig-
ure 7—figure supplement 1B and is based on the top 850 most highly expressed survival genes (all
expressed >1000 average reads) and 850 expression matched genes not described to be critical for
cancer cell survival were selected as controls.
For the analyses in Figure 7C and D, the GC content % was calculated for every 6mer in the
CD95L ORF shRNA pool. The GC content % was then plotted against the log(Fold down) for each
shRNA in the CD95L ORF shRNA after infection (compared to the plasmid composition) in
Figure 7C and after addition of Dox (compared to cells infected but not treated with Dox) in
Figure 7D. In Figure 7E, the log(TI) and GC content % was extracted for every possible 6mer and
plotted. Pearson correlation coefficient and associated p-value were calculated in R3.3.1.
Sylamer analysis
Sylamer is a tool to test for the presence of RNAi-type regulation effects from a list of differentially
expressed genes, independently from small RNA measurements (van Dongen et al., 2008) (http://
www.ebi.ac.uk/research/enright/software/sylamer). For short stretches of RNA (in this case length 6,
7, and 8 in length corresponding to the lengths of the determinants of seed region binding in RNAi-
type binding events), Sylamer tests for all possible motifs of this length whether the motif occur-
rences are shifted in sequences associated with the list under consideration, typically 3’UTRs when
analyzing RNAi-type binding events. A shift or enrichment of such a motif towards the down-regu-
lated end of the gene list is consistent with upregulation of a small RNA that has the motif as the
seed region. Sylamer tests in small increments along the list of genes, using a hypergeometric test
on the counts of a given word, comparing the leading part of the gene list to the universe of all
genes in the list. For full details, refer to (van Dongen et al., 2008). Enriched motifs stand out from
the back-ground of all motifs tested, as visible in the Sylamer plot. The plot consist of many different
lines, each line representing the outcomes of a series of tests for a single word, performed along
regularly spaced intervals (increments of 200 genes) of the gene list. Each test yields the log-trans-
formed P-value arising from a hypergeometric test as indicated above. If the word is enriched in the
leading interval, the log-transformed value has its value plotted on the positive y-axis (sign changed),
if the word is depleted the log-transformed value is plotted on the negative y-axis. 3’UTRs were
used from Ensembl, version 76. As required by Sylamer, they were cleaned of low-complexity
sequences and repetitive fragments using respectively Dust (Morgulis et al., 2006) with default
parameters and the RSAT interface (Medina-Rivera et al., 2015) to the Vmatch program, also run
with default parameters. Sylamer (version 12–342) was run with the Markov correction parameter set
to 4.
Statistical analyses
Continuous data were summarized as means and standard deviations (except for all IncuCyte experi-
ments where standard errors are shown) and dichotomous data as proportions. Continuous data
were compared using t-tests for two independent groups and one-way ANOVA for 3 or more
groups. For evaluation of continuous outcomes over time, two-way ANOVA was used with one

 factor for the treatment conditions of primary interest and a second factor for time treated as a cate-
gorical variable to allow for non-linearity. Comparisons of single proportions to hypothesized null
values were evaluated using binomial tests. Statistical tests of two independent proportions were
used to compare dichotomous observations across groups.
The effects of treatment on wild-type versus either Dicer-/- or Drosha-/- cells were statistically
assessed by fitting regression models that included linear and quadratic terms for value over time,
main effects for treatment and cell type, and two- and three-way interactions for treatment, cell-type
and time. The three-way interaction on the polynomial terms with treatment and cell type was evalu-
ated for statistical significance since this represents the difference in treatment effects over the
course of the experiment for the varying cell types.
To test if higher TI is enriched in shRNAs that were highly downregulated, p-values were calcu-
lated based on permutated datasets using Mann-Whitney U tests. The ranking of TI was randomly
shuffled 10,000 times and the W statistic from our dataset was compared to the distribution of the
W statistic of the permuted datasets. Test of enrichment was based on the filtered data of at least 5-
fold difference, which we define as a biologically meaningful. Fisher Exact Tests were performed to
assess enrichment of downregulated genes (i.e. >1.5 downregulated with adjusted p-value<0.05)
amongst genes with at least one si/shRNA seed match. All statistical analyses were conducted in
Stata 14 (RRID:SCR_012763) or R 3.3.1 in Rstudio (RRID:SCR_000432).
