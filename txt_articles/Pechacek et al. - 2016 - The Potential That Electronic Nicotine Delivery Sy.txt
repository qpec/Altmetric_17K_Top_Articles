Abstract
Introduction: This study evaluates the reasons for use and acceptance of Electronic Nicotine 
Delivery Systems (ENDS) among current and former cigarette smokers to assess if ENDS may 
become a satisfying alternative to cigarettes.
Methods: Data are from a national probability sample of 5717 US adults, surveyed June–November 
2014. The survey contained questions on awareness, usage, and reasons for use of traditional 
and novel tobacco products. 
The analytic sample was current and former smokers who ever used 
ENDS (n = 729) and was divided into four mutually exclusive categories. Among the 585 current 
smokers, 337 were no longer using ENDS (“E-Cig Rejecters”), and 248 were continuing to use 
both ENDS and cigarettes (“E-Cig Dual Users”). Among 144 former cigarette smokers, 101 were 
non-recent users of ENDS (“Quit All Products”), and 43 were continuing to use ENDS exclusively 
(“Switchers”).
Results: Former smokers (the “Switchers”) report finding ENDS a satisfying alternative to regular 
cigarettes, with only 15.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.4–27
.1) rating ENDS as less enjoyable 
than regular cigarettes. However, greater than fivefold more current smokers did not find them 
satisfying and stopped using them (77
.3%; 95% CI 72.1–82.4 of “E-Cig Rejecters” rated ENDS as 
less enjoyable). Being less harmful was the most highly rated reason for continuing to use ENDS 
among “Switchers.
” Most (80.9%) “Switchers” reported that ENDS helped them quit cigarettes.
Conclusion: Since many current smokers who have tried ENDS reject them as a satisfying alterna-
tive to regular cigarettes, ENDS will not replace regular cigarettes unless they improve.
Implications: Since about one-half of recent former smokers are trying ENDS with about one-
fourth continuing to use them, and many reporting that these products have helped them quit 
regular cigarettes, the potential impact of ENDS on population quit rates deserves continued sur-
veillance. However, since most current smokers who have tried ENDS reject them as a satisfying 
alternative to regular cigarettes, the potential of ENDS becoming a disruptive technology replac-
ing regular cigarettes remains uncertain. ENDS need to improve as a satisfying alternative or the 
attractiveness and appeal of the regular cigarette must be degraded to increase the potential of 
ENDS replacing regular cigarettes.

Introduction
Over the last 50 years, progress in tobacco control is estimated to 
have saved approximately 8 million Americans from premature 
death caused by smoking; however, over the same period, smok-
ing has caused the deaths of more than 20 million Americans.1,2 
Moreover, each year about an additional 500 000 Americans will die 
prematurely from a smoking-related illness.1 Recognizing that this 
persisting deadly toll is caused primarily by the highly engineered, 
addictive, and lethal cigarette, the public health community has 
been debating whether the emerging Electronic Nicotine Delivery 
Systems (ENDS) could become a disruptive technology that would 
compete with combusted tobacco products as satisfying and efficient 
alternative sources of nicotine and thus disrupt the entire tobacco 
product market.3–12 Unlike sustaining innovations which improve an 
existing product, disruptive innovations fundamentally differ from 
existing technologies, usually by being less complicated, more acces-
sible, and less expensive (eg, “…the Kodak moment when, with the 
rise of digital processes, photographic film manufacturers were left 
with an obsolete technology [p. 653]”).12–14 Thus, for the cigarette 
smoker who is unable or unwilling to discontinue using nicotine, an 
alternative product which provides “nicotine without the hazards 
associated with smoking (p. 654)” can be a disruptive innovation if it 
becomes widely adopted.12 While the efficiency of nicotine delivery is 
a key product characteristic in defining ENDS as a potential disrup-
tive innovation,3,5,12,15–20 research has shown that perceptions about 
the potential health benefits of ENDS are a primary predictor of use 
among cigarette smokers.21–27
Most of the evidence about ENDS users’ reasons for use and 
satisfaction have focused on differences between ever users and 
current users and were based on use of earlier or first-generation 
models of e-cigarettes (ie, from 2010 to 2013).21–25 However, ENDS 
products are evolving and improving beyond the initial “cig-alike” 
designs.15–20,28 Recently, Finney-Rutten and colleagues reported 
that the use of ENDS by current smokers in 2014 was motivated 
by potential health benefits and related to higher intentions to quit 
or reduce amount smoked.27 Another recent survey in the United 
States (May, 2014) by Rass and colleagues reported that among dual 
users of ENDS and tobacco cigarettes, the primary reasons for using 
ENDS were harm reduction and smoking cessation.26 However, nei-
ther these studies,26,27 nor other national surveys of ENDS use,29–31 
have evaluated if recent former smokers in the United States are find-
ing ENDS a satisfying alternative to the regular cigarette.
Preliminary findings from the nationally representative US 
National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) of 36 697 civilian adults 
aged 18 and over living in US households in 2014 reported that 
almost half of current smokers had ever used ENDS (ie, ever tried, 
even just one time), with 15.9% currently using ENDS (ie, at least 
once during the past 30 days), and 22% of recent former smokers 
(quit within the past year) currently using ENDS.32–34 Additionally, 
NHIS estimates of current smoking prevalence have shown recent 
declines.35 These declining smoking rates plus the high rates of ENDS 
use among recent former smokers are consistent with a potential 
emerging pattern of tobacco product market disruption. However, 
the NHIS does not include data on attitudes and reasons for use of 
ENDS needed to evaluate if the recent former smokers are finding 
ENDS a satisfying alternative to the regular cigarette.
Our 2014 Tobacco Products and Risk Perception Survey observed 
rates of ENDS similar to the 2014 NHIS reported rates; 51.1% of 
current smokers reported ever using ENDS, with 20.7% currently 
using ENDS, and 25.9% of recent former smokers (quit within the 
past year) using ENDS.34 Since the probability sample used in the 
Tobacco Products and Risk Perception Survey provides representa-
tive estimates of non-institutionalized US adults and includes more 
detailed data on use of ENDS, we examined attitudes and reasons 
for use of ENDS among four groups of recent former and current 
smokers to assess the potential that ENDS could become a disruptive 
technology that replaces combusted tobacco products in the United 
States.3,6,8,9,12
Methods
Procedure and Sample
This study used data from the 2014 Tobacco Products and Risk 
Perceptions Survey conducted June–November, 2014 by the Georgia 
State University (GSU) Tobacco Center of Regulatory Science 
(TCORS). This survey is an annual, cross-sectional survey of a 
probability sample drawn from Gfk’s KnowledgePanel, an online 
web panel designed to be representative of non-institutionalized 
US adults; the survey sample includes a representative oversample 
of pre-identified cigarette smokers selected with probabilities pro-
portional to size (PPS) after application of the panel demographic 
post-stratification weight. Overall, we invited 7991 KnowledgePanel 
members to participate in the survey: 7061 members for the gen-
eral population sample, of which 74.3% completed the screener 
survey and qualified for the main survey; and 930 members for the 
smoker augment sample, of which 697 completed the screener and 
599 (74.9%) qualified for the main survey by confirming their cur-
rent smoking status. Thus, from the 7991 KnowledgePanel members 
invited to participate in the survey, we obtained a sample of 5833 
qualified participants who completed the survey. After excluding 
116 cases for refusing to answer more than one-half of the survey 
questions, the final sample was 5717 cases, yielding a final stage 
completion rate of 74.4% and a qualification rate of 98.2%. The 
sample of interest for the present study consisted of 729 current and 
former smokers whom reported ever use of ENDS. This study was 
approved by the GSU Institutional Review Board.34 More details on 
the survey sample, weights, and missing data are provided in the 
Supplementary Material.
Measures
Cigarette Smoking Status
Smoking status was assessed using two items, “have you smoked at 
least 100 cigarettes in your lifetime” and “when was the last time 
you smoked a cigarette, even one or two puffs?” Respondents that 
reported not having smoked at least 100 cigarettes in their lives were 
classified as “never-smokers.” Of the remaining respondents, those 
who reported as having smoked at least 100 cigarettes and reported 
currently smoking cigarettes “every day” or “some days” were classi-
fied as “current smokers” and those who responded “not at all” were 
classified as “former smokers.” Former smokers who reported current 
use of any other combustible tobacco product (eg, little cigars or ciga-
rillos, large cigars, and/or hookah) were excluded from the analysis.
Use of ENDS
Awareness and use of ENDS were assessed by asking respondents 
if they had heard of the product before taking the survey and, if so, 
whether they had ever tried the product, even just one time. Prior to 
the questions assessing awareness and use of these products, respond-
ents were shown descriptions and images of ENDS. The description 
for ENDS used the descriptor “e-cigarette” to broadly include ENDS

products. Those respondents who indicated they had tried one or 
more of the products were asked whether they had used each of the 
products at least once during the past 30 days. Respondents report-
ing past 30-day use were considered current users.
Weaver et al.34 previously reported the patterns of use of ENDS 
and other traditional tobacco products in this 2014 online sample of 
5717 US adults. Among the overall weighted sample, 16.6% (95% 
confidence interval [CI]: 15.6–17.6, unweighted n = 1349) were cur-
rent cigarette smokers and 27.6% (95% CI: 26.3–28.8, unweighted 
n = 1554) were former cigarette smokers. Among the current smok-
ers, 51.1% (unweighted n = 585) reported ever use of ENDS, and 
20.7% (unweighted n = 248) reported use of ENDS in the past 
30 days. Among the former smokers, 13.1% (unweighted n = 164) 
reported ever use of ENDS, and 3.8% (unweighted n = 52) reported 
use of ENDS in the past 30 days. Twenty of these 164 former ciga-
rette smokers were excluded from the analysis due to missing data 
(n = 5) or due to current use of any combustible tobacco product (eg, 
little cigars or cigarillos, hookahs, or large cigars; n = 15), yielding 
a sample of 144, among whom 101 were non-recent users of ENDS 
and 43 were continuing to use ENDS exclusively.
ENDS and Smoker User-Groups
The selected sample (unweighted n = 729) of current and former 
smokers reporting ever use of ENDS were classified into four mutu-
ally exclusive groups based on their current use of ENDS: E-Cig 
Rejecters, E-Cig Dual Users, Quit All Products, and Switchers. 
Current cigarette smokers who had ever used ENDS but who were no 
longer using them were classified as E-Cig Rejecters (n = 337). E-Cig 
Dual Users (n = 248) were current cigarette smokers who were also 
currently using ENDS. “Quit All Products” (n = 101) were defined 
as former smokers who had tried ENDS but no longer using them 
or any combustible tobacco product. Switchers (n = 43) were former 
smokers who reported use of ENDS in the past 30 days but reported 
no current use of any other combustible tobacco product (eg, little 
cigars or cigarillos, hookahs, or large cigars). Supplementary Table S1 
provides a summary of these four mutually-exclusive groups.
Attitudes, Affect, and Reasons for Use of ENDS
Respondents were asked a series of questions about their attitudes 
toward ENDS, reasons for use, and perceptions of how ENDS com-
pared with smoking regular cigarettes. To measure affect toward 
ENDS, respondents were asked: “If you were to use an e-cigarette, 
would it make your feel…?” Similarly, they were asked: “How tense 
or relaxed would using an e-cigarette make you feel?” Current and 
former smokers who had ever used ENDS were asked: “How would 
you compare the experience of using e-cigarettes to smoking regular 
cigarettes?” (Responses included: “E-cigarettes are more enjoyable,” 
“About the same,” or “E-cigarettes are less enjoyable”).
To assess reasons for using ENDS, respondents were asked: “For 
each reason listed, please indicate how important it is to you in your 
use of e-cigarettes.”
Reasons were presented in random order:
1. I could use them in places where regular cigarette smoking isn’t 
allowed
2. E-cigarettes are less harmful to me than regular cigarettes
3. E-cigarettes are less harmful to those around me than regular 
cigarettes
4. E-cigarettes could help me quit smoking regular cigarettes
5. E-cigarettes could help me reduce the number of regular ciga-
rettes I smoke
6. Using an e-cigarette feels like smoking a regular cigarette
7. E-cigarettes are more acceptable than regular cigarettes
8. To satisfy my curiosity
9. They come in flavors I like
10. People who are important to me use e-cigarettes
ENDS and Quitting Regular Cigarettes
Former smokers who had ever tried ENDS were asked: “Did using 
e-cigarettes help you quit smoking regular cigarettes?” (Responses 
included: “Yes,” “No,” and “I don’t know”) and “How likely are 
you to go back to smoking regular cigarettes in the future, now that 
you’ve used e-cigarettes?” (Responses included: 1 = “Very unlikely” 
to 5 = “Very likely”). All respondents were also asked: “In your opin-
ion, are cigarette smokers who also use e-cigarettes more likely to 
quit smoking regular cigarettes, less likely to quit, or equally likely 
to quit smoking regular cigarettes.”
Respondent Characteristics
Demographic and other respondent characteristics data were 
obtained from profile surveys administered by GfK to all 
KnowledgePanel panelists. Respondent characteristics included self-
reported sex, age, race/ethnicity, educational attainment, annual 
household income, US Census region, perceived health status, sexual 
orientation, and presence of a child (under 18 years) in the home.
Statistical Analysis
We used SAS 9.4 to obtain design-based (weighted) point estimates 
and 95% CIs. Bivariate associations among variables were tested 
using Rao-Scott χ2 tests,36 and between group differences were tested 
using multinomial logistic regression, or weighted F or t-tests. Prior 
to conducting these analyses, we assessed the extent and ignorability 
of missing data for “ever use” and past 30-day use questions for 
the tobacco products. On the bases of these checks, respondents 
with missing data were excluded from further analyses under the 
data supported assumption that missingness is ignorable and com-
pletely at random (See Weaver et al.34 Supplementary Material for an 
expanded summary of the missing data.).
Results
Table 1 reports the population demographics of the selected sam-
ple (n = 729) of current and former smokers reporting ever use of 
ENDS and the four mutually exclusive groups based on their current 
use of ENDS: E-Cig Rejecters, E-Cig Dual Users, Quit All Products, 
and Switchers. In multinomial logistic regression analyses, the four 
groups were similar in sociodemographic distributions for sex, age, 
race/ethnicity, household income, perceived health status, sexual ori-
entation, and presence of children under 18 in the home, although 
E-Cig Rejecters and E-Cig Dual Users were less likely than Switchers 
to have a college degree (P = .002 and P = .044, respectively). E-Cig 
Rejecters also were less likely than Switchers to live in the West 
region of the United States (P = .0235). Weighted frequencies by 
population demographics are provided in Supplementary Table S2.
Figure 1 displays the mean rating of importance for each of the 
10 reasons for using ENDS across the four groups. Details on statis-
tical testing of these ratings across the four groups are provided in 
Supplementary Table S3. Switchers rated ENDS 
“were less harmful to 
me than regular cigarettes” and “could help me quit smoking regular 
cigarettes” as highly important reasons for using ENDS, with ratings 
significantly higher than the E-Cig Rejecters and the Quit All products

groups (P < .05). Rating that “ENDS were less harmful for others 
around me than regular cigarettes,” and that the ENDS could help 
users reduce cigarette consumption also were significantly more 
important reasons among the Switchers than the Quit All Products 
(P < .05). Similarly, ratings for the reason that ENDS “are more 
acceptable than regular cigarettes” were significantly higher among 
the Switchers than the Quit All Products (P < .05). Ratings on the 
importance of the reason “To satisfy my curiosity” overall were 
somewhat lower and did not differ between the four groups. The rat-
ings between groups were significantly different for “They come in 
flavors I like” (P < .0001) with this reason being rated higher among 
Switchers than the Quit All Products (P = .003). This is consistent 
with 74% (95% CI: 60.4–88.4) of Switchers indicating that they 
had ever used ENDS with flavors other than tobacco flavors versus 
50.6% (95% CI: 43.3–58.0) of E-Cig Dual Users, 35.2% (95% CI: 
29.4–41.1) of E-Cig Rejecters, and 34.7% (95% CI: 24.9–44.4) of, 
Quit All Products (Rao-Scott χ2 = 28.7, P < .0001).
As displayed in Figure 2, the four groups varied significantly 
when asked to imagine how they would feel using an ENDS, from 
very bad to very good (Rao-Scott χ2 = 107.06, P < .0001) and from 
very tense to very relaxed (Rao-Scott χ2 = 53.4, P < .0001). Among 
Switchers, 66.8% (95% CI: 50.6–82.9) felt good or very good, 
and 68.7% (95% CI: 52.8–84.6) felt somewhat or very relaxed. 
Similarly, 50.6% (95% CI: 43.0–58.1) of E-Cig Dual Users felt good 
or very good, and 60.0% (95% CI: 52.6–67.4) felt somewhat or very 
relaxed. In comparison, only 27.4% (95% CI: 21.4–33.4) of E-Cig 
Rejecters and 18.9% (95% CI: 10.2–27.5) of Quit All Products 
imagined that they would feel somewhat or very good, and 38.4% 
(95% CI: 31.7–45.1) and 39.9% (95% CI: 28.6–51.1), respectively, 
imagined that they would feel somewhat or very relaxed using an 
ENDS.
Figure 3 displays the differences in opinions about “How would 
you compare the experience of using E-cigarettes to smoking regu-
lar cigarettes” among the four groups (Rao-Scott χ2 = 111.79, P < 
.0001). Few E-Cig Rejecters, E-Cig Dual Users, and Quit All Products 
(2.2%, 95% CI: 0.5–3.9; 14.4%, 95% CI: 9.3–19.6; and 19.0%, 
95% CI: 10.4–27.7, respectively) reported that ENDS were more 
enjoyable than regular cigarettes; and 77.3% (95% CI: 72.1–82.4), 
52.0% (95% CI: 44.6–59.3), 43.1% (95% CI: 32.9–53.4), respec-
tively, stated that ENDS were less enjoyable. Almost all Switchers 
reported that ENDS were either more (51.6%, 95% CI: 35.3–67.9) 
or about as enjoyable (32.7%, 95% CI: 17.7–47.6), and only 15.8%

(95% CI: 4.4–27.1) rated ENDS as less enjoyable than smoking 
regular cigarettes.
The selected sample of current and former smokers reporting 
ever use of ENDS was representative of an estimated 22 472 712 
(95% CI: 21 563 133 to 23 382 291) US adults (aged 18+) in 2014. 
Among this subpopulation of current and former smokers report-
ing ever use of ENDS, an estimated 9 443 788 (42.0%, 95% CI: 
38.0–46.1) were current smokers who were not current ENDS users 
(E-Cig Rejecters); 6 766 362 (30.0%, 95% CI: 26.4–33.8) were both 
current smokers and current ENDS users (E-Cig Dual Users); 4 474 
978 (19.9%, 95% CI: 16.3–23.5) were former smokers and former 
ENDS users (Quit All Products); and 1 787 584 (8.0%, 95% CI: 
5.5–10.4) were former smokers who were also current ENDS users 
(Switchers).
Overall, 87.8% (95% CI: 85.0–90.6) endorsed the opinion that 
cigarette smokers who also use ENDS are equally or more likely 
to quit smoking regular cigarettes. Among the Switchers, 80.9% 
(95% CI: 68.3–93.6, weighted n = 1 396 753) reported that using 
ENDS helped them quit smoking regular cigarettes, whereas only 
25.4% (95% CI: 16.0–34.8, weighted n = 1 037 727) of the Quit All 
Products reported this. Among these approximately 1 million Quit 
All Products former smokers, an estimated 460 000 quit smoking 
regular cigarettes within the past year (Supplementary Table S5 pro-
vides more detailed data on self-reported time since smoking last 
cigarette among Quit All Product and Switchers groups). Among the 
approximately 1.4 million Switchers who reported that using ENDS 
helped them quit smoking regular cigarettes, an estimated about 920 
000 quit within the past year. Although this cross-sectional survey 
did not have extensive questions on their smoking cessation process, 
these data suggest that about 2.4 million former smokers perceived 
that the use of ENDS may have helped in quitting use of regular 
cigarettes, with about 1.4 (460K + 920K) million having quit in the 
past year. No former smokers who had used ENDS but then had 
quit all nicotine products (Quit All Products) rated the likelihood of 
going back to smoking regular cigarettes as somewhat or very likely. 
Among the Switchers, 2.0% (95 CI: 0.0–6.1) rated relapse back to 
regular smoking as very likely, and 5.2% (95% CI: 0.0–12.4) rated 
it as somewhat likely.
Supplementary Table S4 provides more detailed data on which 
ENDS device types were used most often by the sample. A high 
proportion of E-Cig Rejecters and Quit All Products groups reported 
primarily using “electronic cigarettes” (89.5%, 95% CI: 85.5–93.6; 
87.0%, 95% CI: 79.7–94.2; respectively), whereas E-Cig Dual Users 
and Switchers were less likely to report primarily using “electronic 
cigarettes,” and reported greater use of a “tank system containing 
e-liquid” (11.8%, 95% CI: 6.7–17.0 and 35.3%, 95% CI: 19.6–
51.0, respectively). Among E-Cig Dual Users “vape pens” (9.9%, 
95% CI: 5.5–14.3) were also reported.
Discussion
ENDS need to improve as a satisfying alternative or the attractive-
ness and appeal of the regular cigarette must be degraded to increase 
the potential of ENDS developing into a disruptive technology that 
most smokers may adopt in place of the cigarette.3,5–7,9 About one-
fourth of recent former smokers (the Switchers) reported finding 
ENDS a satisfying alternative to regular cigarettes (almost 85% rat-
ing ENDS as equally or more enjoyable than cigarettes). However, 
more than fivefold more current smokers (1 787 584 ÷ 9 443 788 = 
5.28) did not find them satisfying and stopped using them (“E-Cig 
Rejecters”). Consistent with other recent research,26,27 we found that 
6.8 million “E-Cig Dual Users” had more mixed perceptions about 
how satisfying ENDS were and continued to smoke regular ciga-
rettes along with using ENDS.
These varying patterns of acceptance and rejection of ENDS 
as a satisfying alternative to regular cigarettes provide some 
insights into factors about ENDS that will be most important in 
evaluating their potential to develop into truly disruptive innova-
tions beyond efficiency in nicotine delivery (ie, documented health 
benefits, public acceptability, and flavors).3,5–7,10,12,22–27,37 Evidence 
from the United Kingdom have emphasized the need for “clear 
information on the relative harm of cigarettes and e-cigarettes” 
especially among smokers trying to quit who are seeking a less 
harmful source of nicotine.4,17,38–42 The comparative costs of 
ENDS versus regular cigarettes also could be very important in 
wider adoption of ENDS as an alternative.27,43,44 Additionally, the 
E-Cig Dual Users and Switchers were more likely to use ENDS 
products other than the basic E-cigarette, suggesting that con-
tinuing product innovation could increase users’ satisfaction 
(Supplementary Table S4).

To encourage a potentially positive pattern of ENDS replacing 
cigarettes, it can be argued that efforts are needed from the pub-
lic health community to reduce the appeal and attractiveness of the 
cigarette and other combusted tobacco products; namely, decreas-
ing the product, promotion, placement, and price advantage of these 
more lethal combusted tobacco products.1,45 The passage of the 2009 
Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (Tobacco 
Control Act) provides the FDA with authority to regulate cigarettes 
and smokeless tobacco, including the authority to adopt product 
standards, such as reducing nicotine levels1,37,46–48 or requiring the 
smoke to have a higher pH46; and graphic warning labels to reduce 
the “promotional” appeal.1,49–51 Educational campaigns1,52,53 and 
sales restrictions using “time-place-manner” local authority,1,54–56 
plain packaging,57 raising the minimum age of legal access to 2158,59 
and raising the average retail “price” of combusted tobacco products 
have also been recommended.1,43,44,60
A range of potential regulatory options for ENDS have been 
 
reviewed10,17,42,55,61–67; however, ENDS include a wide variety of elec-
tronic cigarettes (disposable and rechargeable) and tank-style sys-
tems that can be modified, thus forming a very heterogeneous group 
of products4,5,15 that make the evaluation of safety and potential 
harm and benefit difficult to evaluate.5,10,17,61,68 Although the 2009 
Tobacco Control Act did not originally cover ENDS69; once the pro-
posed deeming rule is finalized, the FDA may have the authority 
to regulate ENDS, creating premarket approval requirements and 
product standards appropriate for the protection of public health. 
How the population health standard in the 2009 Tobacco Control 
Act will be implemented in regulating ENDS as a disruptive technol-
ogy has been widely debated.3–5,8–10,42,61,63,70–72 A positive impact on 
adult cessation rates would be important,73,74 but the overall impact 
on population health would also consider the impact of ENDS on 
initiation among youth and young adult never smokers.62,73,75,76 Our 
2014 data estimate that about 2.4 million US adults were helped 
in quitting regular cigarettes by using ENDS, with 1.4 million of 
these former smokers quitting in 2014. However, we cannot assess 
how many of these former smokers would have quit without using 
e-cigarettes nor how many “dual users” may have been delayed 
from quitting cigarettes. Hence, the impact (if any) of these 2.4 mil-
lion former smokers on national quit rates cannot be determined 
by this study.
Limitations
This study has multiple limitations. First, the use of the internet 
panel may raise concerns about sample representativeness, especially 
if the panel has been used in prior tobacco research. Mitigating this 
concern, however, is internal research by GfK that suggests minimal 
panel conditioning from participation in prior tobacco research.77 
Second, the data are based upon self-report, and biochemical veri-
fication of cigarette smoking and use of other products could not 
be conducted. While the validity of self-reported cigarette smoking 
has been confirmed,1,78 the accuracy of self-report of other products, 
particularly novel products, has not been evaluated and remains 
uncertain. Third, the rapidly changing nature of ENDS makes accu-
rate questionnaire descriptions and terminology difficult to define. 
Fourth, the 2014 Tobacco Products and Risk Perception Survey had 
limited assessments of smoking cessation behaviors among ENDS 
users. Fifth, the cross-sectional design of this study makes it very 
difficult to assess the actual impact on population quit rates of these 
self-reports of using ENDS to quit or how much dual use may be 
delaying smoking cessation.
Conclusion
The potential of ENDS to have positive impacts on population health 
remains uncertain.1,41,42,61,62,73–75,79,80 Since about one-half of recent 
former smokers are trying ENDS with about one-fourth continuing 
to use them, and many report that these products have helped them 
quit regular cigarettes, the potential impact of ENDS on popula-
tion quit rates deserves continued surveillance. However, since most 
current smokers who have tried ENDS reject them as a satisfying 
alternative to regular cigarettes, the potential of ENDS becoming 
a disruptive technology replacing regular cigarettes remains uncer-
tain. If the level of acceptance of ENDS among some recent former 
smokers (almost 85% of the Switchers rating ENDS as equally or 
more enjoyable than cigarettes) could be achieved among all current 
smokers who are trying ENDS, the potential of ENDS becoming a 
disruptive technology replacing regular cigarettes would dramati-
cally increase. This outcome could become more likely if the ENDS 
products continue to improve or the attractiveness and appeal of 
regular cigarettes is degraded.
