Background: Increasing numbers of older patients are undergoing vascular surgery. 
Inadequate preoperative assessment and optimization may contribute to increased 
postoperative morbidity and mortality.  
Methods: Patients aged at least 65 years scheduled for elective aortic aneurysm repair or 
lower-limb arterial surgery were enrolled in an RCT of standard preoperative assessment 
or preoperative comprehensive geriatric assessment and optimization. Randomization was 
stratified by sex and surgical site (aorta/lower limb). Primary outcome was length of 
hospital stay. Secondary outcome measures included new medical co-morbidities, 
postoperative medical or surgical complications, discharge to a higher level of dependency 
and 30-day readmission rate.  
 Results: A total of 176 patients were included in the final analysis (control 91, 
intervention 85). Geometric mean length of stay was 5.53 days in the control group and 
3.32 days in the intervention group (ratio of geometric means 0.60, 95 per cent c.i. 0.46 to 
0.79; P < 0.001). There was a lower incidence of delirium (11 versus 24 per cent; P = 
0.018), cardiac complications (8 versus 27 per cent; P = 0.001) and bladder/bowel 
complications (33 versus 55 per cent; P = 0.003) in the intervention group compared with 
the control group. Patients in the intervention group were less likely to require discharge to 
a higher level of dependency (4 of 85 versus 12 of 91; P = 0.051).  
Conclusion: In this study of patients aged 65 years or older undergoing vascular surgery, 
preoperative comprehensive geriatric assessment was associated with a shorter length of 
hospital stay. Patients undergoing assessment and optimization had a lower incidence of 
complications and were less likely to be discharged to a higher level of dependency. 
Registration number: ISRCTN23142588 (http://www.controlled-trials.com). 
+A: Introduction 
As the population ages the number of older people undergoing surgical procedures is 
increasing1. Despite improved mortality and symptomatic benefits of surgery for older 
people2–4, there continues to be an excess of adverse postoperative outcomes in older 
patients5–9. This is likely to be explained by a combination of physiological changes, the 
cumulative effect of multiple morbidities and the presence of geriatric syndromes. 
Observational work within the older vascular surgical population has identified a significant 
burden of undiagnosed cognitive impairment, high incidence of delirium, considerable frailty 
and impaired functional status10,11. Vascular risk factors such as smoking, hypertension and 
hypercholesterolaemia, which are common in patients undergoing vascular surgery, are also 
independent risk factors for cognitive impairment, postoperative delirium and frailty12–15. 
Furthermore, vascular risk factors increase postoperative morbidity. Such postoperative 
complications can all contribute to increased mortality, poorer patient experience, prolonged 
hospital stay and greater financial costs16,17.  
 Evidence is emerging to suggest that systematic structured preoperative assessment 
and clinical optimization of older surgical patients may improve postoperative outcomes18,19. 
Comprehensive geriatric assessment is an established and evidence-based method of 
evaluating and optimizing physical, psychological, functional and social issues in older 
patients20,21. The initial assessment prompts the development of an individualized care plan 
that includes investigation, treatment, rehabilitation support and long-term follow-up. For 
example, a patient may receive medical optimization of heart failure, assessment and 
management of newly identified cognitive impairment, and provision of mobility aids or 
referral to therapy-based exercise programmes. The use of comprehensive geriatric 
assessment in medical inpatients and community-dwelling older people has been shown to 
improve mortality at 36-month follow-up, increase the chance of living independently at 
home, and also to confer a positive effect on physical and cognitive function20. A recent 
Cochrane review and meta-analysis21 of 22 trials showed that patients who underwent 
comprehensive geriatric assessment in acute geriatric wards were more likely to be alive and 
in their own homes at 12 months than patients receiving general medical care. Furthermore, 
fewer patients were institutionalized at hospital discharge and cognitive decline was less 
pronounced in the group that received comprehensive geriatric assessment.   
Despite the evidence supporting the use of comprehensive geriatric assessment in the 
medical setting, this process remains relatively understudied in the surgical population. Where 
comprehensive geriatric assessment differs from other preoperative risk assessment tools is in 
the individualized multidomain optimization that is prompted by the assessment process. It is 
this optimization that will potentially modify perioperative risk and improve postoperative 
outcomes. A systematic review and narrative synthesis19 concluded that preoperative 
comprehensive geriatric assessment is likely to have a positive impact on postoperative 
outcomes in older patients undergoing elective surgery, but recommended further research to 
investigate the optimal approaches and its effectiveness in this setting. 
+A: Methods 
 A single-centre RCT was performed within an inner city teaching hospital with a tertiary 
referral practice for vascular arterial surgery (ISRCTN23142588, UKCRN 13260). Eligible 
and consenting patients were randomized to receive either comprehensive geriatric 
assessment and optimization, or usual care. Ethics approval was given by South East London 
Research Ethics Committee (12/LO/0655). Eligibility criteria were patients aged at least 65 
years scheduled for elective endovascular/open aortic aneurysm repair or lower-limb arterial 
bypass surgery.   Patients were not eligible if they were admitted directly to the ward from the 
surgical clinic or emergency department for emergency or very urgent surgery, which 
precluded the opportunity for outpatient preoperative assessment and optimization.  
Patients and carers were involved in the design of this study including the initial 
development of the research question. Participants from an observational study that preceded 
this trial advised on recruitment, randomization and follow-up. This involved discussion 
about the burden of the intervention, which was felt to be minimal by the patients consulted.  
All study participants will be offered a written summary of the study results. 
+B: Recruitment, consent and randomization 
Patients were approached by a research nurse or fellow in the vascular surgery outpatient 
clinic once listed for surgery. Those satisfying the inclusion criteria were assessed for 
capacity to consent to study participation. Patients lacking capacity to consent were recruited 
under sections 30–34 of the Mental Capacity Act22. Written consent was obtained (either from 
patients or consultees). Patients were approached, assessed for eligibility and consented at the 
first meeting after they had read the patient information sheet.  
Randomization was internet-based and was carried out independently by the King’s 
Clinical Trials Unit (www.ctu.co.uk) using a 1 : 1 allocation, and was stratified according to 
sex and site of surgical procedure (aorta, lower limb). According to randomized group 
allocation, participants were given appointments to attend either a standard preassessment 
clinic (routine care within the hospital) or to the study intervention, a comprehensive geriatric 
assessment and optimization clinic. 
+B: Clinical care 
 +C: Intervention group 
Patients in the intervention group received comprehensive geriatric assessment and 
optimization in an outpatient clinic setting. A geographically separate clinic on a different 
hospital site with entirely different clinic staff was used to minimize contamination bias 
between the two groups in the single centre. Patients were assessed and optimized according 
to peer-reviewed protocols based on current evidence, national and hospital guidelines, and 
expert opinion (examples can be found in Figs S1–S3 and Tables S1 and S2, supporting 
information). The comprehensive geriatric assessment was delivered by a multidisciplinary 
team (geriatrician, clinical nurse specialist, social worker, occupational therapist) according to 
individual patient need. The intervention was documented in an individualized care plan 
available to all healthcare professionals on the electronic patient record. This care plan 
provided advice regarding the prevention and management of anticipated postoperative 
complications, but did not refer to the patient’s involvement in the study.  
+C: Control group 
The control group received standard preoperative care. Within the participating centre this 
consisted of a nurse-led preoperative assessment clinic where a protocolized appraisal of 
anaesthetic and medical issues was conducted. This process tended to focus on the binary 
labelling of ‘fit’ or ‘unfit’ for anaesthesia/surgery, and was not designed to optimize patients’ 
fitness. If issues that may affect surgery were identified, a more detailed specialist medical or 
anaesthetic evaluation was requested, or patients were referred back to their general 
practitioner.  
+C: Postoperative care 
In both groups, postoperative care was delivered by surgical teams who were unaware of the 
patient’s involvement in the study. This routine care involved junior surgical staff and clinical 
nurse specialists utilizing all electronic clinical documents (including the individualized care 
plans generated following comprehensive geriatric assessment in the intervention group).   
+B: Outcome measures 
 The primary outcome measure was duration of hospital stay; this was recorded routinely by 
hospital administrative staff who were unaware of the study, and extracted from hospital 
electronic patient record by an unblinded research nurse.  Use of length of stay as the primary 
outcome measure was based on a priori consultation with patients and carers, as it was 
considered to encapsulate both the overall ‘success’ of the hospital stay and the patient 
experience. It is also a major determinant of hospital costs per episode of care. 
Secondary outcome measures were: new co-morbid diagnoses made, such as 
cognitive impairment (yes/no), postoperative medical and surgical complications, including 
delirium (yes/no), discharge to a higher level of care dependency (new care package or 
reablement at discharge, discharge to rehabilitation facility or other hospital, and new care 
home placement) and readmission to hospital within 30 days. These were recorded by an 
unblinded research nurse using predefined criteria for the presence or absence of 
complications according to the clinical record, medication record and results of investigations. 
The data were taken from the clinical records made by usual care teams that were unaware of 
the study.  
To explore potential clinical explanations for any difference observed in length of 
stay, all new diagnoses, investigations, discussions, referrals and medication changes made at 
preoperative assessments were recorded as secondary outcomes.  
+B: Statistical analysis 
Mean(s.d.) length of hospital stay in the control group was expected to be 6.5(4.0) days, based 
on previous routine activity data in this surgical unit. A reduction of 25 per cent (1.6 days) 
was judged to be clinically and financially important. Assuming 80 per cent power and a two-
sided significance level of 5 per cent, a total sample size of 198 patients was required (99 per 
group). Attrition rates were expected to be negligible from previous observational work that 
showed no drop-outs10; the target sample size was inflated (by 5 per cent) to 208. 
Baseline data are presented as mean(s.d.) (continuous data), or frequencies and 
percentages (categorical data). The primary analysis was by intention to treat. The primary 
outcome, length of hospital stay, was positively skewed and so was log-transformed for 
 analysis, and then back-transformed to give the ratio of geometric means with a 95 per cent 
confidence interval. This provided an estimate of the relative change in length of stay in the 
intervention group compared with the control group. The difference in outcome between the 
two randomized groups was analysed using multiple regression that included the stratification 
factors sex and surgical site as co-variables. Where there was observed imbalance in baseline 
variables, a sensitivity analysis was performed to adjust the primary outcome analysis for 
these factors and test the robustness of the findings.  
Binary outcomes were compared by allocated group using the 2 test (or Fisher’s 
exact test where the frequencies were small). Wherever possible, all differences between the 
trial arms are given with 95 per cent confidence intervals, calculated using Wilson’s method 
in Confidence Interval Analysis (CIA) software (www.som.soton.ac.uk/cia/). It was not 
possible to adjust for the stratification factors using logistic regression for the majority of 
secondary outcomes owing to small numbers of events.  
The analysis was conducted unblinded by a biostatistician who had contributed to the 
protocol and plan of analysis, but was not part of the clinical trial team.  
+A: Results 
A total of 209 patients were recruited between November 2012 and February 2014, of whom 
105 were assigned randomly to the control arm and 104 to the intervention arm (Fig. 1). No 
patient withdrew consent to participate in the study and none were lost to follow-up. The 
primary outcome (length of hospital stay in days) was available for 176 patients (91 control, 
85 intervention) but not for 33 patients (14 control, 19 intervention) ((Fig. 1).  
+B: Baseline characteristics  
There were some differences between the randomized groups in terms of baseline 
characteristics (Table 1).  
+B: Primary outcome 
Mean length of stay in the intervention group was reduced by 40 per cent compared with that 
in the control group (ratio of geometric means 0.60, 95 per cent c.i. 0.46 to 0.79; P < 0.001). 
This reduction equated to a mean reduction of just over 2 days (Table 2). The difference was 
 virtually unchanged after adjusting for the observed baseline imbalance in history of 
cerebrovascular disease, falls and smoking (ratio of geometric means 0.62, 0.46 to 0.83; P = 
0.002). 
+B: Secondary outcomes 
There were significantly lower proportions of patients with postoperative delirium, cardiac 
complications and bladder/bowel issues, with a trend towards fewer infective episodes and 
fewer units of blood transfused in the intervention compared with the control group (Table 2).  
Sensitivity analyses for the proportions with delirium were conducted to adjust for 
differences in potential confounders between the two groups (history of cerebrovascular 
disease, falls and smoking), but these did not affect the size of difference observed.  
Furthermore, patients in the intervention group were less likely to have care or rehabilitation 
needs necessitating a change in discharge destination or new provision of rehabilitation and/or 
care; this was close to statistical significance (P = 0.051) (Fig. 2).  
+B: Assessment and optimization according to comprehensive geriatric assessment 
Comprehensive geriatric assessment recognized previously undiagnosed issues across 
multiple domains. Cognitive disorders, delirium risk, frailty and medical morbidity were 
identified more frequently in the intervention group than the control group (Table 3). In 
accordance with the objectives of comprehensive geriatric assessment, the recognition of 
these issues prompted both preoperative management (such as medication changes), longer-
term follow-up (for example by primary care), and proactive discussion with patients and 
families (for example about cognitive issues) (Table 4).  
+A: Discussion 
In this RCT, preoperative comprehensive geriatric assessment was associated with a shorter 
hospital stay for older patients undergoing elective vascular surgery, without an increase in 
30-day readmission rate. The observed reduction in length of stay in those receiving 
comprehensive geriatric assessment probably resulted from fewer postoperative medical 
complications, anticipation and modification of potential functional and discharge issues, and 
streamlining of the patient pathway. 
 This finding is in keeping with existing literature on comprehensive geriatric 
assessment in other settings20,21 where the multidomain assessment and optimization of older 
patients is thought to improve both physical and cognitive function. In the present study, the 
recognition of previously undiagnosed pathology facilitated optimization through both 
medical management (higher rates of medication changes made in intervention group) and 
multidisciplinary intervention (higher rates of preoperative therapy and social work referrals). 
This prompted standardized management of anticipated postoperative complications through 
clear communication with ward teams and other health professionals. Furthermore, 
communication with patients and their families was more commonly undertaken in the 
intervention arm, allowing anticipation of information regarding risk of postoperative 
complications such as delirium, expected length of stay and expectations around discharge 
planning. This fuller preoperative assessment and optimization of medical morbidity, 
anticipation and mitigation of potential social issues at discharge, and advice on standardized 
management of postoperative complications is postulated to be responsible for the observed 
reduction in length of stay.   
The number of patients who did not undergo surgery was larger in the intervention 
arm than the control arm. The comprehensive assessment undertaken in the intervention 
group was shown to significantly increase the number of new diagnoses made. These 
included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease (stage 3 or worse) 
and cognitive impairment, with a trend towards larger numbers of new diagnoses of 
ischaemic heart disease and cardiac failure. It is possible that this fuller assessment of 
perioperative risk resulted in the greater number of decisions to manage patients 
conservatively in the intervention group. Although the effect of the comprehensive 
intervention on patient selection may have influenced length of stay, the numbers are such 
that this would not account for the marked change observed.  The impact of comprehensive 
geriatric assessment on patient selection for surgery in this study has important implications 
for clinical practice.  
 
 There are limitations to the study. The primary outcome measure was documented in 
the electronic patient record by hospital administrative staff who were unaware of the study. 
The length of stay was then recorded by an unblinded research nurse, but the objective 
method of collecting the measure eliminated the risk of bias. Secondary outcomes were 
recorded by the research nurse using predefined criteria for the presence or absence of 
complications according to the clinical record, medication records and results of 
investigations. These data were taken from the clinical records made by usual care teams, 
including a succession of junior medical staff on rotation who were unaware of the patient’s 
enrolment in the study, making it unlikely that there was a systematic tendency for any 
difference in their record keeping. The predefined criteria for the secondary outcomes 
provided minimal scope for interpretation of their presence or absence by the research nurse.  
Randomization ensured a similar distribution of baseline characteristics between the 
two groups; however, there was a higher rate of previous stroke in the control group, and 
higher reported rates of previous falls and current smoking in the intervention group. It is 
possible that these differences could be explained by a fuller assessment in the intervention 
group, where events reported by patients as strokes were discounted after assessment and 
more accurate details on falls and smoking were obtained.  Whether or not these findings 
were true differences or reporting differences, adjustment using sensitivity analysis showed 
no impact on the observed difference in length of stay between the two groups. 
There is potential contamination between the groups as the study was conducted 
within a single surgical service in one hospital Trust. Steps undertaken to minimize this bias 
included use of clinics in different geographical locations employing different staff for 
preoperative care in each trial arm, ensuring that staff from one clinic could not directly 
observe actions taken in the other clinic. Any contamination that did occurred would have 
been expected to reduce differences in outcomes.  
 
The results of this study have potential significance for other centres offering 
elective vascular surgery to older patients. Although patients in the present study were 
undergoing vascular surgery, the findings build on literature examining similar multiple-
 component interventions in other older surgical populations, such as those following hip 
fracture23 or undergoing elective orthopaedic surgery24. Such significant findings suggest that 
the application of preoperative comprehensive geriatric assessment may be relevant to older 
patients undergoing elective and emergency surgery across other surgical subspecialties, 
including cancer surgery.  
 
Future work in this area could include economic evaluation of the intervention, 
better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the observed improvement in length of 
stay and larger-scale evaluation of the intervention. The translation of study findings into 
routine clinical practice should be further explored using implementation science.
