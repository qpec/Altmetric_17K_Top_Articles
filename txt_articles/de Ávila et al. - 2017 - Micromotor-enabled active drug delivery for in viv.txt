Advances in bioinspired design principles and nanomaterials have led to tremendous
progress in autonomously moving synthetic nano/micromotors with diverse functionalities in
different environments. However, a significant gap remains in moving nano/micromotors
from test tubes to living organisms for treating diseases with high efficacy. Here we present
the first, to our knowledge, in vivo therapeutic micromotors application for active drug
delivery to treat gastric bacterial infection in a mouse model using clarithromycin as a model
antibiotic and Helicobacter pylori infection as a model disease. The propulsion of drug-loaded
magnesium micromotors in gastric media enables effective antibiotic delivery, leading to
significant bacteria burden reduction in the mouse stomach compared with passive drug
carriers, with no apparent toxicity. Moreover, while the drug-loaded micromotors reach
similar therapeutic efficacy as the positive control of free drug plus proton pump inhibitor, the
micromotors can function without proton pump inhibitors because of their built-in proton
depletion function associated with their locomotion.

ecent advances in the nano and micromotor field1–4 in
terms of improvement of biocompatibility and biological
function have led to their growing use in biomedicine5–7,
including therapeutic payload delivery8–13, micro-surgery14, 15,
isolation of biological targets16, operation within living cells17, 18,
and removal of toxicant molecules and organisms19–21. Although
significant progress has been accomplished to demonstrate
the in vitro capabilities of nano/micromotors to transport
therapeutic cargos to target destinations, tremendous effort is still
required to translate the proof-of-concept research to in vivo
biomedical applications.
In
recent
years,
the
utility
and
performance
of
these
motor-based active transport systems have been tested in live
animals. For example, our group has demonstrated the attractive
in vivo performance of zinc-based and magnesium (Mg)-based
micromotors under in vivo conditions22–24. These studies have
shown that artificial micromotors can self-propel in the stomach,
and intestinal fluids for enhanced retention in the gastric mucous
layer22 and targeted delivery in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract23.
Walker et al.25 presented the ability of magnetic micropropellers
to move through gastric mucin gels, by mimicking the mucus
penetration strategy of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori). In addition,
Nelson’s group has demonstrated that magnetically actuated
microswimmers can swarm in vivo11, whereas Martel’s group
has shown that microorganisms can be transformed into
natural robots under magnetic guidance towards therapeutic
cargo delivery into deep tumor regions12. These prior in vivo
studies
of
synthetic
motors
have
significantly
advanced
motor research and cleared a path towards direct evaluation
of
disease-oriented
therapeutic
efficacy
associated
with
motor-enabled active drug delivery. However, this still remains an
alluring but unmet goal for biomedical researchers.
This work demonstrates, to the best of our knowledge, the
first attempt to apply Mg-based micromotors, loaded with
antibiotic drug clarithromycin (CLR), for in vivo treatment of
H. pylori infection in a mouse model. Given the built-in proton
depletion function, this motor-based therapy is able to undergo
the harsh gastric environment to achieve antibacterial efficacy

 without involving the commonly used proton pump inhibitors
(PPIs). The H. pylori bacteria, found in about half of the world’s
population, can cause stomach infection and subsequently lead to
diverse gastric and extragastric diseases26, 27. In most cases, the
administration of antibiotics for the treatment of H. pylori
infection is combined with the use of PPIs to reduce the
production of gastric acid28, because the gastric acid could make
antibiotics less effective. The effectiveness of PPIs is attributed to
the irreversible binding to proton pumps and thus to suppress
acid secretion29,
30, which in long term use can lead to
adverse effects such as headache and diarrhea and in more serious
scenarios cause anxiety or depression31–34. Therefore, it would
be highly beneficial to develop an alternative therapeutic
regimen with equivalent or advantageous therapeutic efficacy as
the current antibiotic treatments while excluding the use of PPIs.
The reported Mg-based micromotors rely on the combination
of a CLR-loaded poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) layer and a
chitosan polymer layer covering on a propellant Mg core to offer
high drug-loading capacity, along with biodegradability. The
positively charged chitosan outer coating enables adhesion of the
motor onto the stomach wall35, facilitating efficient localized
autonomous release of CLR from the PLGA polymer coating.
In contrast to acid suppression by PPIs, Mg-based micromotors
can temporally and physically alter the local acidic environment
by quickly depleting protons while propelling within the
stomach24. By using acid as fuel, these synthetic motors rapidly
deplete protons while propelling within the stomach, which can
effectively elevate the gastric pH to neutral in < 20 min after the
motors are applied24. Testing in a mouse model has demonstrated
that these motors can safely and rapidly neutralize gastric acid
without causing noticeable acute toxicity or affecting the stomach
function, and that the normal stomach pH can be restored
within 24 h post motor administration. Such elimination of
the PPI administration is coupled with significant reduction of
bacteria burden, as demonstrated in vivo in a mouse model.
Using a mouse model of H. pylori infection, the propulsion of
the drug-loaded Mg-based micromotors in gastric fluid along
with their outer chitosan layer are shown to greatly enhance
the binding and retention of the drug-loaded motors on the
stomach wall. As these micromotors are propelled in the gastric
fluid, their Mg cores are dissolved, leading to self-destruction of
these motors without harmful residues, as is demonstrated by the
toxicity studies.
Overall, we take advantage of the efficient propulsion of
Mg-based micromotors in the acidic stomach environment, their
built-in proton depletion ability, their active and prolonged
retention within the stomach wall, and their high drug-loading
capacity, to demonstrate to the best of our knowledge the first
actual in vivo therapeutic application of chemically powered
micromotors. In vivo studies examine the therapeutic efficacy,
distribution, and retention of the micromotors in the mouse
stomach compared with passive drug-loaded microparticles and
other control groups, along with the corresponding in vivo
toxicity profile. These results illustrate the attractive therapeutic
capabilities of acid-driven micromotors, which open the door
for in vivo therapeutic applications of body-fluid propelled
micromotors towards the treatment of a variety of diseases and
disorders.
Results
Drug-loaded Mg-micromotors preparation and characteriza-
tion. Figure 1a and Supplementary Movie 1 schematically
illustrate the preparation steps of the drug-loaded Mg-based
micromotors. The cores of the micromotors are made of Mg
microparticles with an average size of ~20 µm. In the study, a
layer of Mg microparticles was dispersed onto a glass slide,
followed by an asymmetrical coating of the microspheres with a
thin
TiO2
layer
using
atomic
layer
deposition
(ALD).
The ALD process leads to a TiO2 uniform coating over the
Mg-microspheres, while leaving a small opening (essential for
contact with the acid fuel) at the sphere-glass contact point36,
which forms a Janus microstructure. Such TiO2 layer acts as a
shell scaffold that maintains the micromotor spherical shape and
the opening size during the propulsion, leading to consistent and
prolonged operation. The Mg-TiO2 Janus microparticles were
then coated with a PLGA film containing the CLR antibiotic
payload. After the drug-loading step, the microparticles were
coated with an outer thin chitosan layer (thickness ~100 nm)
that ensures efficient electrostatic adhesion of the micromotors
to the mucosal layer on the stomach wall while protecting
the CLR-loaded PLGA layer. Finally, the resulting CLR-loaded
Mg-based micromotors were separated and collected by soft
mechanical scratching of the glass slide, leaving a small opening
for spontaneous Mg-acid reaction when the motors are placed
in
an
acidic
solution.
This
reaction
generates
hydrogen
microbubbles and leads to efficient propulsion in the stomach
fluid24. The small opening enables also a slow reaction process
and gradual dissolution of the Mg core, leading to a prolonged
micromotor lifetime of ~6 min. The in vivo self-propulsion in
the gastric fluid of a stomach and the corresponding drug delivery
process from the PLGA layer of the Mg-based micromotors
are illustrated schematically in Fig. 1b and Supplementary
Movie 2.
The ability of drug-loaded Mg-based micromotors to efficiently
propel in gastric acid was first tested in vitro by using a simulated
gastric fluid (pH ~1.3). The microscopic images in Fig. 1c (taken
from Supplementary Movie 3 at 2 min intervals) illustrate the
fast and prolonged autonomous propulsion of a CLR-loaded
Mg-based micromotor in the gastric fluid simulant. The efficient
hydrogen bubble generation propels the micromotors rapidly,
with an average speed of ~120 μm s−1 (corresponding to a relative
speed of 6 body length s−1), and indicates that the Mg-based
micromotors can react and move fast in the gastric fluid. Such
efficient micromotor propulsion is essential for the motors to
reach stomach wall and thus achieving significant therapeutic
efficacy. Importantly, the acid-Mg reaction responsible for the
autonomous propulsion also spontaneously depletes protons in
gastric fluid and thus neutralizes the stomach pH without using
PPIs24.

illustrates
the
structure
of
a
drug-loaded Mg-based micromotor, showing the Mg core,
covered mostly with the TiO2 shell layer, drug-loaded PLGA
layer, and an outer chitosan layer. The drug-loaded Mg-based
micromotors were carefully characterized. The scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) image of a drug-loaded micromotor (shown
in Fig. 1e) confirms the presence of a small opening (~2 µm) on
the spherical micromotor, produced during the coating process,
that exposes the Mg core of the micromotor to the gastric
fluid and facilitates the hydrogen bubble thrust. Energy-dispersive
X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy mapping analysis was carried out
to confirm the motor composition. The resulting EDX images,
shown in Fig. 1f and g, illustrate the presence and distribution
of magnesium and titanium, respectively.
A fluorescence study was carried out to confirm efficient
drug-loading within the PLGA layer, and the coating of the
micromotor with the protective and adhesive chitosan layer.
This was accomplished by preparing Mg-based micromotors
with the PLGA and chitosan coatings containing the fluorescent
dyes

 respectively. An optical image of a dye-loaded micromotor is
displayed in Fig. 1h. The corresponding fluorescence images show
the dye-loaded Mg-based micromotor in the DiD and FITC
channels (Fig. 1i and j, respectively); an overlay of the two
channels is displayed in Fig. 1k. The high-fluorescent intensity
of the loaded dyes confirms the successful coating of the
micromotor with both PLGA and chitosan layers, along with
the high cargo-loading capacity of the micromotor.
Prior to in vivo therapeutic application of the Mg-based
micromotors, several in vitro studies were performed. Initially,
the ability of drug-loaded micromotors to efficiently propel in
gastric acid was tested in vitro. Supplementary Fig. 1a–d displays
time-lapse images (corresponding to Supplementary Movie 4)
showing the motion of the drug-loaded Mg-based micromotors in
simulated gastric fluid adjusted to different pH values (0.75, 1.25,
1.5, and 1.75, respectively). Time-lapse images in Supplementary
Fig. 1e–h show the lifetime of a drug-loaded micromotor in
gastric fluid simulant (pH ~1.3) to be ~6 min. Supplementary
Fig. 1i displays the pH-dependent speed of the micromotor in the
gastric fluid simulant. The micromotor speed drastically decreases
upon changing the pH of the gastric fluid solution from pH
1.5–1.75. Assuming that the stomach pH is 1.3, the drug-loaded
Mg-based micromotors can efficiently move at this condition
with an average speed of ~120 μm s−1 (~6 body length s−1).
Drug-loading optimization and in vitro bactericidal activity.
The CLR-loading onto the Mg-based micromotors was optimized
to achieve a clinically relevant therapeutic concentration of
the drug (15–30 mg kg−1 day−1)37. Figure 2a shows a schematic
displaying the loading of CLR onto the micromotors. Briefly,
the Mg-TiO2 microparticles dispersed onto a glass slide (~2 mg of
Mg microparticles per glass slide) were coated with a PLGA
solution prepared in ethyl acetate, which was mixed with CLR
(see detailed experimental protocol in “Methods” section). Rapid
evaporation under nitrogen current leads to the formation of
a
homogeneous
PLGA-CLR
coating
over
the
Mg-TiO2
microparticles (microscope images of the coated micromotors are
displayed in Fig. 2b). The microparticles were further coated
with chitosan before quantifying the CLR-loading efficiency of
the micromotors. To optimize the drug-loading, Mg-based
micromotors were coated with PLGA solutions containing
different amounts of CLR (between 4 and 6 mg). By studying
different combinations of the PLGA-CLR solution volume and
CLR concentration, the highest CLR-loading efficiency (26%),
corresponding
to 1032 ± 37 µg per 2 mg micromotor, was
obtained when coating the microparticles with 120 µL of
the PLGA solution containing 4.8 mg of CLR (Fig. 2c, II). This
formulation offered optimal CLR-loading and was selected
for subsequent in vitro and in vivo anti-H. pylori studies.
Once confirmed that the micromotors were capable to
load antibiotic cargo with high-loading efficiency, an in vitro
bactericidal
activity
of
CLR-loaded
Mg-based
micromotors
against H. pylori was performed. To mimic the gastric environ-
ment, samples were treated in 0.1 N HCl for 1 h prior to
incubation with bacteria. This also ensured the dissolution of
micromotors and consecutive drug release. Figure 2d shows the
enumerated amount of bacteria after being treated by CLR-loaded
Mg-based micromotors or free CLR solution with varying
concentrations of CLR. According to the results, drug-loaded
micromotors exhibited a comparable bactericidal activity to free
drug solution over the whole range of concentrations used in the
study. Specifically, we determined the minimal bactericidal
concentration (MBC) values of the samples, defined as the
minimal concentration of an antimicrobial agent that kills 3
logs (99.9%) of the bacteria. The MBC value for CLR-loaded
Mg-based micromotors was found to be 0.25 μg mL−1, which was
unaltered from the MBC value of free CLR. Moreover, bare

 Mg-based micromotors, with corresponding amount of motors
and treated under the same conditions as the free CLR and
CLR-loaded Mg-micromotors, were used as negative controls.
From Fig. 2d, the bare motors had negligible effect on the viability
of H. pylori over the studied range, which supports that the
bactericidal effect of CLR-loaded Mg-based micromotors is solely
due to the loaded antibiotics, and not due the other compositions
of the micromotor carrier or the micromotor acidic environment.
Overall, Fig. 2d verifies that the activity of the loaded drug was
not compromised compared to free drug. Our in vitro results
verified also that drug-loaded micromotors, made of Mg and
other degradable materials, eventually destroy themselves and
disappear in the acidic environment after releasing the CLR,
with no apparent residues in the tissue. The findings validate the
potential use of these drug-loaded micromotors for therapeutic
applications.
In vivo micromotor retention in mouse stomach. After the
optimization of drug-loading onto the Mg-based micromotors
and the confirmation of effective in vitro bactericidal activity, the
micromotors were further investigated under in vivo setting.
First,
the
in
vivo
retention
properties
of
the
Mg-based
micromotors on stomach tissue were examined at different
post-administration times, and compared with control groups
administered with DI water (Fig. 3). For this purpose, Mg-based
micromotors prepared with DiD-labeled PLGA and FITC-labeled
chitosan coatings were administered to a group of mice (n = 3),
and following 30 min and 2 h of the samples administration, the
mice were killed and the entire stomach was excised and opened.
Subsequently, the luminal lining was rinsed with PBS and
flattened for imaging. Accordingly, Fig. 3a shows bright-field and
fluorescence images of the luminal lining of freshly excised mouse
stomach at 0 min after oral gavage of DI water, and at 30 min and
2 h after oral gavage of Mg-based micromotors. As can be
observed, the images corresponding to the dye-loaded Mg-based
micromotors show an intense fluorescent signal in both red and
green
light channels,
which indicates
efficient distribution
and retention of the micromotors in the mouse stomach.
The continuous propulsion of the micromotors and the adhesive
properties of the chitosan coating help to achieve a homogeneous
distribution
of
the
micromotors
in
the
stomach.
The
corresponding fluorescence quantification of the dye-loaded
micromotors retained in the mouse stomach after 30 min and
2 h oral gavage of the sample is displayed in Fig. 3b. The graphic
represents the higher fluorescence signals obtained at 665 and
520 nm (corresponding to DiD and FITC dyes, respectively) for
each sample. These results indicate that the micromotors can
effectively propel in gastric fluid and are retained in the stomach
wall, including the antrum, where the H. pylori bacteria reside.
Such highly enhanced retention in the stomach, which is a major
advantage of motor-enabled delivery, has been carefully examined
in our early studies22–24. The powerful propulsion leads to tissue
penetration and binding, so that the drug-loaded motor could
reach the whole stomach wall for enhanced retention.
In vivo anti-H. pylori therapeutic efficacy. We proceeded to test
the in vivo therapeutic efficacy of the drug-loaded Mg-based
micromotors against H. pylori infection. Prior to the therapeutic

 study, we developed H. pylori infection in a mouse model using
C57BL/6 mice. Each mouse was inoculated with 3 × 108 CFU
H. pylori SS1 in brain–heart infusion (BHI) broth by oral gavage
three times on day 3, 5, and 7 (Fig. 4a)38, 39. Two weeks after
inoculation, the H. pylori-infected mice were divided into five
groups (n = 6, for each group) and orally administered with DI
water, blank Mg-based micromotors (without CLR drug), free
CLR drug with PPI (CLR+PPI), CLR-loaded silica microparticles,
or
CLR-loaded
Mg-based
micromotors
once
a
day
for
five consecutive days. On each day of treatment, mice in the
free CLR+PPI group received 400 µmol kg−1 of omeprazole
(as PPI treatment) 30 min before administrating CLR, to
neutralize gastric acid and prevent potential degradation of
CLR. Such PPI dosage has been reported to be effective both in
reducing the gastric acidity in mouse models40, as well as in
preserving the effectiveness of co-administered antibiotics39, 41, 42.
After the treatment course, the bacterial burden was evaluated by
enumerating and comparing H. pylori counts recovered from
each
mouse
stomach.
The
mean
bacterial
burden
from
two negative control groups treated with DI water and blank
Mg-based motors were 2.1 × 107 and 1.4 × 107 CFU g−1 of
stomach tissue, respectively (Fig. 4b, black and orange color,
respectively). Meanwhile, a bacterial burden of 3 × 106 CFU g−1
was measured from the mice treated with CLR-loaded silica
microparticles, which did not show statistical difference to the
negative controls. In contrast, when the mice were treated with
CLR-loaded Mg-based micromotors, the bacterial burden was
quantified as 2.9 × 105 CFU g−1, a significant reduction compared
with the negative control and CLR-loaded silica microparticle
groups. The substantial improvement in H. pylori reduction
demonstrates the benefit of acid-powered Mg-based micromotors
compared with static micron-sized carriers. A bacterial burden of
2.8 × 106 CFU g−1 was obtained for the positive control mice
with free CLR+PPI treatment. Although the difference between
CLR-loaded Mg-based micromotors and the free CLR+PPI
groups
was
not
statistically
significant,
the
CLR-loaded
micromotors reduced the H. pylori burden in mice compared
with in the negative controls by ~1.8 orders of magnitude,
whereas the free CLR+PPI group reduced it only by ~0.8 orders
of magnitude. These results might be derived from the benefit
of the propulsion-enabled active drug delivery performed by
the Mg-based micromotors in the stomach. These results
demonstrate that the Mg-based micromotors can effectively
propel and distribute throughout the stomach of living mice to
significantly reduce H. pylori levels.
In vivo toxicity evaluation of Mg-based micromotors. Finally,
the toxicity profile of the Mg-based micromotors in the stomach
as well as in the lower GI tract was evaluated. Healthy mice were
orally administered with Mg-based micromotors or DI water
once daily for five consecutive days. Throughout the treatment,
no signs of distress such as squinting of eyes, hunched posture,
unkempt fur, or lethargy were observed in both groups. Initially,
the toxicity profile of the Mg-micromotors in the mouse
was evaluated through changes in body weight. During the
experimental
period,
mice
administered
Mg-micromotors
maintained
a
constant
body
weight
compared
with
the
mice administered DI water (Fig. 5a). On day 6, mice were killed
and their stomachs and lower GI sections were processed
for histological staining. Longitudinal sections of the glandular
stomach (Fig. 5b), three major segments of small intestine
(duodenum, jejunum, and ileum, Fig. 5c–e, respectively) and the
two major segments of large intestine (proximal and distal colon,
Fig. 5f–g, respectively) were stained with hematoxylin and
eosin (H&E). The stomach and lower GI sections of the
micromotor-treated group showed undamaged structure of
columnar epithelial cells with no signs of superficial degeneration
or erosion (Fig. 5b–g, left). There was no noticeable difference in
the
gastric
and
intestinal
mucosal
integrity,
in
terms
of
thickness as well as size and number of crypt and villus, between
the motor-treated and DI water-treated groups (Fig. 5b–g, left vs.

No

infiltration
into
the
mucosa
and submucosa was observed, indicating no sign of gastric
inflammation.

micromotors showed no effect on the mouse body weight,

that

of
Mg-based
micromotors is safe in the mouse model.
Conclusions
In this work we conducted the first, to the best of our knowledge,
study to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of a drug-loaded
Mg-based micromotor for in vivo treatment of H. pylori infection
in
a
mouse
model.
Through
these
in
vivo
experiments,
we demonstrated that acid-powered Mg-based micromotors
could efficiently be loaded with clinical doses of drugs, retain in
the
mouse
stomach
wall,
and
perform
an
appreciable
in vivo bactericidal activity. Our results showed that the active
propulsion of drug-loaded Mg-based micromotors in the acidic
media of the stomach and motor-tissue interaction lead to
efficient drug delivery and hence to a significant reduction of
bacteria burden compared to passive drug carriers. Furthermore,
such drug-loaded micromotors function in gastric condition
for the H. pylori infection treatment without the need of PPIs.
We also demonstrated that there were no toxicological con-
sequences of the micromotors in the mouse models. Overall, our

 results indicate that micromotors may be adapted to the devel-
opment of new and safe therapeutic treatments against stomach
diseases such as H. pylori infection. As our early studies have
shown that the Mg-based micromotors can propel efficiently and
position
precisely
in
the
GI
tract23,
24,
we
believe
the
presented motor-enabled delivery approach is promising to treat
diverse GI tract diseases. Extending the propulsion methods
with new alternative biocompatible fuels43,
44 or fuel-free
actuation11–13 might be able to expand the active-delivery
concept to different parts of the body. We also envision
that the micromotor approach will be useful for eliminating
hard-to-treat bacterial biofilms,45, 46 with the efficient motor
propulsion leading to biofilm penetration towards enhanced
antibiotic delivery. Although the present results are promising,
this work is still at its early stage. As a new active gastric delivery
technology, future studies are required to further elucidate the
micromotor’s in vivo delivery performance and functions, and to
compare with other standard therapies against H. pylori infection
or other gastric diseases. Nonetheless, this work opens the door to
the use of synthetic motors as an active-delivery platform for
in vivo treatment of diseases and will likely trigger intensive
research interests in this area.
Methods
Synthesis of Mg-based micromotors. The Mg-based micromotors were prepared
using magnesium (Mg) microparticles (catalog #FMW20, TangShan WeiHao
Magnesium Powder Co.; average size, 20 ± 5 μm) as the core. The Mg
microparticles were initially washed with acetone to eliminate the presence of
impurities. After being dried under a N2 current, the Mg microparticles were

 dispersed onto glass slides (2 mg of Mg microparticles per glass slide), followed by
ALD of TiO2 (at 100 °C for 120 cycles) using a Beneq TFS 200 system. As such an
ALD process utilizes gas phase reactants, it leads to uniform coatings over the Mg
microparticles, whereas still leaving a small opening at the contact point of the
particle to the glass slide. After that, the Janus micromotors were coated with 120
µL of 1% (w/v) PLGA (Sigma-Aldrich, P2191) prepared in ethyl acetate
(Sigma-Aldrich, 270989) and containing 40 mg mL−1 CLR (TCI CO., Ltd. C220).
It should be noted that different CLR amounts (between 4 mg and 6 mg) were
tested to optimize the drug-loading. The PLGA@CLR coating was dried fast to
avoid crystallization of the drug. Finally, the Janus micromotors were coated with
a thin layer of 0.05% (w/v) Chit (Sigma-Aldrich, C3646) prepared in water and
containing 0.1% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) (Sigma-Aldrich, 62862)
and 0.02% (v/v) acetic acid (Sigma-Aldrich, 695092), forming the outermost layer
coated on the Mg microparticles. Finally, the Mg-based micromotors were collected
by lightly scratching the microparticles off the glass slide.
Synthesis of dye-loaded Mg-based micromotors. For performing the
characterization of the Mg-based micromotors along with the in vivo retention
studies, fluorescent Mg-based micromotors were prepared by combining both 1%
PLGA and 0.05% Chit solutions with 5 µg mL−1 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetra-
methylindodicarbocyanine, 4-chlorobenzenesulfonate salt (DiD, λex = 644 nm/λem
= 665 nm, Life Technologies, D7757) and 1 µg mL−1 fluorescein isothiocyanate-
dextran (FITC, λex = 492 nm/λem = 520 nm, Sigma-Aldrich, 46945) dyes, respec-
tively. To compare with the Mg-based micromotors, inert silica (Si) microparticles
(Nanocs, Inc., Cat. No. Si01-20u-1; 20 µm size) were used as core particles, fol-
lowing the same protocol described above.
Micromotor characterization. Bright-field and fluorescent images of the
Mg-based micromotors and inert silica microparticles (Supplementary Fig. 2) were
captured using a EVOS FL microscope coupled with a ×20 and ×40 microscope
objectives and fluorescence filters for red and green light excitation.
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the Mg-based micromotors
were obtained with a Phillips XL30 ESEM instrument, using an acceleration voltage
of 10 kV. EDX mapping analysis was performed using an Oxford EDX detector
attached to SEM instrument and operated by INCA software.
Micromotor propulsion studies. Autonomous Mg-based micromotors propulsion
in simulated gastric fluid (Sigma-Aldrich, 01651) was obtained by diluting 25 times
the simulated gastric fluid according to the commercial specifications (final pH
~1.3), and adding 1% Triton X-100 (Fisher Scientific, FairLawn, NJ, USA) as
surfactant. An inverted optical microscope (Nikon Eclipse 80i upright microscope)
coupled with different microscope objectives (×10, ×20, and ×40) and a
QuantEM:512SC camera were used for recording the autonomous micromotor
propulsion in the gastric fluid simulant. The speed of the Mg-based
micromotors was characterized using the MetaMorph 7.1 software (Molecular
Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA).
In vitro anti-H. pylori activity. H. pylori Sydney strain 1 (HPSS1) was cultured
from frozen stock and routinely maintained on Columbia agar supplemented with
5% (vol/vol) laked horse blood at 37 °C under microaerobic conditions (10% CO2,
85% N2, and 5% O2). For experiments, broth cultures of H. pylori were prepared by
subculturing fresh colonies from agar plates into brain–heart infusion (BHI)
supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and incubated overnight at 37 °C
under microaerobic conditions with moderate reciprocal shaking. An overnight
broth culture of H. pylori was centrifuged at 5000×g for 10 min to obtain a bacterial
pellet. After removal of culture medium by centrifugation, the obtained bacteria
pellet was then suspended in an appropriate amount of fresh BHI with 5% FBS for
future use.
The bactericidal activity against H. pylori of free CLR and CLR-loaded
Mg-based micromotors (PLGA@CLR-TiO2-Mg) were tested in vitro. All samples
were treated in 0.1 N HCl for 1 h and serially diluted to desired concentrations with
PBS (pH 7). Bare Mg-based micromotors (PLGA-TiO2-Mg) with corresponding
amount of micromotors were used as negative control.
The samples were added with 1 × 106 CFU mL−1 H. pylori in BHI with 5% FBS
to make final concentrations of 0–16 μg mL−1 CLR, followed by incubation at 37 °C
under microaerobic conditions with moderate reciprocal shaking for 24 h. Then, a
series of 10-fold dilutions of the bacterial suspension was prepared, and inoculated
onto a Columbia agar plates supplemented with 5% laked horse blood. The plates
were cultured for 4 days before the colony-forming unit (CFU) of H. pylori was
quantified. All measurements were made in triplicate.
In vivo micromotor retention. Prior to the experiment, C57BL/6 mice (n = 3)
were fed with alfalfa-free food from LabDiet (St Louis, MO, USA) for 2 weeks. The
in vivo retention study was performed by using dye-loaded Mg-based micromotors
prepared by the protocol described above. A 0.3 mL suspension of Mg-based
micromotors with DiD-labeled PLGA and FITC-labeled chitosan coatings were
intragastrically administered. A group of mice was administered with DI water as a
negative control. Following 30 min and 2 h of oral administrations, the mice were
killed and their entire stomachs were excised and cut opened along the greater
curvature. Then, the tissues were rinsed with PBS, flattened, and visualized using a
Keyence BZ-X700 fluorescence microscope. The bright-field and corresponding
fluorescence images were obtained at 665 and 520 nm (DiD and FITC, respectively)
for each sample. Subsequently, the tissues were transferred to 1 mL PBS and
homogenized. Analysis of the amount of micromotors retained in the
stomachs was carried out by measuring the fluorescence intensity of their
embedded DiD-labeled PLGA and FITC-labeled chitosan using Synergy Mx
fluorescent spectrophotometer (Biotek, Winooski, VT, USA). All animal
experiments were in compliance with the University of California San Diego
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) regulations.
In vivo therapeutic efficacy against H. pylori infection. Six-week-old C57BL/6
male mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA).
Each C57BL/6 mouse received 0.3 mL of 1 × 109 CFU mL−1 H. pylori in BHI broth
administered intragastrically through oral gavage every 48 h, repeated three times
(on day 3, 5, and 7, respectively), and the infection was allowed to develop for
2 weeks39. For the in vivo anti-H. pylori therapeutic study, mice were randomly
divided in five treatment groups (n = 6) to be orally administered once daily for five
consecutive days with CLR-loaded Mg-based micromotors, CLR-loaded inert
silica microparticles, free CLR+PPI, blank Mg-based micromotors or DI water.
For free CLR+PPI group, each day of treatment mice were first administered
with omeprazole (a PPI) through oral gavage at a dose of 400 μmol kg−139, 40–42,
followed by a lag time of 30 min before administration of CLR. CLR-loaded
Mg-based micromotors, CLR-loaded inert silica microparticles and free CLR
(with 30 mg kg−1 CLR dosage) were also administered through oral gavage once
daily for five consecutive days39. Blank Mg-based micromotors and DI water
served as movement control and negative control, respectively. Forty-eight hours
after last administration39, 47–49, mice were killed and stomachs were excised
from the abdominal cavity. The stomachs were cut along the greater curvature, and
the gastric content were removed and rinsed with PBS. For H. pylori recovery,
each gastric tissue was weighed before suspended in 200 μL PBS and homogenized.
The homogenate was serially diluted and spotted onto Columbia agar plate
with 5% laked horse blood and Skirrow’s supplement (10 μg mL−1 vancomycin,
5 μg mL−1 trimethoprim lactate, and 2500 IU/L polymyxin B; Oxiod). The plates
were then incubated at 37 °C under microaerobic conditions for 5 days, and bac-
terial colonies were enumerated. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way
ANOVA. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. Studies
were done in a non-blinded fashion. Replicates represent different mice subjected
to the same treatment (n = 6). All animal experiments were in compliance with
the University of California San Diego Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee (IACUC) regulations.
Toxicity evaluation of Mg-based micromotors. To evaluate the acute toxicity of
the Mg-based micromotors in vivo, uninfected C57BL/6 male mice (n = 6)
weighing 25–30 g were orally administered with CLR-loaded micromotors once
daily for five consecutive days. Mice administered with DI water were tested in
parallel as a negative control. During the experimental period, the mouse body
weight was monitored by weighing the mice daily. On day 6, mice were killed and
sections of the mouse stomach, small and large intestine tissues were processed for
histological examination. The stomach was cut open along the greater curvature,
and the gastric content was removed. The small and large intestines were cut to
small sections as duodenum, jejunum, ileum, proximal, and distal colon and rinsed
inside with PBS to remove internal residues. The longitudinal tissue sections were
fixed in neutral-buffered 10% (vol/vol) formalin for 15 h, transferred into 70%
ethanol, and embedded in paraffin. The tissue sections were cut with 5 μm
thickness and stained with H&E assay. The stained sections were visualized by
Hamamatsu NanoZoomer 2.0HT and the images processed using NDP viewing
software. All animal experiments were in compliance with the University of
California San Diego Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC)
regulations.
