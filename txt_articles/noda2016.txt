Abstract: This study aimed to assess the presence of macrolide-resistant
Treponema pallidum subtypes in Havana, Cuba. Samples from 41 syphilis
patients were tested for T. pallidum 23S rRNA gene mutations. Twenty-five
patients (61%) harbored T. pallidum with the A2058G mutation, which was
present in all 8 subtypes that were identified. The A2059G mutation was
not detected.
S
yphilis is a multistage, sexually transmitted disease (STD) that
remains a significant public health problem in many coun-
tries.1 Because there is no vaccine to prevent infection with Trep-
onema pallidum subsp. pallidum (T. pallidum), the causative
agent of syphilis, antibiotic treatment is a key component of syph-
ilis control programs. The US Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention 2015 guidelines for treatment of STDs2 recommend
benzathine penicillin G, administered parenterally, as the first-
line drug for treatment of all stages of syphilis. Second-line drugs,
including macrolides, such as azithromycin, have been used for
the treatment of syphilis in nonpregnant patients who are
penicillin-allergic. However, in 2004, treatment failures were re-
ported in several patients in the United States after azithromycin
therapy for syphilis.3 Sequencing of the T. pallidum 23S rRNA
gene in samples from these patients identified a point mutation
(A/G) cognate to position A2058 in the Escherichia coli 23S rRNA
gene. This mutation is identical to a previously described mutation
that confers high-level macrolide resistance in T. pallidum Street
strain 14.4 Treponema pallidum with the A2058G mutation is
now geographically widespread, with higher prevalence rates in
North America, Europe, and Asia.5–9 In 2009, a second T. pallidum
23S rRNA gene mutation, A2059G, was described in samples
from a Czech Republic syphilis patient who failed spiramycin
therapy.10 Treponema pallidum with the A2059G mutation has
been detected recently in the United Kingdom, the United
States, and China.5,6,11,12
According to data from the Ministry of Public Health, the
syphilis rate per 100,000 population in Cuba increased from
12.6 in 2009 to 36.2 in 2014.13 The sudden increase of syphilis,
combined with the lack of information on the susceptibility of
T. pallidum to macrolide drugs, was the motivation for this study
that aimed to determine the presence of the A2058G and
A2059G point mutations in T. pallidum subtypes from Cuban
syphilis patients. The study was conducted at the Tropical Medi-
cine Institute ¨Pedro Kourí¨ (IPK) in Havana, Cuba from
September 2012 to September 2015. The study protocol was ap-
proved by the IPK Research Ethics Committee and was conducted
in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed
consent was obtained from each patient. Demographic and clinical
data were recorded at the time of the patient visit. Forty-one male
patients whose genital lesion swabs tested positive for T. pallidum
DNA based on amplification of the polA gene14 were included in
the study. Detection of the 23S rRNA gene A2058G and A2059G
point mutations was based on restriction fragment length polymor-
phism analysis according to Lukehart et al.7 To confirm the pres-
ence of a mutation, amplicon DNA was sequenced using the
GenomeLab Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing with Quick Start
Kit (Beckman Coulter, Washington, DC). Molecular subtyping
of T. pallidum was based on analysis of the arp and tpr genes using
an established method.15 Enhanced typing with the tp0548 gene
was not possible due to insufficient sample DNA. Genomic
DNA from T. pallidum Nichols strain (subtype 14a; macrolide-
sensitive wild-type, WT) and T. pallidum Street strain 14 (subtype
14f; macrolide-resistant with the A2058G mutation) served as
controls for restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis
of the 23S rRNA gene and for subtyping. Molecular grade water
served as the negative control.
Characteristics of the 41 syphilis patients are summarized
in Table 1. The median age of the patients was 27 years. Seventy-
eight percent of the patients were men who have sex with men
and 68.3% were human immunodeficiency virus-positive at the
time of syphilis diagnosis. A history of prior syphilis was recorded
for 7.3% of the patients. Twenty-five patients (61%, 25/41) har-
bored T. pallidum with the A2058G mutation whereas none of
the patients harbored T. pallidum with the A2059G mutation. De-
spite an increase in syphilis rates, there was not a substantial in-
crease per year in the percentage of patients harboring T. pallidum
with the A2058G mutation during the study period. Several re-
searchers have reported variable prevalence rates for macrolide-
resistant T. pallidum from different geographical locations (eg, 0.7%
in Taiwan to nearly 100% in China).9,16,17 Although macrolide-
resistant T. pallidum has become increasing prevalent in the
United States,18 Europe,6,19,20 China,9 and Australia,21 it appears
to be uncommon in some countries, such as Madagascar,22
Taiwan,16,23 and South Africa.24 The high prevalence of macrolide-
resistant T. pallidum in Havana may be related to the extensive use
of azithromycin in clinical practice. This drug is widely
prescribed for the treatment of respiratory and skin infections
and other STDs, providing a selective pressure for the emergence

 of macrolide-resistant T. pallidum that may be stably maintained in
the absence of macrolide selection.5 Mitchell et al.25 and Marra
et al.26 reported that patients who had taken macrolides before
syphilis diagnosis (ie, within 30 days or within 12 months,
respectively) were more likely to harbour macrolide-resistant
T. pallidum. We observed that 28% (7/25) of Cuban patients
who harbored T. pallidum with the A2058G mutation, compared
with 12.5% (2/16) of patients who harbored WT T. pallidum,
had taken azithromycin within 15 days before syphilis diagnosis.
Thus, there was not a significant association between recent
macrolide use and the presence of the A2058G mutation in the
Cuban patients (P > 0.1).
Genital lesion swabs from 37 patients (90%, 37/41) were
positive for the arp and tpr genes, enabling determination of the
T. pallidum subtype. Despite the limited number of patients, 8 sub-
types were detected [14f (29.8%, 11/37), 14d (21.6%, 8/37), 12a
and 12f (13.5%, 5/37 of each), 10f (8.1%, 3/37), 7f and 14a
(5.4%, 2/37 of each), and 10d (2.7%, 1/37)]. The presence of the
A2058G mutation in all of the subtypes suggests that multiple
macrolide-resistant T. pallidum subtypes are circulating in Havana
(Fig. 1). Although the A2058G mutation appeared to be more
commonly associated with subtype 14d, this was not supported
by further analysis. Generally, there is not a strong association of
the A2058G mutation with a particular T. pallidum subtype. Nev-
ertheless, during 2007 to 2009, the A2058G mutation was com-
monly associated with subtype 14d in Canada.27
This study is the first to provide molecular evidence of the
presence of azithromycin-resistant T. pallidum subtypes in syphilis
patients in Cuba. Our results suggest that azithromycin is not an
appropriate choice as a second-line drug for the treatment of
syphilis
in
penicillin-allergic
patients
in
Havana
because
macrolide resistance appears to be common, particularly in men
who have sex with men. However, because the number of patients
was relatively small and limited to the IPK STD clinic, we recog-
nize that our results may not be a true representation of the preva-
lence of azithromycin-resistant T. pallidum in Havana. We suggest
that further surveillance of azithromycin-resistant T. pallidum sub-
types is needed to improve the management of Cuban syphilis pa-
tients and to inform syphilis treatment guidelines.
