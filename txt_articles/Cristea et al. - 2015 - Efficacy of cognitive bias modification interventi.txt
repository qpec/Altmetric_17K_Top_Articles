 Cognitive bias modification (CBM) has been defined as the ‘direct
manipulation of a target cognitive bias, by extended exposure to
task contingencies that favor predetermined patterns of processing
selectivity’.1 A recent review remarks that there has been
‘exponential growth of research employing these cognitive bias
modification (CBM) procedures’
,1 especially in recent years.
Research has focused mainly on two types of interventions1:
attention
bias
modification
(ABM)
and
interpretative
bias
modification (CBM-I). Another narrative review2 concludes that
both ABM and CBM-I can reliably have an impact on clinically
relevant
symptoms,
with
greatest
confidence
for
anxiety
symptoms and depression. The principle of ABM involves
teaching participants to avoid the negative, ‘threat’ stimuli
(usually pictures or words) by directing their attention, without
their knowledge, to neutral or positive stimuli (‘avoid threat’).
The principle of CBM-I1,3 is similar, but it uses more complex
stimuli, such as ambiguous paragraphs or sentences. Participants
are given a task that consistently disambiguates the valence of
the sentence or paragraph (for example a word completion
task), towards a positive (sometimes neutral) or a negative
interpretation. Other interventions are also included under
CBM, such as concreteness training (CNT)4 or alcohol approach
and avoidance training (A-AAT).5
Three previous meta-analyses examined the efficiency of
various CBM approaches for psychological problems. The first6
looked at studies of ABM for anxiety and found an effect size of
0.61. The second one7 investigated both ABM and CBM-I for
anxiety and depression and found a small, but significant post-
intervention effect for anxiety and depression taken together
(g = 0.13). Finally, the third meta-analysis8 found non-significant
effects for subjective experience following ABM. The present
meta-analysis was prompted by a number of aspects that still
remain unclear regarding the efficacy of CBM interventions. It is
not clear if the previous meta-analyses were carried out on
randomised controlled trials (RCTs). For instance, one of these6
mentioned randomisation as an inclusion criterion, but out of
11 studies, two were experiments described in a narrative review,
for which no independent, peer-reviewed publication as separate
RCTs existed.3 Another7 did not list randomisation as an inclusion
criterion. Second, the quality of the studies included was not
considered in any of the previous meta-analyses, even though
there is ample evidence that the quality of the RCTs included in
a meta-analysis can significantly bias outcomes,9–13 especially for
smaller
trials.12
Some
CBM
researchers
themselves14
have
suggested that the field is overly reliant on small studies, the vast
majority of which do not follow the Consolidated Standards of
Reporting trials (CONSORT) guidelines.15 Third, moderators of
treatment effects that were considered were generally restricted
to the purported mechanisms of action of CBM interventions
(change in targeted bias), and to specific procedural details of
the interventions (such as stimulus type, stimulus duration,
stimulus orientation, number of trials). Finally, publication bias
was analysed in earlier meta-analyses, but with quite different
results. Our goal was to present an updated meta-analysis
including all CBM interventions tested in RCTs for clinically
relevant
outcomes.
A
number
of
RCTs
examining
CBM
interventions have been conducted since the three previous
meta-analysis were published (we counted 18 new trials). We
aimed to examine whether there is robust empirical evidence of
strong methodological quality (i.e. reduced risk of bias) for the
clinical efficacy of CBM interventions. CBM is ultimately advocated
as a therapy, with the purpose of significantly reducing symptoms
and distress, so its efficacy has to be clearly established in clinical
samples. Finally, we wanted to analyse more general moderators of
treatment response, relevant to most psychotherapies.
Method
Identification and selection of studies
We conducted a comprehensive literature search (see online
supplement DS1) for the complete search string) in PubMed,
PsycInfo, the Cochrane library and EMBASE through May 2013
using the following key words: ‘‘cognitive bias modification’’,
‘‘attention* bias modification’’, ‘‘attention’’ bias ‘‘training’’, ‘‘bias
training’’, ‘‘interpret* bias modification’’. We checked the reference

Efficacy of cognitive bias modification interventions
in anxiety and depression: meta-analysis
Ioana A. Cristea, Robin N. Kok and Pim Cuijpers
Background
Cognitive bias modification (CBM) interventions are strongly
advocated in research and clinical practice.
Aims
To examine the efficiency of CBM for clinically relevant
outcomes, along with study quality, publication bias and
potential moderators.
Method
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of CBM
interventions that reported clinically relevant outcomes
assessed with standardised instruments.
Results
We identified 49 trials and grouped outcomes into anxiety
and depression. Effect sizes were small considering all the
samples, and mostly non-significant for patient samples.
Effect sizes became non-significant when outliers were
excluded and after adjustment for publication bias. The
quality of the RCTs was suboptimal.
Conclusions
CBM may have small effects on mental health problems, but
it is also very well possible that there are no significant
clinically relevant effects. Research in this field is hampered
by small and low-quality trials, and by risk of publication bias.
Many positive outcomes are driven by extreme outliers.
Declaration of interest
None.

Review article
 sections of the three previous meta-analyses. We also periodically
checked for newly published trials during the preparation of the
meta-analysis until the end of September 2013.
We included studies in which: (a) participants were randomised
and (b) the effect of a CBM intervention, alone or in combination
with another treatment, was (c) compared to the effects of a
control group, another active treatment or a combination of
treatments, (d) in adults, (e) for clinically relevant outcomes, (f)
assessed
on
established,
standardised
symptom
or
distress
measures and (g) published in peer-reviewed scientific journals
in English. We included studies that combined a CBM inter-
vention
with
another
active
treatment
(psychological
or
pharmacological), provided that there was a control condition
for the CBM intervention (i.e. a group that received no CBM
intervention, a no-contingency intervention, an intervention
supposed to increase bias), whether alone or combined with
another active treatment.
We considered active CBM interventions the ones designed to
decrease bias, regardless of its type, and consequently that
improved symptoms and mood. As relevant outcome measures,
we excluded outcomes not related to clinical symptoms or distress,
as well as outcomes that were not measured on established,
standardised, instruments (for example, reaction times, biological
data, data measured on Likert or visual analogue scales devised ad
hoc). Dissertations and conference abstracts were not included.
Quality assessment and data extraction
The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed
with five criteria of the risk of bias assessment tool, developed
by the Cochrane Collaboration16 to assess sources of bias in RCTs.
(a) Criterion 1: adequate generation of allocation sequence.
(b) Criterion 2: concealment of allocation to conditions.
(c) Criterion
3: prevention of
knowledge of
the allocated
intervention to assessors of outcome.
(d) Criterion
4: prevention of
knowledge of
the allocated
intervention to participants.
(e) Criterion 5: dealing with incomplete data.
Criterion 4 (masking of participants) was included because
unlike other psychotherapy studies, in which it is impossible for
participants to remain unaware of the allocated intervention, most
CBM interventions are carried out without making participants
aware of the contingency they are exposed to, the purpose of
the intervention or, in some cases, even the fact they are being
subjected to an intervention. In fact, lack of participant awareness
of the training has been regarded as evidence of the implicit
mechanism of action of these interventions, through modifying
low-level biases, which are inaccessible to awareness.1,14 Criterion
5 (dealing with incomplete data) was rated as positive if there were
no missing data or if data were analysed in an intent-to-treat
approach (meaning all randomised participants were included
in the analysis). Risk of bias was rated by two independent
researchers (I.C. and R.K.). Disagreements were discussed and if
they remained unresolved, the senior author was consulted (P.C.).
We also coded several aspects of the included studies, as
potential moderators.
(a) Type of sample: clinical – diagnosed using a structured clinical
interview (such as Structured Clinical Interview for DSM
Disorders (SCID)); subclinical/analogue – selected for high
values on a scale for clinical symptoms or distress; unselected
participants.
(b) Recruitment type: patient samples; community volunteers;
university students.
(c) Delivery type: exclusively laboratory-based; including a home-
based component.
(d) Participant compensation: yes (money, course credit, both);
no (no type of compensation).
(e) Number of sessions.
(f) Publication year.
(g) Type of bias intervention: attentional (ABM); interpretational
(CBM-I); other (CNT, A-AAT, combinations).
(h) Impact factor (from Web of Science) of the journal in which
the study was published (at the time of publication).
This last moderator was chosen for exploratory analysis, since
we noticed both CBM trials and CBM reviews have been
published in top-tier journals in the field of clinical psychology.
Other researchers have also noted the tremendous surge of interest
in CBM interventions.7,17 Top journals have dedicated special
issues (for example Journal of Abnormal Psychology, February
2009; Cognitive Therapy & Research, April 2014) to CBM inter-
ventions. Although we acknowledge there are intrinsic problems
with journal metrics such as the impact factor, it still can be seen
as an indicator for the best articles in a given field. We wanted to
examine whether there might be a trend of positive CBM results
getting published in higher impact factor journals.
Meta-analysis
For each comparison between a CBM intervention (alone or in
combination) and a comparison group, the effect size indicating
the differences between the two groups at post-test was calculated
(Cohen’s d or standardised mean difference). The effect size were
calculated by subtracting, at post-test, the mean score of the CBM
group from the mean score of the comparison group, and dividing
the result by the pooled standard deviation the two groups.
According to Cohen,18 effect sizes of 0.2 are considered small,
whereas effect sizes of 0.5 are moderate and effect sizes of 0.8
are deemed large. Because a substantial proportion of studies
had small sample sizes, we corrected the effect size for small
sample bias, as recommended by Hedges & Olkin,19 and reported
the corrected indicator Hedges’ g.
We calculated and pooled the individual effect sizes with
Comprehensive Meta-analysis (CMA; version 2.2.064 for Windows).
As there was a lot of variability in the symptom outcomes
considered and the instruments used to measure them, we
grouped outcome measures into the following categories: anxiety
– all (all anxiety outcomes, whether measured by disorder-specific
or general anxiety instruments); general anxiety (all outcomes
relating to general anxiety, such as the State-Trait Anxiety
Inventory,
excluding
outcomes
specific
to
various
anxiety
disorders); social anxiety; depression. If a study used more than
one outcome from the same category or if the same outcome
was measured by more than one instrument, an average effect size
was computed. If means and standard deviations were not
reported for the symptom outcomes in a study, we used the
procedures recommended by CMA20 to calculate the standardised
mean difference from dichotomous data or from other statistics
such as t-values or exact P-values. If the effect size could not be
calculated, the study was excluded. For the studies that had more
than one control group (i.e. sham/no contingency training, attend
to threat or waitlist), we used only one control group to calculate
effect size. We chose the group most similar to a placebo group
(i.e. sham training), as this was the most common control
condition in CBM studies. Also, this decision was made to reduce
8
Cristea et al
 Cognitive bias modification meta-analysis
effect size inflation attributable to non-specific effects of the inter-
vention or to the fact that the control condition was supposed to
achieve an opposite effect from the intervention.
We only reported effect sizes for post-test. Neither follow-up,
nor post-challenge (i.e. after the confrontation with a stressor)
data were considered because of considerable variability among
studies. For follow-up, there was considerable variability regarding
duration, and there was hardly any control as to whether
participants underwent some other treatment in that period.
For post-challenge data, the types of stressors used were extremely
diverse (for example public speaking situation, contamination, a
test), as were the outcome measures, which in most cases were
not standardised (for example reaction times, ad hoc Likert scales).
We report results from two meta-analyses: one containing all
participant samples, the other one including only studies in which
participants were diagnosed with a clinical condition, by use of a
standardised
diagnostic
interview
(such
as
SCID,
Anxiety
Disorders Interview Schedule (ADIS)). To facilitate clinical
interpretation, we also transformed the standardised mean
difference into number needed to treat (NNT), using the formulae
of Kraemer & Kupfer.21 The NNT represents the number of
patients that would have to be treated to generate one additional
positive outcome.22
We expected considerable heterogeneity among studies and
consequently decided to calculate mean effect sizes using a
random effects model. To test for the homogeneity of effect sizes,
we calculated the I2 statistic, which indicates heterogeneity in
percentages. A value of 0% indicates no observed heterogeneity,
whereas as values over 0% refer to increasing heterogeneity, with
25% low, 50% moderate and 75% or above indicative of high
heterogeneity.23 We calculated 95% confidence intervals around
I 2,24 using the non-central w2-based approach with the heterogi
module for Stata MP 13.1 for Mac.25 We also calculated the
Q-statistic, but only report whether it is significant. Outliers were
defined as studies in which the 95% confidence interval was
outside the 95% confidence interval of the pooled studies (on both
sides of the confidence interval). Subgroup and meta-regression
analyses were conducted with outliers removed.
Subgroup analyses were conducted using a mixed-effects
model, in which studies within subgroups are pooled using the
random-effects model, but tests for significant differences between
subgroups are carried out using a fixed-effects model. Subgroups
with fewer than three studies were not reported. For continuous
moderator variables, we used meta-regression analyses to test
whether there was a significant relationship between each of these
variables and the effect size, and reported a Z-value and an
associated P. We also conducted multivariate meta-regression
analysis using the Stata program, both by including all moderators
simultaneously, and by using a back-step procedure, removing the
predictor with the highest P-value at each step.
Publication bias was assessed by visually inspecting the funnel
plot for the main outcome categories and employing the trim and
fill procedure of Duval & Tweedie26 (as implemented in CMA,
version 2.2.064), to obtain an estimate of the effect size after the
publication bias has been taken into account. We also conducted
Egger’s test of the intercept to test the symmetry of the funnel plot.
Results
Selection and inclusion of studies
We examined a total of 738 records (356 after duplicates were
removed) and excluded 264 based on inspection of the abstract.
We retrieved the full text of the remaining 92 articles, totalling
97 trials. Figure 1 presents the flowchart of the inclusion process
and details the reasons for the exclusion of trials, following the
PRISMA statement.27 This process resulted in 44 published
articles, with a total of 49 RCTs that met our inclusion criteria
and were included in the meta-analysis.
Characteristics of included studies
We conducted the analyses only for post-test data, which totalled
52 comparisons from 49 RCTs (see online supplement DS2 for the
complete list). Two RCTs5,28 only reported follow-up symptom
data. These studies were rated for descriptive characteristics, but
did not contribute to post-test outcomes.
The number of intervention sessions ranged from 1 to 15, but
21 RCTs included only one session. Fifteen RCTs used unselected
participants, 16 subclinical or analogue samples, 16 clinical
mental-problem samples and 2 samples with a physical problem
(pain).
In total, 24 studies recruited participants from student
samples, 15 from community volunteers, 9 patient samples and
1 was from general medical patients. Thirty-six comparisons were
based on interventions carried out exclusively in the laboratory,
while 13 also included a home component. Participants received
compensation for participation (money, course credit or both)
in 27 RCTs, and did not receive any compensation in 22 studies.
There were 22 comparisons based on ABM interventions, whereas

23 were based on CBM-I and 4 on other types of bias interventions
(2 for CNT and 2 for A-AAT). Six RCTs were published in journals
with an impact factor under 2, 24 in journals with an impact factor
between 2 and 4, and 13 over 4 (impact factors for the other
studies at the time of publication could not be retrieved). Online
Table DS1 presents selected characteristics of the included RCTs.
Quality of the included studies
Overall, the quality of the included RCTs was not optimal. More
than two-thirds of the studies (33/49) met fewer than three of
the five quality criteria considered. One-fifth of the included RCTs
(10/49) did not meet any quality criteria, and only 4% (5/49) met
all criteria. Figure 2 presents the percentage of studies with a low,
unclear (i.e. not enough information) and high risk of bias, for
each of the quality criteria. It is worth mentioning that for all
criteria except handling incomplete outcome data, a sizeable
proportion of the RCTs (71% for sequence generation, 84% for
allocation concealment, 57% for masking of assessors and 39%
for masking of participants) did not provide the information
necessary for assessing whether the criteria were met.
CBM compared with a control condition: all samples
Main effect sizes for all outcome categories
Anxiety (all measures).
Figure 3 displays the forest plot of
the standardised effect sizes of CBM interventions. The mean
effect size was a g of 0.37 (95% CI 0.20–0.54) for 38 RCTs (41
comparisons). Heterogeneity was high (I 2 = 72.66%) and highly
significant (Table 1 and see online Table DS2 for a more detailed
version of this table). Three studies were included in which two
CBM interventions were compared with the same control group,
meaning that multiple comparisons from these studies were not
independent from each other. Their use in the same analyses could
have affected the pooled effect size by leading to an artificial
reduction of heterogeneity. We conducted sensitivity analyses
including only one effect size per study to examine these possible
effects, by first including only the comparisons with the largest
effect sizes from each study and then only the ones with the
smallest effect sizes. The resulting effect size and heterogeneity
were very close to the ones found in the overall analysis. Three
studies (four comparisons) were identified as outliers. With their
removal, the effect size decreased to a g of 0.23 (95% CI 0.14–0.32)
and heterogeneity became non-significant.
Anxiety (general).
The mean effect size was a g of 0.38 (95% CI
0.17–0.59) for 31 RCTs (34 comparisons). Heterogeneity was high
(I 2 = 76.98%) and highly significant. Sensitivity analysis were
conducted in the same way as for anxiety (all measures), with
results remaining similar to the overall analysis. With the
exclusion of four outliers, the effect size decreased to 0.18 (95%
CI 0.08–0.28) and heterogeneity became non-significant.
Social anxiety.
Ten RCTs with ten comparisons resulted in a g of
0.40 (95% CI 0.06–0.74). Heterogeneity was high (I 2 = 74.62%)
and highly significant. Removal of one outlier reduced the effect
size to a non-significant g of 0.23 (95% CI 70.001 to 0.46).
Heterogeneity was no longer significant (P40.05).
Depression.
We identified 17 RCTs with 17 comparisons, leading
to a g of 0.43 (95% CI 0.16–0.71). Heterogeneity was high (I 2 =
74.24%) and highly significant. With the removal of two outliers,
the effect size decreased to a g of 0.33 (95% CI 0.16–0.50) and
heterogeneity became non-significant.
Publication bias
We found significant publication bias for general anxiety, social
anxiety and depression. For general anxiety, visual inspection
and Egger’s test indicated an asymmetric funnel plot (intercept
2.95, 95% CI 0.27–5.62, P= 0.031). The Duval & Tweedie trim
and fill procedure did not impute any studies. For social anxiety
inspection of the funnel plot (Fig. 4(b)) and the Duval & Tweedie
trim and fill procedure indicated significant publication bias. After
adjustment for missing studies (n = 3), the effect size decreased
from a g of 0.40 to a non-significant g of 0.14 (95% CI 70.22
to 0.51). Egger’s test was not significant (intercept 4.04, 95% CI
70.39 to 8.48, P= 0.068). For depression inspection of the funnel
plot (Fig. 4(c)) and the Duval & Tweedie trim and fill procedure
indicated significant publication bias. After adjustment for
missing studies (n = 7), the effect size decreased from a g of 0.43
to a non-significant g of 0.09 (95% CI 70.21 to 0.39). Egger’s test
was not significant (intercept 3.25, 95% CI 70.61 to 7.12,
P = 0.09).
Subgroup analyses
The results of subgroup analysis are shown in online Table DS2.
For participant compensation, higher effect sizes were obtained
if participants were compensated, than if they were not, for
anxiety – all measures (P = 0.028), general anxiety (P = 0.054)
and social anxiety (P = 0.001). For sample type, significantly
higher effect sizes were obtained for subclinical or analogue
samples than for clinical ones for social anxiety (P = 0.025). For
recruitment, no significant differences were found. For delivery
type, we found significantly higher effect sizes if the interventions
were delivered exclusively in the laboratory, as opposed to them
including a home-based component for anxiety – all measures
(P = 0.030),
general
anxiety
(P = 0.006)
and
social
anxiety
(P = 0.001). For type of bias, we found significantly higher effect

Main effect sizes for all outcome categories
Anxiety (all measures).
Thirteen RCTs, with 13 comparisons
aggregated to a g of 0.28 (95% CI 0.01–0.55). Heterogeneity was
high (I 2 = 72.76%) and highly significant (Table 2). Removal of
one outlier with an extremely high effect size (g = 2.36) reduced
the effect size by approximately half, to a non-significant g of
0.16 (95% CI 70.03 to 0.35). Heterogeneity remained significant,
but moderate (I 2 = 47.44%).
General anxiety.
Eight RCTs with eight comparisons led to a
non-significant g of 0.29 (95% CI 70.14 to 0.74). Heterogeneity
was high (I 2 = 81.75%) and highly significant. Removal of
one outlier let to a g of 70.01 (95% CI 70.22 to 0.20) and
heterogeneity was no longer significant.
Social anxiety.
Seven RCTs with seven comparisons aggregated
into a non-significant g of 0.32 (95% CI –0.09 to 0.74), with high
heterogeneity (I 2 = 80.84%, Table 2). Removal of one outlier led to
a g of 0.11 (95% CI 70.13 to 0.35) and heterogeneity was no
longer significant.
Depression.
Nine RCTs with nine comparisons aggregated into a
g of 0.24 (95% CI 0.02 to 0.46), with non-significant heterogeneity.
Publication bias
We found evidence of publication bias for general anxiety and
depression. In both cases inspection of the funnel plot and the
Duval & Tweedie trim and fill procedure indicated significant
publication bias. For general anxiety, after adjustment for missing
studies (n = 3), the effect size decreased from a g of 0.29 to a non-
significant g of 70.09 (95% CI 70.58 to 0.40). Egger’s test was
also significant (intercept 6.23, 95% CI 1.32–11.14, P= 0.020).
For depression, after adjustment for missing studies (n = 4), the
effect size decreased from a g of 0.24 to a non-significant g of
0.04 (95% CI 70.20 to 0.29). Egger’s test was also significant
(intercept 3.50, 95% CI 0.69–6.31, P= 0.021). Moreover, for
depression a meta-regression analysis indicated a significant
relationship between publication year and effect size (slope
b = 70.12, 95% CI 70.24 to 70.008, P= 0.036).
Subgroup and mediation analysis
As there were few studies in each outcome category, we did not
conduct subgroup analysis. We inspected which of the included
studies in our meta-analysis had also conducted formal mediation
analysis (i.e. not just correlations) to test whether the effects of the
intervention on emotional outcomes were mediated by changes in
bias. Only 11 out of the 49 RCTs had conducted formal tests of
mediation. Only four studies28,31,63,64 reported clear evidence of
successful mediation. Three other studies found evidence of
mediation for only one, but not for the other outcomes30,40,50
and in two of these, the outcome was physiological40 or
behavioural50 and not the emotional or symptom outcome our
analysis
focused
on.

Discussion
Summary of main findings
We conducted an updated meta-analysis including all CBM
interventions tested in RCTs for clinically relevant outcomes. We
also evaluated, for the first time, the quality of the CBM studies
by assessing the presence of risk of bias. CBM interventions are
ultimately advocated as therapeutic, so we also separately
examined their effects for clinical patients, not just for the blend
of healthy, subclinical and clinical participants that were the focus
of the three previous meta-analyses. Finally, we wanted to analyse
more general moderators of treatment response, relevant to most
psychotherapeutic interventions, and to examine more closely
publication bias and its possible ramifications (for example a
possible effect of time-lag bias).
Overall, for the meta-analysis including all the samples, the
effects of CBM intervention in all outcome categories were small
and showed a high degree of heterogeneity. Exclusion of outliers
significantly reduced effect sizes across all outcome categories, in
some cases by almost half. We note that for anxiety outcomes,
three of the four outliers identified were not only outside the
confidence intervals of the effect size, but had effect sizes almost
ten times higher than the pooled mean effect size. One of
these, Schmidt et al, 2009,56 was identified as an outlier in
two of the three previous meta-analysis.6,7 Ironically, this was
also one of the first articles that marked the ABM research and
practice boom. Adjustment for publication bias also reduced
effect sizes considerably, and for some outcomes rendered them
non-significant.
The only other meta-analysis7 that looked at both ABM and
CBM-I interventions found even smaller, yet significant, results
for both anxiety and depression, respectively, but no evidence of
heterogeneity. We note that many new studies have been published
over the past 3 years, since the search conducted for their meta-
analysis. Whereas they included any controlled clinical trials, we
restricted our meta-analysis to RCTs examining any CBM inter-
vention, which used an established, standardised measure of
symptom or distress-related outcomes.
For clinical samples, the effects of CBM interventions on
anxiety and depression outcomes were small and in most cases
non-significant; in the cases where they were significant, such as
for depression, it seems to have been as a result of the presence
of outliers and/or publication bias. The three previous meta-
analysis6–8 reported either non-significant differences or a trend
towards higher effects for clinical or high symptomatology
samples as compared with unselected ones. Including only RCTs
and looking exclusively at participants with a clinical diagnosis,
our data portray a different picture.
The effects of CBM interventions on types of bias was not
specifically approached in this meta-analysis, as it was analysed
in all three previous meta-analyses. In the studies that measured
bias, this was generally considered just another outcome measure,
alongside emotional and symptom outcomes. Even if mediation
analysis was conducted, it could not reliably indicate that changes
in bias were causally related to changes in symptoms, because they
were both measured at the same time point. Measures of bias were
heterogeneous, employing many different indices and procedure,
not
standardised
and
consequently
difficult
to
interpret.
Moreover, in many cases the task used to measure bias was the
same one used in the intervention (for example the dot probe
task), making it susceptible to the biasing effect of demand
characteristics. Our examination of whether the studies included
examined if the effects of the CBM interventions of emotional
and symptom outcomes was mediated by changes in biases
provided results at best mixed, reflecting the difficulties we
highlighted above. Thus, it is evident we cannot even be sure
which are the mechanisms of change in CBM.
Implications
Given that CBM interventions are primarily intended as cost-
effective therapeutic alternatives,66 alleged to have an impact on
clinically relevant symptoms1, we believe our results cast serious
doubts on the majority of them having strong clinical utility. In
contrast, effect sizes for other forms of psychotherapy have proven
much more robust and of a greater magnitude, even when
compared with a placebo condition. For instance, for adult
depression a meta-analysis67 found a g of 0.51 (corresponding
to an NNTof 3.55) for cognitive–behavioural therapy as compared
with placebo.
Leading
CBM
researchers1
have
argued
that
demand
characteristics are an implausible explanation for CBM findings.
Yet the results of our meta-analysis point in a different direction.
Across anxiety outcome categories, we found that effect sizes were
higher if participants received compensation for participation
than if they did not, and if the intervention was delivered
exclusively in the laboratory as opposed to also including a
home-based component. Moreover, contrary to previous meta-
analyses, our results showed that the effect sizes for general anxiety
and depression were negatively linearly related with the number of
sessions. Although the slope for this relationship is quite small,
albeit significant, and we noted that a considerable proportion
of RCTs included only one session, we can at least conclude that

the lack of reliable effects of CBM is not because of insufficient
exposure to the intervention.
Put together, these results seem to indicate that it is not
unlikely that many positive CBM findings may have been
influenced by a variant of the ‘experimenter effect’67 or other
experimental artefacts, unrelated to the scope and purported
mechanisms of action of these interventions. In support of these
conjectures comes the effect, present in many CBM studies, that
the
placebo
control
group
(‘no
contingency’)
also
shows
improvement.33–35,37,44,51,68 Surprisingly, it has been recently
argued that at least for ABM in the case of social anxiety, the
opposite intervention, assumed to increase bias and used as a
control condition in previous studies, would be more beneficial.35,69
As importantly, we found strong evidence of publication bias,
both for the all samples and the clinical samples meta-analyses.
For the former, there was considerable publication bias for general
anxiety, social anxiety and depression. In fact, for social anxiety
and depression, adjustment for publication bias rendered effect
sizes no longer significant. The same pattern emerged for the
clinical samples meta-analysis. There was strong and consistent
evidence of publication bias for general anxiety and depression.
We also found a strong and consistent negative linear
relationship between publication year and effect size across most
outcome categories: older studies showed significantly higher
effect sizes, whereas more recent studies obtained effect sizes that
were non-significant, very close to zero and, in some cases, even
negative. This is a common phenomenon in intervention research,
when a new intervention is proposed and tested, with the first
studies
showing
large
effects
because
of
methodological
considerations (i.e. the use of pilot, low powered studies where
only large effects can overcome the significance threshold) and a
strong publication bias for positive findings. In fact, promising
new interventions like CBM are very susceptible to a particular
type of publication bias –time lag bias – the phenomenon in
which studies with positive results get to be published first and
dominate the field, until the negative, but equally important, studies
are published70,71 – if they are published at all. Nonetheless, we
suspect this phenomenon was aggravated for CBM by highly
laudatory narrative reviews, comments and editorials, published
before the efficiency of the new interventions had been established
in well-powered, methodologically appropriate RCTs. In addition,
if replication studies are based on high effect sizes found in early
studies, there is a distinct possibility that these subsequent
replication studies are powered to detect a large effect size and
thus are severely underpowered.72 Moreover, overtly positive
pieces about CBM have been almost exclusively published in
top-tier journals, thus contributing to indirectly enforcing the
notion that we were witnessing the development of a powerful
new therapy – ‘a new clinical weapon’.73
Interestingly, CBM-I seems to have better results than ABM.
Although this result seems to suggest differential potential, we
need to be very cautious in its interpretation. Studies on CBM-I
are a newer development and we run the risk of having caught
them exactly in the phase where mostly positive results are
getting published (i.e. time-lag bias). Also, by their nature,
CBM-I interventions are more susceptible to demand characteristics
because it is easier for participants to catch on to a particular
interpretative pattern being favoured.
The view that the praise for CBM is much ahead of its
corresponding empirical evidence is further sustained by results
regarding the quality of the studies. Using a widely accepted and
recommended instrument – the Cochrane Collaboration’s Risk
of bias assessment tool – we showed that the quality of the studies
investigating CBM is substandard. In fact, a significant proportion
of the included studies satisfied no quality criteria at all and about
two-thirds satisfied fewer than three quality criteria. Moreover, it
is even more problematic that for three of the five risk of bias
criteria analysed (sequence generation, allocation concealment,
masking of assessors), a significant proportion of the studies
(ranging from 58 to 83%) was unclear or simply did not contain
information to permit assessment. Even for the masking of
participants, a characteristic asserted as a strong point of these
studies,14 40% were rated as unclear.
Risk of bias can also be associated with artificial inflation of
effect sizes. Indeed, our results showed that for both general
anxiety and depression, the quality of the included RCTs was
negatively related to effect size. The effect size decreased by 0.07
with every quality criterion that was satisfied for general anxiety
and by 0.10 for depression.
Limitations
Given that CBM interventions include a number of different
approaches, under different names and with many task variations,
we might have missed some studies that would have been eligible.
We tried to be inclusive with our search criteria and given that
many CBM studies present themselves as experimental studies
and not RCTs, we conducted our search without restricting it to
RCTs. Statistical power might have also represented a problem,
especially for some subgroup analysis and it might have prevented
us from finding significant differences. There was a very high
degree of heterogeneity for all the outcome categories considered
and one might even wonder if it makes sense to combine these
studies at all.24 However, we underscore that the exclusion of
outliers significantly reduced heterogeneity to non-significant
values
for
all
outcome
categories
considered.
Nonetheless,
confidence
intervals
around
I 2
remained
large,
indicating
heterogeneity was most likely still present. This is probably also
as a result of the fact that CBM studies used a wide range of
outcome measurements, which we were only able to group loosely
into categories. Few studies declared a primary outcome measure.
Future directions
In conclusion, our updated meta-analysis of all types of CBM
interventions examined in RCTs showed small effects for anxiety
and depression outcomes and significant heterogeneity, when all
participant samples were considered. The effects were marked by
significant outliers and publication bias and were largely reduced
when these factors were adjusted. For clinical patients, we showed
small
and
mostly
non-significant
effects
for
anxiety
and
depression outcomes. Adjustment for publication bias rendered
results for all outcome categories non-significant for clinical
patients. The quality of the included RCTs was suboptimal and
higher-quality studies obtained smaller, closer to zero, effect sizes.
More sessions were associated with smaller effect sizes, as were the
absence of participant compensation and the non-exclusively
laboratory-based delivery of the intervention. Along with strong
evidence of publication bias, publication year was a robust
predictor of effect size, across almost all outcome categories: the
more recent the study, the smaller and closer to zero its
corresponding effect size. Our results highlight considerable
problems with CBM interventions, underscoring their lack of
clinically relevant effects for patients, as well as the genuine
possibility of substantial artificial effect size inflation because of
aspects unrelated to the interventions themselves, but to demand
characteristics and publication bias.
Even if, at least recently, CBM researchers have started
acknowledging the ever more frequent negative results and their
significance for CBM interventions, the search for answers
14
 Cognitive bias modification meta-analysis
continues to be confined by the strict boundaries of the paradigm,
with researchers constantly ‘trying out’ new variations of CBM
designs, tasks, instructions, doses (i.e. number of sessions) or
moderating
variables
to
attempt
to
validate
a
theoretical
framework. We argue that this approach is detrimental, as it
hinders the development of well-conducted, independently run
RCTs. Unlike other forms of psychotherapy, not only is there no
established protocol for CBM interventions, but it becomes
difficult to choose from the wide variety of task variations and
dosages proposed.
We believe that the only way of creating a more robust CBM is
by replacing the myriad of experimental variations with proper
clinical research (i.e. on clinical patients with a randomised trial
design, a pre-specified, reproducible protocol, sufficient power)
on the most promising CBM approaches (for instance AAT for
alcohol problems). One CBM approach that has done that is
CNT,74,75 which now requires independent validation from other
investigator groups in order to be considered an evidence-based
treatment for depression. Only if such studies are conducted
