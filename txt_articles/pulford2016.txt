Summary
Vasculogenic mimicry, the process in which cancer cells
form angiomatoid structures independent of or in addition to
host angiogenesis has been recorded in several otherwise
non-endothelial malignant neoplasms.
This study de-
scribes evidence of routine vascular mimicry by human
mesothelioma cell lines in vitro, when the cell lines are
cultured alone or co-cultured with human umbilical vascular
endothelial cells, with the formation of angiomatoid tubular
networks. Vasculogenic mimicry is also supported by
immunohistochemical
demonstration
of
human-specific
anti-mitochondria antibody labelling of tumour-associated
vasculature
of
human
mesothelioma
cells
xeno-
transplanted into nude mice, and by evidence of vascular
mimicry in some biopsy samples of human malignant me-
sotheliomas. These studies show mosaic interlacing of
cells that co-label or label individually for immunohisto-
chemical markers of endothelial and mesothelial differen-
tiation. If vascular
mimicry in mesothelioma
can
be
characterised more fully, this may facilitate identification of
more specific and targeted therapeutic approaches such as
anti-angiogenesis in combination with chemotherapy and
immunotherapy or other therapeutic approaches.
Key words: Mesothelioma; vasculogenic mimicry; angiogenesis; VEGF;

INTRODUCTION
Malignant mesothelioma (MM) is an aggressive malignancy
of the serosal membranes lining the pleural, peritoneal and
pericardial cavities. Most MMs are attributable to asbestos
exposure. Although there are now bans on asbestos in most
industrialised countries, the incidence of pleural MM is stable
or even increasing, due to long latency between commence-
ment of exposure and diagnosis, and the continued presence
of asbestos in the built environment.1–3 Prognosis remains
poor, with median survivals of about 12 months, highlighting
the importance of novel treatment strategies.4
Adequate blood supply is essential for tumour growth,
invasion and metastasis.5 In mesothelioma, microvessel den-
sity is independently associated with decreased survival,5–7
and high levels of VEGF-A in serum and pleural effusions
are adverse prognostic factors.8,9 Traditionally, tumour
vascularisation was thought to occur via angiogenesis by the
sprouting of pre-existing host blood vessels to form new
vascular channels, but tumour angiogenesis is now thought to
involve alternative mechanisms of vascularisation including
vasculogenic mimicry (VM). First described in aggressive
uveal melanomas,10 some tumour cells re-differentiate to an
endothelium-like phenotype to form hollow channels and
narrow conduits with a lumen through which blood can
flow.11–15 VM has been observed in other tumours,16–23
sometimes associated with decreased survival.19 The occur-
rence and significance of VM in MM has yet to be evaluated
although there exists one report of VM in ‘mesothelial
sarcomas’.24
In solid tumours, angiogenesis is stimulated by pro-
angiogenic factors in response to hypoxia in the tumour
microenvironment. Members of the VEGF family are
important regulators of angiogenesis.8,9,25,26 There are several
VEGF isoforms.27 VEGF-A and VEGF-B act via their re-
ceptors VEGFR1 (Flt-1) and VEGFR2 (Flk-1/KDR).28 MMs
secrete VEGF-A and can express VEGFR1, and in some MM
cell lines VEGF-A acts directly as an autocrine growth factor
in vitro, in a dose-dependent manner.29 This effect may be
dependent on expression of VEGFR1.30 Our observations
suggest that although classical pathways of angiogenesis
contribute to disease progression in MM, alternative mecha-
nisms of cancer progression such as VM may be significant.
MM is a morphologically protean tumour with epithelial,
biphasic
and
sarcomatoid
histological
subtypes31–34
and, occasionally, heterologous sarcomatous differentiation
such as chondroid and osseous differentiation.35 MMs
routinely co-express epithelial and mesenchymal markers,
such as cytokeratins and thrombomodulin, a glycoprotein
expressed by mesothelium, vascular endothelium, synovium
and placental syncytiotrophoblast.32,36–40 Sarcomatoid fea-
tures predict poor prognosis, and the morphology-based MM
classification correlates with expression profiles of molecular
markers of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT).41,42
Based on our clinical observations that rare MMs express
specific vascular endothelial markers such as CD31 while
maintaining cytokeratin expression and positive expression
of mesothelial markers, and coupled with the limited clinical
response to anti-angiogenic therapies, we postulated that MM
is capable of VM.

 MATERIALS AND METHODS
Mesothelioma cell cultures
NCI-H226, NCI-H28, NCI-H2052, NCI-2452, MSTO-211H and Met5a cell
lines were obtained from the ATCC and used within 20 passages. All cell
lines were maintained in complete DMEM (10% fetal calf serum, 50 U/mL
penicillin, and 50 mg/mL streptomycin) and incubated at 37�C at 5% CO2.
Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) used as positive controls
for tube formation assays were obtained from consenting donors43 (approved
by the Human Research Ethics Committee of the Royal Adelaide Hospital,
Adelaide, South Australia); HUVECs were cultured in M199 media supple-
mented with 20% FCS, 50 U/mL penicillin, 50 mg/mL streptomycin, 1 mM
sodium pyruvate, 1% v/v non-essential amino acids and 1% v/v GlutaMAX.
Harvesting of primary MM cells from pleural effusion fluids
Twelve MM pleural effusion samples (with corresponding confirmatory bi-
opsies), originating from eight patients (6 male, 2 female; 7 epithelioid and 1
sarcomatoid MM) were tested after diagnostic procedures were finalised
(approved by Southern Adelaide Clinical Human Research Ethics Commit-
tee). Four benign reactive effusions were also tested. Samples were centri-
fuged at 500 × g for 10 min at 25�C, and the cell pellet was cultured in
complete DMEM. Supernatants were stored at −80�C. Purity of samples
(>80%) was confirmed by positive immunohistochemistry for the mesothelial
cell marker calretinin and with the epithelial antibody CAM5.2. Diagnosis of
corresponding biopsies was confirmed as above.
Tube formation assay
Ibidi mslide angiogenesis slides (Ibidi, Germany) were coated with 10 mL
growth factor nutrient-reduced Matrigel (BD Biosciences, USA), and allowed
to polymerase for 30 min at 37�C. Cells were seeded in triplicate (1.6 × 105
cells/well) in complete DMEM and incubated at 37�C. For MM and HUVEC
co-culture, 8 × 105 cells from each cell type were combined and subsequently
seeded at 1.6 × 105 cells/well onto Matrigel. Photos were taken at 1 h and 6 h
on an Olympus IX71 Fluorescence Inverted Microscope (Olympus, Japan),
and ‘stitched’ together using Adobe Photoshop (Adobe, USA).
Immunofluorescent staining of tube formation assays
Cultures were washed twice with PBS, and fixed for 30 min at 25�C with 10%
buffered formalin. Blocking was performed using 10% normal goat serum for
90 min, followed by addition of 1:100 primary antibody (Calretinin, 18-0211,
Zymed, USA; CD31, JC/70A, M0823, Dako, Denmark) in 10% normal goat
serum. After 2 h incubation, wells were washed and incubated with secondary
antibody for 2 h. Nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst 33342 (Bio-Rad,
USA) for 30 min at 25�C, then cells were washed and visualised with an
Olympus IX71 Fluorescence Inverted Microscope.
Animal model
A heterotopic xenograft mouse model of MM was used to evaluate the origin
of the vasculature in MM. Briefly, 1 × 106 NCI-H226 cells in PBS were
injected subcutaneously into the hind flank of BALB/C nude mice (n = 6).
Tumours were grown to 100 mm3 and animals euthanised by CO2 exposure
(approved by Flinders University and Southern Adelaide Local Health
Network Animal Welfare Committee).
Immunohistochemistry
All diagnostic immunohistochemical studies were performed by a clinical
laboratory participating in a quality assurance program (QAP), using National
Association of Testing Authorities (NATA)-approved procedures and with
appropriate controls. For cell block preparation from cultured cells and ef-
fusions, cell pellets were resuspended in 1–2 drops of sheep plasma. One drop
of thrombin was added and the mixture was allowed to set before immersion
in 10% formalin. Graded concentrations of ethanol and isopropanol were
applied before embedding in paraffin. Paraffin sections were cut at 4 mm,
deparaffinised and quenched with 1% H2O2. Cell block sections originating
from cultured cells then underwent immunohistochemistry under the same
conditions as clinical samples. For the human mitochondria immunohisto-
chemistry, sections underwent EDTA retrieval and block with 10% normal
goat serum (Sigma), before overnight incubation with 1:750 primary antibody
MAB1273B (clone 113-1; Merck Millipore, USA).
Human MM biopsy diagnosis
Of the five biopsy cases reported in this study, two were identified among 18
in-house MMs of any histological subtype investigated at the Flinders
Medical Centre (FMC) over a 15-month interval in 2015–2016; three cases
represented referrals among a greater number of cases for most of which no
paraffin embedded tissue was received. Diagnosis was established by light
microscopy and positive immunohistochemical (IHC) labelling for epithelioid
MM markers (CK5/6, calretinin, WT1, D2-40, thrombomodulin and HBME-
1),32,44 to exclude an epithelioid haemangioendothelioma (EHE) or an
epithelioid angiosarcoma (ASa),45–47 supplemented by radiological demon-
stration that the tumour was serosa-based (pleural or, in one case, peritoneal),
with no imaging evidence of any extraserosal tumour.32,34 One referred
biopsy case was also studied by immunohistochemistry for glycophorin A as
a marker for erythrocyte cell membranes.48 Another referral case was
immunolabelled for TLE-1 (Transducin-like enhancer of split-1) and Eryth-
roblast transformation specific related gene product (ERG; a marker for
endothelial cells and some prostatic carcinomas49,50). Although TLE-1
labelling is demonstrable in about 90% of synovial sarcomas or more, it is
also recorded in benign schwannian and solitary fibrous tumours, and up to
about 37% of non-synovial sarcomas that include malignant peripheral nerve
sheath cell tumours.51–53 Matsuyama et al.54 found TLE-1 expression in
>25% of cells in 20 of 29 mesotheliomas of all histological subtypes (about
69%), and those authors54 concluded that TLE-1 expression had no or only
limited value in the distinction between mesothelioma and synovial sarcoma.
Some ‘early’ papers on VM included staining with periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)
(plus CD31 immunohistochemistry10) or immunohistochemistry for laminin;
however, PAS can stain epithelial, mesothelial55 or vascular basement
membranes, and the same consideration applies to laminin immunohisto-
chemistry, so that such markers do not per se distinguish between mesothelial
and endothelial differentiation.56 Therefore, we have concentrated on CD31
positivity in combination with strong cytokeratin expression and mesothelial
cell markers in step sections of the same areas of the same mesotheliomas.
RESULTS
Mesothelioma cell lines and MM primary cells form
tube-like interconnected networks in vitro under
permissive conditions
All MM cell lines tested (NCI-H226, NCI-H28, NCI-H2052,
NCI-2452 and MSTO-211H) formed tube-like structures
after 6 h incubation in vitro (Fig. 1B–F) when cultured on
reconstituted basement membrane (Matrigel) without growth
factors. Likewise, all 12 primary MM cell samples obtained
from pleural effusion fluids showed tube formation (Fig. 1G,
representative of the seven epithelioid MMs tested; Fig. 1H
the single sarcomatoid MM). The tubes formed by the MM
cells were comparable to positive control tubes formed by
bona fide vascular cells, HUVECs, under the same conditions
(Fig. 1I). In contrast, mesothelial cells obtained from reactive
effusions and the normal mesothelial Met5a cell line
(Fig. 1A) did not form these networks under the same con-
ditions. The tube-like structures did not label for CD31.
Calretinin and cytokeratin expression were maintained in the
cultured cells, including the single sarcomatoid MM.
Mesothelioma primary cells and HUVECs form
interconnected networks in vitro
Primary MM cells incubated together with HUVECs formed
interconnected networks consisting of both cell types,
indicated by labelling of the mesothelial component for
calretinin. There were no isolated islands of either cell
type present, suggesting that vascular endothelial cells and
MM tumour cells are capable of forming vascular mosaic
networks (Fig. 1J).

culture of HUVECs and MM, cells were labelled in situ with the anti-mesothelial antibody calretinin (red), and counterstained with Hoechst (blue). Photos were taken
using an Olympus IX71 inverted fluorescence microscope fitted with 4× objective. The vasculogenic mimicry potential of MM cell lines was comparable to that of
HUVECs, in contrast to the benign control cell line Met5a which did not exhibit tube formation under the same conditions. Co-cultured HUVEC and MM formed tube-
like structures consisting of a mosaic of both cell types. (A) Met5a showing absence of tubal networks. (B) NCI-H28. (C) NCI-H226. (D) NCI-H2052. (E) NCI-H2452.

 The vasculature in a heterotopic MM xenograft model
is partially of human origin
Immunohistochemistry for human-specific mitochondria in
sections of heterotopic xenografted MM in BALB/C nude
mice confirmed that some vessels were of mouse origin,
being lined with mouse endothelial cells, but labelling with
the
human
mitochondria-specific
antibody
MAB1273B
showed labelling of cells lining vessels containing red
blood cells at the periphery of the tumour,57 indicative of
VM in vivo (Fig. 2). Labelling for CD31 was apparent in all
vascular structures, irrespective of human or mouse origin.
Some biopsies of human MMs show clinical evidence of
vascular mimicry
As depicted in Fig. 3–6 and discussed in the corresponding
legends, we found that in some biopsy samples of MMs,
some cytokeratin-positive spindle and/or epithelioid cells
formed vascular channels containing red blood cells, and the
cells participating in vessel formation showed co-labelling for
CD31 and cytokeratins, suggesting that VM is a significant
feature in some MMs.
DISCUSSION
It was long thought that the microvasculature in malignant
neoplasms represents proliferation of host micro-vessels
driven by the secretion of angiogenic factors by the
neoplastic cell population. A more complex picture has now
emerged, beginning with the first report on VM by Maniotis
et al.10 in 1999. VM has now been recorded in a variety of
human malignant neoplasms, including uveal and cutaneous
melanoma,22 some breast carcinomas,20,58 hepatocellular
carcinoma,21,23 gastric adenocarcinoma16 and, especially,
glioblastoma.59–68 In this study, we adduce multifactorial
evidence for VM (‘angioblastic differentiation’) in human
MM, as demonstrated by: (1) the findings of 3-dimensional
tubular networks of human MM cells in vitro, including all
of the standard commercially available MM cell lines tested
and 12 separate samples of primary MM cells harvested
from pleural effusion fluids in biopsy-proven cases of MM,
although no such networks were identified in cultures of
benign
reactive
mesothelial
cells;
(2)
the
differential
expression of a human mitochondrial marker in vascular
structures when a standard human MM cell line (NCI-
H226) was xenotransplanted into a nude mouse; and (3) a
few conventional biopsy samples of human MM, although
VM seems to be unrecognisable in most ‘routine’ biopsy
cases.
It is important to note in this context that the formation of
interconnecting networks occurred spontaneously when MM
cells were cultured on reconstituted basement membrane
(Matrigel) without growth factors, i.e., without added VEGF.
Unlike conventional culture, this matrix simply allows three-
dimensional structures to form, but does not contain pro-
angiogenic growth factors. However, MM cells themselves
can secrete VEGF. It is unlikely that VM in MM coincides
with epithelial to mesenchymal transition41 (previously
shown to correlate with sarcomatoid change), because all
primary MM cells tested were capable of VM in vitro, and
only one sample was sarcomatoid in type (sarcomatoid MMs
are notoriously paucicellular in effusion fluid). Rather, this
may be an expression of the known pluripotency of meso-
thelial cells. This suggests that the positive labelling of
tumour cells for endothelial markers in the biopsies repre-
sents an ‘extreme’ degree of endothelial differentiation in
recognisable tumour cells, whereas in the majority of cases,
those cells that have transitioned to vascular structures are
simply not recognised as being neoplastic in character. The
presence of human-derived vessels in a standard heterotopic
xenograft MM model, where a MM tumour cell line (i.e., no
possible contamination by human vascular cells) was injected
also supports the notion that this may not be uncommon in
MM. The labelling of all vessels for CD31 in the animal
model also suggests that in biopsy samples VM may easily be
overlooked, unless non-vascular tumour cells also express
CD31. Labelling for CD31 is not necessary for MM cells to
acquire a vascular phenotype, because the tube-like forma-
tions in vitro did not label for CD31.
The majority (67–93%) of human MM samples label for
thrombomodulin as well as cytokeratins,32,36–40 and this may
be an indication of the ability to differentiate into vascular
structures. Rare MMs also show labelling of tumour cells for
CD31,69 and as discussed above, it is impossible to ascertain
by CD31 labelling alone whether vessels are of tumour cell
origin or stromal-derived microvasculature. Two ‘conven-
tional’ mesothelial markers—thrombomodulin (CD141) and
D2-40—are also endothelial markers,39,70,71 suggesting
some plasticity in differentiation. There has been a previous
report of vasculogenic mimicry in ‘mesothelial sarcomas’24
but this is not standard nomenclature, and that study did
not specify the criteria used to make that diagnosis.24
Clearly, a major differential diagnostic consideration in
the biopsy cases that we illustrate is MM with VM versus

mitochondria only (brown staining). (A) Vessel containing blood cells within the middle of the tumour is lined by mouse endothelial cells, unlabelled with MAB1273B.

 pseudomesotheliomatous ASa72 or EHE.72 Serosal endothe-
lial sarcomas are rare and reported cases of pleural ASa were
defined by positive labelling for endothelial markers45,72–74
and negative mesothelial markers.45,47 Some reports on
serosal ASa/EHE do not include any data on labelling for
mesothelial markers;45,73–76 two other publications recorded
a negative result for the only mesothelial marker used,
namely calretinin46 or HBME-1.45 Labelling for vimentin
and cytokeratins may not reliably discriminate between MM
and endothelial sarcomas.45 For these reasons, we have used
multiple (six) MM markers—CK5/6, calretinin, WT1, D2-
40, HBME-1 and thrombomodulin—and we have sought

 multifactorial evidence for VM in MM (i.e., cell culture of
MM, and human mitochondrial immunohistochemistry in a
MM xenograft). We consider those five clinical tumours to
represent MM, based on co-expression of multiple meso-
thelial markers, areas of tubulopapillary architecture, and
spindle-cell sarcomatoid areas in some tumours. The concept
that MM can show specific patterns of mesenchymal differ-
entiation (including heterologous sarcomatoid differentia-
tion) may in part explain the readiness for differentiation as
vessels under permissive conditions in vitro. The known
pluripotency of normal mesothelial cells has resulted in their
use for tissue engineering, including replacement of neural-
crest derived corneal endothelium.77 Our study has found
that evidence of vascular differentiation in biopsies of MM
varies greatly and Attanoos et al.73 found no CD31 expres-
sion in 92 mesotheliomas investigated, but all primary MM
cells tested as part of our study were capable of VM in vitro.
Terada et al.78 suggested their case of pericardial ASa might
have represented a peculiar MM with abnormal differentia-
tion along an angioblastic pathway, and in 2012 Klabatsa
et al.69 reported a diffuse pleural mesothelioma with epithe-
lioid and angiosarcomatous components, which may corre-
spond to our clinical cases: angioblastic differentiation may
be analogous to heterologous osteochondroid differentiation
in the sarcomatoid component of some MMs.35 Although
CD31 can label macrophages, we consider the co-labelling
for
cytokeratins
(and
other
more
specific
mesothelial
markers in step sections the same cell clusters in our biopsy
cases and labelling for ERG in one case) negates this
explanation for the CD31 positivity.
We consider that VM is a property of MM: we are unable
to estimate with any reasonable degree of precision the pro-
portion of MMs that display immunohistochemical evidence
of VM in the form of CD31 expression in human biopsy

positive labelling with/for vimentin, AE1/AE3, CAM5.2 and CK7, but CK20 was negative. There was positive labelling for the mesothelial markers calretinin (focal),
WT1 (focal), and thrombomodulin, as well as smooth muscle actin, and there was strong positive labelling for CD31, together with much weaker labelling for CD34 and
factor VIII-related antigen. The label for BAP1 was positive. The preparation for Stat 6 was negative. The slides were reviewed by an expert in soft tissue tumour

 tissue (perhaps because it is unrecognisable as such in most
biopsy samples), but the in vitro findings in our study point to
VM as a routine occurrence in MM, with the capacity for
anastomosis/mosaicism with host vasculature (Fig. 7), and
VM was detectable not only in our MMs with sarcomatoid
differentiation, but also in epithelioid MMs. We consider that
CD31 labelling in otherwise typical MM samples may simply
be an IHC marker for hybrid mesothelial / endothelial
differentiation that is part of the pluripotency of MM (with
epithelial to mesenchymal transition). Such EMT is at least
latent in up to about 50% or more of epithelioid mesotheli-
omas, and it occurs in about 75% of biphasic MMs and about
85% of sarcomatoid MMs,79 as demonstrated by vimentin-
cytokeratin co-synthesis: in their study of 326 sarcomatoid
and desmoplastic MMs, Klebe et al.80 detected vimentin
expression in 101/111 cases (91%), cytokeratins in 161/
280 (93%) and calretinin expression in 12/39 cases (31%).
Alpha-smooth muscle actin (SMA) and desmin expression
is detectable by immunohistochemistry in about 10% of
biphasic MMs (and in a greater proportion of reactive
mesothelial hyperplasias, up to about 85%).79,81 The exact
mechanisms for such EMT in MM appear to be complex
and are incompletely understood. Fassina et al.41 studied
N-cadherin, vimentin, SMA, Snail, Slug, Twist, ZEB1,
ZEB2, S100A4, MMP2, and MMP9 from epithelioid to
biphasic and sarcomatoid MM cell lines by immunohisto-
chemistry and qRT-PCR, and in situ hybridisation. They
found ectopic expression of miR-205 (a repressor of ZEB1
and ZEB2 expression) in a commercially available meso-
thelial cell line and in epithelioid and biphasic MM cell lines
and it induced a significant reduction of ZEB1 and ZEB2,
with inhibition of migration and invasion. In particular, miR-
205 was significantly down-regulated in biphasic and sarco-
matoid MMs, correlating with a mesenchymal phenotype and
more aggressive behaviour. De Reynies et al.42 investigated
38 primary pleural MM cell cultures by transcriptomic
microarrays (discovery + extension series; n = 67), and 108
frozen pleural MMs by qRT-PCR for gene mutations that
included BAP1, CDKN2A, CDKN2B, NF2 and TP53; EMT
markers were studied at mRNA and proteonomic levels.
From these studies they divided their MMs into two groups:
C1 and C2. All sarcomatoid/desmoplastic MMs fell into C2,

 whereas the epithelioid and biphasic MMs fell into both C1
and C2, partly correlating with histological subtyping. Genes
up-regulated during EMT (such as the adhesion molecules
POSTN and VCAN or the transcription factors SANI2, TCF4
and HMGA2) showed higher expression in C2 than C1,
whereas genes down-regulated during EMT such as CDH1
and CDH3 showed lower expression in C2 than C1. The
prognosis for C2 was worse than for C1. In a further pro-
spective study of VM in MMs, we hope to explore further the
EMT pathways implicated in MMs with VM, by immuno-
histochemistry, and proteonomic and metabolomic analysis,
together with studies for cancer stem cells in MM.

The mechanisms of conventional angiogenesis, with endothelial-lined
vessels supplying the growing tumour with blood. In contrast, in vascular
mimicry, tumour cells arrange themselves to form a lumen that can carry blood,
and assume some endothelial characteristics. These vessels could link into pre-
existing conventional vasculature, or alternatively, mosaic vessels that are lined
by a mixture of tumour cells and endothelial cells could be formed.

Biopsies from a 63-year-old woman with a history of past occupational exposure to asbestos. She presented with a 100 mm mass lesion in the right anterosuperior
mediastinum with evidence of chest wall invasion, accompanied by erosion of the second rib. Diagnoses of synovial sarcoma and leiomyosarcoma were considered [the
tumour labelled for TLE-154 but FISH for t(X;18) was negative]. Two biopsies were taken. The tumour in the second biopsy labelled with/for AE1/AE3 and CK5/6
(weak), D2-40, WT1 and HBME-1. Labelling was also observed for CD31 and another endothelial marker, ERG. A final diagnosis of mesothelioma was favoured and
together the two biopsies showed a biphasic malignant MM, with desmoplastic features in the first biopsy (A). (B–E) Step sections from the same area of the second
biopsy. (B) Calretinin labelling. (C) Weak labelling for CK5/6. (D) D2-40 positive labelling of tumour cells. (E) CD31 positive labelling of small blood vessels and in a
linear pattern around tumour cells. (F) Labelling for ERG, in host blood vessels and with weaker labelling of tumour cell nuclei (arrows).
