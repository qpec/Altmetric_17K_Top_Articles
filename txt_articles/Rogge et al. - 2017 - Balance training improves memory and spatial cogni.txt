Physical exercise has been shown to improve cognitive functions. However, it is still unknown which 
type of exercise affects cognition. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that a demanding 
balance training program improves memory and spatial cognition. Forty healthy participants aged 
19–65 years were randomly assigned to either a balance or relaxation training intervention. Each group 
exercised twice a week for a total of 12 weeks. Pre- and posttests assessed balance performance, 
cardiorespiratory fitness, memory, spatial cognition, and executive functions. Only the balance group 
significantly increased in balance performance from pre- to posttest, while cardiorespiratory fitness 
remained unchanged in both groups. Moreover, the balance group significantly improved in memory 
and spatial cognition. Effects on executive functions were not observed. These results suggest that 
balance training is capable of improving particularly memory and spatial cognition. Therefore, an 
increase in cardiorespiratory fitness does not seem to be necessary to induce beneficial effects of 
physical exercise on cognition. It might be speculated that stimulating the vestibular system during 
balance training induces changes of the hippocampus and parietal cortex possibly via direct pathways 
between the vestibular system and these brain regions.
Developing methods to enhance neuroplasticity and cognitive functioning has become a major research interest of 
psychologists in the light of quickly advancing technologies and aging societies1. Among a large variety of behavio-
ral interventions such as cognitive training programs and special nutrition, physical exercise programs have been 
suggested to improve cognition2, 3. Physical exercise over a course of several months has been shown to improve 
cognitive performance, including executive functions4, 5, speed of processing6, and memory7. Moreover, aerobic 
exercise has been found to slow down gray matter volume loss in the hippocampus and frontal lobes8. So far, most 
of the studies investigating the effects of physical exercise on cognitive functions have focused on aerobic training 
like running, walking and cycling. However, a recent meta-analysis on the effects of aerobic training on cognitive 
functions in older adults concluded that there is still no clear evidence for a causal link between an increase in car-
diorespiratory fitness and cognitive benefits9. Thus, cardiorespiratory fitness improvements following aerobic train-
ing might only be one of multiple factors mediating the positive effects of exercise on cognition. This hypothesis is 
supported by recent reports suggesting beneficial effects of other types of exercise on cognitive functions. For exam-
ple, randomized controlled intervention studies employing coordination training5, 10 and dancing11 reported pos-
itive effects on memory, selective attention, executive functions and spatial cognition compared to control groups.
Physical exercise, regardless of its aerobic or anaerobic metabolic demands, provides a stimulus to vestibu-
lar, neuromuscular and proprioceptive systems. The perception of self-motion and balance is coded by vestibular 
detection of inertial motion, in conjunction with proprioceptive and visual signals12. Connections between vestibu-
lar nuclei and the cerebellum, hippocampus, as well as prefrontal and parietal cortices provide information for cog-
nitive functions such as spatial functions, navigation and memory13, 14. For example, bilateral vestibular lesions were 
found to result in decreased performance in spatial memory tasks15, hippocampal atrophy16, and reduced fractional 
anisotropy in white matter tracts within the limbic system and the thalamus17. Caloric stimulation of the vestibular 
nuclei in healthy adults, on the other hand, improved verbal and spatial memory18 and Galvanic vestibular stimu-
lation modulated mental rotation and perspective taking abilities, depending on the threshold of the current19, 20.

It has been speculated that an increased stimulation of the vestibular system during self-motion might be an 
essential mediator between physical exercise and cognitive functioning21. Accordingly, animal studies have shown 
that improved balance performance resulted in higher survival rates of neurons22 and increased volume of the 
hippocampus and prefrontal areas23. In humans, balance skills have been associated with an increased volume of 
the hippocampus24, the basal ganglia25, and frontal and parietal brain areas26. However, data on the effects of bal-
ance training on cognitive functions, particularly related to memory and spatial cognition, are rare so far. A recent 
study in young adults found improvements in a spatial orientation task after one month of balance training27, 
compared to a passive control group.
The goal of the present study was to test the hypothesis that a physical exercise program with high demands 
on the vestibular system improves particularly memory and spatial cognition. To this end, we implemented a 
demanding balance training program in healthy adults in comparison to a relaxation training intervention. Both 
training types were expected to not affect cardiorespiratory fitness. Memory, spatial cognition and executive 
functions were assessed before and after the 12-week training program.
Methods
Participants. 
A total of 70 healthy participants were recruited via public advertisements in the city of 
Hamburg (Germany). Participants between the age of 18 and 65 years were included if they reported sport activi-
ties of no more than five times a month during the last five years and no extensive experience in balance or relax-
ation training. All participants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision and normal hearing abilities. Exclusion 
criteria were untreated heart diseases, untreated respiratory diseases, neurological or psychiatric illnesses, acute 
musculoskeletal diseases or arthropathies. Additionally, participants underwent a sport medical examination. 
Based on meta-analysis of previous exercise-cognition studies28 we expected a medium effect size. Such an effect 
size can be statistically detected in a Time ×
 Group design with a total sample size of 34 participants (power 0.80, 
alpha 0.05). A total of 40 participants successfully completed the study (for details, see Fig. 1). Dropout cases 
during the intervention are included in the participants’ characteristics at pretest to show that dropouts were not 
significantly different from participants completing the training (see Table 1).
Participants received a monetarily compensation of 130–156 € for participation, depending on the duration 
of the assessments. The study was approved by the ethical board of the German Psychological Society (DGPs) 
and carried out in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration guidelines. All participants gave written informed 
consent.
Design. 
Participants were grouped into matched pairs based on age, gender and years of education. 
Participants of each pair were randomly assigned to the balance or the relaxation group. Each participant under-
went three testing sessions prior and after the intervention. The test battery included balance tests, a cardiores-
piratory fitness assessment, cognitive tests, as well as questionnaires on physical activity and psychopathological 
symptoms. All test assessors were blinded to the participant’s group assignment and participants were naïve to 
the study hypothesis.
Intervention. 
Participants trained twice a week for 12 weeks in groups of 10–12 individuals, with each ses-
sion lasting for 50 minutes. Both training groups were instructed by the same professional trainers. Each partic-
ipant was supposed to take part in 24 training sessions. The training was offered for a total of 13 weeks, so that 
participants could catch up missed training sessions. All participants were advised not to change their habitual 
level of physical activity throughout the intervention period.

Balance training. Participants conducted a balance circuit training on varying surfaces, either on one leg or 
on both legs. They had to complete eight different balance stations per session, each lasting for 5 minutes. The 
training favored a situational approach: Tasks were designed to induce reactive postural adjustments, forcing 
participants to permanently re-stabilize. For example, one task was to keep balance in a single-leg stance while 
being consistently pulled to one side with a strong elastic strap around the hips. On half of the stations, working 
in tandems was required. For example, participants were standing on a wobble board, throwing a medicine ball to 
their partner and back while trying to regain balance. Exercises were progressively adjustable to the skill level of 
the participants by combining and increasing the difficulty of the balance components, i.e. by increasing the strap 
tension, the distance to the partner, or by closing the eyes while standing on one leg on a soft surface. No explicit 
strategies were taught. After six weeks, exercises were replaced with a new set, in order to keep the training inter-
esting and sufficiently challenging.
Relaxation training. The relaxation group practiced two well-known relaxation techniques: Progressive muscle 
relaxation29 and autogenic training30. Participants were laying or sitting on mats. They were instructed to practice 
relaxation approaches by actively increasing and decreasing muscle tension of single body parts (progressive 
muscle relaxation) or by concentrating on the rhythm and depth of breathing (autogenic training). During the 
first half of the training period, progressive muscle relaxation was taught, and after six weeks, autogenic training 
was introduced to keep the participants’ motivation and attention high.
Both training groups were comparable with regard to duration, place, social contacts, group size and concen-
tration on the body, yet only the experimental group received active balance training.
Assessments. 
Physical assessments. Balance: To assess dynamic, functional and static balance parameters 
prior to and after the intervention, three different tests were used.
 (1) Dynamic balance was assessed with a stability platform (Stability Platform, Modell 16030 L, Lafayette 
Instrument Company, Lafayette, IN, USA). Participants stood barefoot on an unstable platform with a 
maximum deviation of 15° to each side of its horizontal alignment. They were asked to keep the platform 
in a horizontal position for 30 sec. A handrail was available to prevent falls, but during a trial participants 
placed their hands on their hips. After a one-minute practice trial, three trials per condition (eyes open and 
eyes closed) were conducted with rests of 30 sec in-between. Whether participants started with eyes open 
or with eyes closed was counter-balanced across participants. The test score was calculated as the mean 
time across trials the platform was in the horizontal position (±3° deviation).
 (2) To measure functional balance, the Balance Error Scoring System (BESS31 was used. Participants were 
tested barefoot with eyes closed using three different stances: double-leg stance (feet parallel to each 
other), single-leg stance (standing on the non-dominant leg) and a semi-tandem stance (non-domi-
nant foot behind the dominant foot, heel-to-toe joint). During all trials, participants were instructed 
to stand as motionless as possible with their hands resting on their hips. The underground was either 
a firm surface or a 10 cm flat cushion of medium density foam (Airex® Balance-Pad, Gaugler & Lutz 
oHG, Germany). Following the BESS protocol, each position was tested twice on each underground; 
each trial lasted for 20 sec. Participants were video-recorded and two trained observers independently 
scored errors using a standardized rating scale. Error categories included opening eyes, lifting hands 
off the hips, stepping, stumbling or falling out of the position, lifting the forefoot or heel, abducting 
the hip by more than 30°, or failing to return to the starting position within 5 sec. To determine relia-
bility, intraclass correlations (ICC) were calculated, ranging from r = 0.86 to r = 0.93 for each position 
and underground. For the overall score, the number of errors was summed up for each position and 
underground, but separately for the two repetitions. The mean of the two sums was used as the de-
pendent variable.

 (3) A force plate (Type 9260AA6, Kistler® Instrumente GmbH, Switzerland) was used to assess postural sway 
velocity. For this, center of pressure data were collected during double leg, single leg and tandem leg stanc-
es, using the software BioWare (Kistler Instruments AG, version 4.0.1.2). Each position was tested three 
times with eyes closed and three times with eyes open. The order of eyes open/closed conditions was ran-
domized across participants. Trials lasted 30 sec each; the last 20 sec of each trial were used for the analyses 
to avoid initial motion biases. A lowpass butterworth-filter implemented in MATLAB (The MathWorks 
Inc., USA) was used to preprocess the data. The sway velocity of the center of pressure (CoP) was deter-
mined by dividing the cumulative of medial–lateral and anterior–posterior CoP displacement by the trial 
time. The overall CoP score was calculated as the mean of the three trials per position, condition and sway 
axes (medial - lateral; anterior - posterior). Because the single-leg position was too difficult for most of the 
participants, only double leg and tandem-leg stances were included in the main score.
Cardiorespiratory fitness: Cardiorespiratory fitness was assessed by a graded maximal ergospirome-
try. Participants started on a cycle ergometer (ER 900, ergoline GmbH, Germany) with an initial workload of 
50 Watt. The resistance was gradually increased, adding 50/3 Watt each minute. This procedure was continued 
until the subjectively perceived maximum exhaustion of the participant was reached. During the ergospirometry, 
oxygen uptake (COSMED, REF C09073-02-99), heart rate (CardioPart 12 Blue, Amedtec GmbH, Germany), 
capillary blood lactate (BIOSEN, EKF diagnostics GmbH, Germany), and blood pressure were monitored. 
Cardiorespiratory fitness was defined as the maximum oxygen uptake (ml/min) at exhaustion divided by body 
weight, hereinafter referred to as VO2peak (ml/min/kg).
Cognitive assessment. Memory: An auditory verbal paired-associate learning task was used to assess memory32. 
Twenty Polish-German word pairs (10 nouns and 10 verbs) were presented via speakers (Bose Companion 2 
series II). The stimuli were recorded from female native speakers. The stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) within 
word pairs was 2 sec, and 6 sec between word pairs. The stimuli were presented three times with a delay of 30 sec 
between blocks. The order of the vocabulary pairs were randomized within each block. After the learning phase, 
only the Polish words were presented in a random order and participants were asked to write down the German 
counterparts. The inter-stimulus-interval during the recall phase was set to 8 sec. The number of correctly recalled 
words was used as memory score. Two parallel versions of the test were administered. Participants were randomly 
assigned to one of two test versions at pretest and received the parallel version at posttest. One participant of the 
balance group was excluded from the memory test as he had polish language knowledge.
Spatial cognition tests:
 (1) Orienting and Perspective Taking Test (OPT33). The paper-pencil test assesses the ability to imagine scenes 
from different viewpoints. Participants were shown a picture with seven objects. The task was to imagine 
being at one object, facing another, and indicating the direction of a third object by drawing an angle 
estimate. There were 12 items on the same object ensemble to solve during a time limit of 5 min. The errors 
were determined by subtracting the participant’s angle estimate from the correct solution. The mean error 
score across items was calculated for each participant.
 (2) Figure orientation, subscale of the German Intelligence Structure Test (IST-2000R34). The test was present-
ed in a paper-pencil version. Participants were given a set of 20 items, each consisting of different shapes 
that were cut into pieces. The aim was to mentally merge the pieces and to decide which of possible five 
shapes was present. The time limit was set to 7 min. Two parallel versions were used. Participants were 
randomly assigned to one of them at pretest and received the parallel version at posttest. The number of 
correctly solved items within the 7 min long testing phase was used as dependent variable.
 (3) Mirror images, subscale of the German “Wilde Intelligence Test” (WIT235). Five identical but differentially 
rotated nonsense figures were presented; one was a mirror image of the same shape. Participant had to de-
tect the latter. Participants had a time limit of 3 min for a total of 20 trials. Two parallel versions were used. 
Participants were randomly assigned to one of them at pretest and received the parallel version at posttest. 
The number of correctly solved items within the testing period of 3 min was used as dependent variable.
For further analyses, the results of the Orienting and Perspective Taking Test, the Figure Orientation Test and 
the Mirror Image Test were combined into one score: Each participants’ test score was standardized to the mean 
and standard deviation of the respective pretest score, separately for the pretest and posttest ((participant’s score 
at pretest or posttest - sample mean at pretest)/standard deviation at pretest). The mean of the normalized scores 
across the three tests defined the spatial cognition score of each participant.
Executive functions: A computer based German version of the Stroop Test36 was used to assess executive 
functions. The experiment was performed using the Presentation® software (Version 14.9, Neurobehavioral 
Systems, Inc., Berkeley, CA, USA). Color words were presented on a screen, either in a congruent or an incon-
gruent font color (red, yellow, blue green). With a short delay (SOA = 300 ms), a second color word was shown 
underneath, written in gray font color. Participants had to decide whether or not the font color of the upper word 
was congruent with the meaning of the color word written in gray font by pressing one of two buttons as fast as 
possible (yes = left, no = right). The two color words were presented for 1000 ms, followed by a black screen. The 
new fixation cross followed by the next stimulus pair was presented 1000 ms after the participant’s button press. 
Additionally, non-color adjectives (i.e. “empty”
, “high”) printed in color were displayed as a neutral control con-
dition. Forty-eight trials per condition (incongruent, congruent, and neutral) were presented in a randomized 
order. Incorrect trials, and trials with reaction times <200 ms and >3 SD above the group mean per condition

were eliminated. The inference score was defined as the mean reaction time for the incongruent condition minus 
the mean reaction time for the congruent condition.
Participants were familiarized with the task within a 20 trials practice run in which immediate feedback was 
presented after every trial. During the main test, no feedback was given. Three participants did not complete the 
Stroop Test due to being color-blind (n = 2); one was a non-native German speaker.
Further assessments. We assessed participants’ vocabulary, physical activity and general psychopathological 
symptoms with questionnaires. These assessments allowed us to control for potential impact of these variables on 
the above described cognitive functions as well as their change across the intervention phase.
The German “Mehrfachwahl-Wortschatztest” (MWT-B37) was used to estimate verbal intelligence. The partic-
ipant had to find the item out of five which was an existing German word. The four distractors were pronouncea-
ble German pseudo-words of approximately the same length. The test is sensitive to the educational background 
and correlates with the global IQ in healthy adults.
The “Freiburger Questionnaire on Physical Activity” (FQPA38) was used to assess the overall self-reported 
physical activity at pretest and after three months. The questionnaire covers everyday physical activities such as 
taking the stairs, walking to work etc., as well as leisure time and sport activities. Hours of total activity per week 
were additionally converted into metabolic equivalents (MET) to estimate total energy expenditure associated 
with physical activities39.
Self-reported psychopathological symptoms were assessed with the Symptom Checklist-90-R (SCL 90R40). 
The psychometric questionnaire with 90 items on 9 subscales aims to evaluate a broad range of psychological 
strains and psychopathology. The global score (Global Severity Index, GSI) based on all subscales was used to 
compare participant’s psychopathological symptoms across groups and possible changes after the intervention.
Data analysis. 
The data analysis was performed using R, version 3.3.141. Intervention effects were compared 
by means of ANCOVA: In the linear models, posttest scores were compared between groups, adjusted for pretest 
scores and age which were included as covariates42. The results will be displayed as the pretest- and age-adjusted 
group difference at posttest, along with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) and Cohens d as stand-
ardized effect size. The overall α
 level was set to p < 0.05.
Technical problems and interruption during the assessment led to missing data for four single tests (memory: 
n = 1, OPT: n = 1, IST: n = 1, VO2peak: n = 2). Multiple Data Imputation (R package MICE 2.043) was used to 
replace these missing data. For the analyses, 10 imputation models were estimated separately (specification = pre-
dictive mean matching). The different estimates were pooled into one model, which is reported in the results 
section. Associations between changes from pre-to posttest and age were computed using Pearson correlations.

Results
Participants of the balance and the relaxation group did not differ with respect to age, gender, vocabulary 
score, cardiorespiratory fitness, self-reported physical activity, and psychopathological symptoms (see Table 1). 
Moreover, the groups did not differ significantly with respect to the physical and cognitive variables at pretest (all 
p > 0.250, see Table 2).
Physical Variables. 
The balance training increased participants’ dynamic balance performance on the sta-
bility platform as indicated by a significant effect of group, F(1, 36) = 8.72, p = 0.005. The mean of the balance 
training group at posttest was higher than the mean of the relaxation group (see Fig. 2, group difference = 1.57, 
95% CI = [0.49, 2.65], d = 0.66).
There was no significant training effect on neither the CoP sway velocity as assessed with the forceplate, F(1, 
36) < 0.001, p = 0.962, group difference = −
0.001, 95% CI = [−
0.08, 0.08], d = −
0.01, nor on functional bal-
ance, as measured with the BESS, F(1, 36) = 0.16, p = 0.704, group difference = −
0.52, 95% CI = [−
0.3.25, 2.22], 
d = −
0.09.
The training did not increase participants’ cardiorespiratory fitness. There was no significant effect of group 
for VO2peak: F(1, 36) = 0.40, p = 0.531, group difference = −
0.83, 95% CI = [−
3.49, 1.83], d = −
0.14, see Fig. 2.
Cognitive Variables. 
A significant effect of group, F(1, 35) = 4.40, p = 0.043, was found for the memory 
score. After training, the adjusted mean of the balance group was higher than the mean of the relaxation group 
(group difference = 1.60, 95% CI = [0.05, 3.05], d = 0.47, see Fig. 3).
The analysis of spatial score yielded a significant effect of group, F(1, 36) = 5.28, p = 0.027. After training, the 
adjusted spatial score was higher in the balance than in the relaxation training group (group difference = 0.31, 
95% CI = [0.04, 0.58], d = 0.51, see Fig. 3).
To test whether the Stroop effect could reliably be elicited to measure executive functions in the present study, 
reaction times of congruent trials were compared to reaction times of incongruent trials, collapsed across groups 
and time. As expected, participants reacted faster in the congruent condition (M = 664.774 ms, SD = 177.583 ms) 
compared to the incongruent condition (M = 885.564, SD = 239.654 ms), t(134) = 6.37, p < 0.001. To analyze 
training effects on executive functions, an interference score was calculated by subtracting the mean reaction 
time of the incongruent condition from the mean reaction time of the congruent condition for each participant. 
There was no significant effect of group on the Stroop interference score at posttest, F(1, 33) = 0.01, p = 0.911, 
group difference = −
3.47, 95% CI = [−
66.39, 59.44], d = −
0.03 (see Fig. 3).

Self-reported physical activity and psychopathological symptoms. 
On average, participants 
increased their total weekly physical activity from M = 7.62 (SD = 5.58) hours at pretest to M = 10.12 (SD = 6.68) 
hours at posttest. Moreover, they expended more energy per week (MET score) at posttest (M = 34.59, 
SD = 24.07) than at pretest (M = 28.45, SD = 19.16). The average increase in self-reported physical activity reflects 
the participation in the supervised training, i.e. two hours/week with low to moderate intensity. Importantly, for 
the self-reported physical activity, the analysis yielded no significant effect of groups after training: Neither for 
hours/week: F(1, 36) = 0.42, p = 0.521, group difference = −
1.12, 95% CI = [−
4.62, 2.39], d = −
0.17 nor for MET: 
F(1, 36) = 0.04, p = 0.84, group difference = 1.37, 95% CI = [−
12.03, 14.78], d = 0.05, respectively (see Table 2).
The analysis of the psychopathological symptoms assessed with the SCL-90 displayed no significant effect of 
group, F(1, 37) = 0.42, p < 0.521, group difference = 0.035, 95% CI = [−
0.07, 0.14], d = 0.15, see Table 2).

Age did not correlate with changes from pre- to posttest in any of the physical and cognitive variables (all 
r < 0.12, p > 0.250), indicating that younger and older participants did not differ in their benefits after training.
Discussion
The goal of the present randomized controlled intervention study in a group of healthy adults was to test the 
hypothesis that balance training improves cognitive functions, in particular memory and spatial cognition. 
Dynamic balance performance improved only in the balance group from pre- to posttest. By contrast and as 
expected, changes in cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2peak) were observed neither in the balance group nor in the 
relaxation group. Only the balance group improved in memory and spatial cognitive abilities. Finally, none of the 
two groups displayed changes in executive functions.
The findings suggest that systematic balance training is capable of enhancing some cognitive functions, such 
as memory and spatial cognition. Crucially, an increase in cardiorespiratory fitness does not seem to be necessary 
for eliciting beneficial effects of physical exercise on cognitive functions. This pattern implies multiple mecha-
nisms for physical activity affecting cognitive functions.
In the present study, we used a balance training in order to particularly engage the vestibular system. The 
vestibular system essentially contributes to spatial cognition and orientation by detecting linear acceleration dur-
ing self-motion21. Moreover, the vestibular system has anatomical connections to the medial-temporal lobe as 
well as to parieto-temporal cortical networks which are known to be involved in spatial navigation13. Structural 
changes after short-term balance training were found in frontal and parietal areas26. Moreover, professional danc-
ers and slackliners were found to have larger gray matter volumes in the posterior hippocampus but smaller 
volumes in the anterior hippocampus compared to non-balance experts24. The authors interpreted the structural 
differences as indicator of plastic changes following perseverative stimulation of the vestibular-visual pathways 
to the hippocampus. The behavioral improvements in memory and spatial cognition after 12 weeks of balance 
training of the present study are in accord with these structural data. The balance training group improved in 
a paired-associative learning task which is associated with the hippocampal memory system44. Perspective

taking abilities and mental rotation tasks seem both to rely on bilateral parietal cortices and the hippocampus45, 
respectively.
We did not find improvements of executive functions after the balance (and relaxation) training. Results of 
a study comparing coordination, aerobic and stretching training in older adults reported benefits in both phys-
ically active training groups on executive functions5. The coordination training in the study of Voelcker-Rehage 
et al. focused on fine and gross motor coordination rather than on balance like the present study. The effects 
of balance training might be more restricted to memory and spatial functioning. Improvements in executive 
functions in studies implementing aerobic exercise programs have been repeatedly observed28. In the present 
study, participants underwent a graded ergospirometry before and after the intervention to control for possible 
changes in cardiorespiratory fitness. Neither the balance group nor the relaxation group significantly changed in 
cardiorespiratory fitness.
In addition, participants of the present sample were on average younger and the age range was much broader 
than in previous studies46. It has been hypothesized that cognitive functions are particularly susceptible to treat-
ment such as physical exercise interventions, when they undergo age-related change2. Therefore, another reason 
for lacking a significant effect in executive functions might be the broad age range of the present sample. We did 
not find differences in the performance change between younger and older participants, neither in physical nor in 
cognitive variables. Future studies should comprise larger sample sizes to investigate possible differences between 
age groups with a higher power.
The present findings demonstrate beneficial effects of balance training, compared to relaxation training, on 
memory and spatial cognition. In order to conclude that group differences at posttest are explained by the specific 
balance training, possible alternative accounts need to be discussed: Balance training comprises proprioceptive, 
visual and motor learning to a larger degree than relaxation training. The vestibular neural pathways are inher-
ently multisensory, and vestibular signals converge with proprioceptive, visual and tactile information at early 
stages, such as brainstem vestibular nuclei and deep cerebellar fastigial nuclei in the afferent pathway12. Whether 
one of the sub-processes or rather the integration of vestibular, somatosensory and visual signals are essential for 
the training induced increase in memory and spatial cognition, must be addressed in future studies. Tasks requir-
ing coordination with a partner and objects were introduced to make the training diversified and more appealing 
for the participants. Although the relaxation group acquired two different relaxation techniques, overall task 
complexity was higher in the balance training group. We cannot fully exclude the possibility that complexity as 
such improved performance in the experimental group, though we consider this account as unlikely: Practicing to 
handle and coordinate more complex task demands is a typical executive function, rather than being specifically 
linked to memory and spatial skills. However, groups did not differ in executive functions at posttest.
Physical activity is known to have antidepressant and anxiolytic effects and to increase resilience to stress47. In 
the present study, a global score of psychopathological symptoms was assessed at baseline and after the interven-
tion. Importantly, the score did not differ between groups at pretest, nor did groups differ in their change from 
pretest to posttest, rendering it unlikely that a reduction in psychological distress might account for the present 
findings. Additionally, both training groups displayed the same level of self-reported habitual physical activity 
(MET) over time. The increase of two additional hours of physical activity per week at posttest compared to 
pretest was recorded in both groups and reflected the participation in the intervention. Therefore, the observed 
improvements in memory and spatial cognition are likely related to the balance intervention.
In sum, we are able to conclude that 12 weeks of balance training in healthy adults has positive effects on 
memory and spatial cognition, and an increase in cardiorespiratory fitness does not seem to be necessary to 
induce beneficial effects of physical exercise on cognition.
From an applied perspective, balance training might represent a promising alternative intervention for indi-
viduals who are not able to participate in aerobic training following health restrictions.
