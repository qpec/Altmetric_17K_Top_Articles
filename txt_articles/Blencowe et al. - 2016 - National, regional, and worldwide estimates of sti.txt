Summary
Background Previous estimates have highlighted a large global burden of stillbirths, with an absence of reliable data from 
regions where most stillbirths occur. The Every Newborn Action Plan (ENAP) targets national stillbirth rates (SBRs) of 
12 or fewer stillbirths per 1000 births by 2030. We estimate SBRs and numbers for 195 countries, including trends from 
2000 to 2015.
Methods We collated SBR data meeting prespecifi
 ed inclusion criteria from national routine or registration systems, 
nationally representative surveys, and other data sources identifi
 ed through a systematic review, web-based searches, 
and consultation with stillbirth experts. We modelled SBR (≥28 weeks’ gestation) for 195 countries with restricted 
maximum likelihood estimation with country-level random eff
 ects. Uncertainty ranges were obtained through a 
bootstrap approach.
Findings Data from 157 countries (2207 datapoints) met the inclusion criteria, a 90% increase from 2009 estimates. 
The estimated average global SBR in 2015 was 18·4 per 1000 births, down from 24·7 in 2000 (25·5% reduction). In 
2015, an estimated 2·6 million (uncertainty range 2·4–3·0 million) babies were stillborn, giving a 19% decline in 
numbers since 2000 with the slowest progress in sub-Saharan Africa. 98% of all stillbirths occur in low-income and 
middle-income countries; 77% in south Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.
Interpretation Progress in reducing the large worldwide stillbirth burden remains slow and insuffi
  cient to meet 
national targets such as for ENAP. Stillbirths are increasingly being counted at a local level, but countries and the 
global community must further improve the quality and comparability of data, and ensure that this is more clearly 
linked to accountability processes including the Sustainable Development Goals.

Introduction
WHO fi
 rst published national, regional, and worldwide 
estimates of stillbirths in 2011, highlighting the large 
global burden of stillbirths, with an estimated 2·6 million 
women and families aff
 ected in 2009.1 This process also 
showed the dearth of reliable data in the regions where 
most stillbirths occur. In 2014, the Every Newborn Action 
Plan, a global multipartner movement to end preventable 
maternal and newborn deaths and stillbirths, set a target 
for national stillbirth rates (SBRs) of 12 or fewer 
stillbirths per 1000 births in all countries by 2030, 
accompanied by action in countries to address 
disparities.2 This stillbirth target was included in 
response to the requests of many countries during the 
consultation process.3 To achieve this target, countries 
will need to act to reduce preventable stillbirths and 
improve monitoring of SBRs. 4,5
In this study, our objective was to estimate national, 
regional, and worldwide stillbirth rates and absolute 
numbers for 195 countries in both 2000 and 2015, to 
enable an assessment to be made of the extent to which 
SBRs have changed over time.
We sought to improve on the 2011 WHO exercise and 
our work previous to that6 in terms of both the quantity 
of SBR data, by undertaking more extensive searches, 
and the quality of the data, by applying more stringent 
inclusion and exclusion criteria. Variation in defi
 nitions 
used for stillbirths aff
 ects comparability. For this exercise, 
we examined the eff
 ect of diff
 erent defi
 nitions, and 
sought to adjust all input SBR data to correspond to a 
standard defi
 nition (≥28 weeks’ gestation) before 
modelling.
We present our methods and results using the 
Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health 
Estimates Reporting (GATHER) checklist. This is a new 
reporting checklist for worldwide health estimates that 
promotes transparency, including the sharing of input 
data and modelling code.7
Methods
Data inputs
For the purposes of these estimates, we defi
 ned a 
stillbirth as a baby born with no signs of life at 28 weeks’ 
gestation or more (third trimester; panel). When

presenting results by region, we used the Millennium 
Development Goal (MDG) regions (appendix pp 3–4).
The database for the previous WHO stillbirth estimates1 
included 1149 datapoints covering the period 1995–2009, 
and this was updated with data covering the whole period 
from 1990 to 2015. SBR data were identifi
 ed from multiple 
sources (fi
 gure 1) including national routine data defi
 ned 
as data from national systems such as civil registration and 
vital statistics (CRVS) systems, national health management 
information systems (HMIS), and birth registries; 
nationally representative surveys including demographic 
and health surveys (DHS) and reproductive health surveys 
(RHS); and subnational data sources including population-
based studies (eg, from demographic surveillance sites or 
research studies), and facility-based data.
To identify routine national data, we searched the 
websites of the national statistical offi
  ce and ministry of 
health of all countries. For countries where routine CRVS 
systems are less well developed (those outside the MDG 
Developed region), we identifi
 ed additional sources of data 
for SBRs. These included compiling all DHS and RHS 
reports from the DHS programme website, and 
undertaking a systematic search of the published literature 
(appendix pp 5–7). Searches included terms relating to the 
following key concepts: “stillbirth”, “stillbirth timing”, 
“rate/prevalence”, and “low and middle income (LMIC) 
countries”. MESH headings were used where available. 
Because SBR data can be collected in other programme 
and study settings, but not reported via the above 
mechanisms, a Stillbirth Epidemiology Investigator Group 
was convened to identify further unpublished stillbirth 
rate data, with calls for data distributed via relevant groups 
and list serves, and investigators from individual studies 
approached (appendix p 8). An eff
 ort was made to include 
HMIS data from the District Health Information Systems 2 
platform, with emails sent to national contact persons.
WHO’s country consultation process was used to 
confi
 rm, for every country, the validity of the data from 
that country included as inputs in the estimation process, 
and to ask for any additional data. Preliminary estimates 
were also circulated to WHO member states for review. 
New or updated country-year observations (282 from 
25 countries) were added through the consultation process 
in July and August, 2015—mainly more recent data, or 
resubmitted data using the 28 week or more defi
 nition.
We assessed all reports that included more than 50 total 
births with a midpoint of data collection of 1990 or later 
and in which an SBR was given or could be calculated. 
Although we aimed to estimate SBRs using the 28 week 
or more defi
 nition, in the input database, we included 
SBR data using other defi
 nitions. Data reports from 
specialised services such as diabetes, hypertension, or 
growth restriction clinics or on specifi
 c subpopulations 
or ethnic groups were excluded as non-generalisable. We 
classifi
 ed health facility data as likely to have minimum 
bias, where the facility covered more than 90% of births 
in the population. We excluded population-based 
prospective studies with rates of loss to follow-up of more 
than 20% of pregnant women. Similar to the approach 
taken for the previous stillbirth estimates, data from 
health facilities with potential for greater bias were 
included and identifi
 ed using a dummy variable.1

Research in context
Evidence before this study
Previous global estimates for stillbirths have been undertaken, 
of which the most recent was for 2009 by WHO.1 Stillbirths 
were not tracked under the Millennium Development Goals, 
and progress in reducing stillbirths is slower than that for 
maternal or neonatal deaths. In 2014, the Every Newborn 
Action Plan set a target of a national stillbirth rate of 12 or 
fewer stillbirths per 1000 births by 2030 and to address within-
country disparities in all countries. However, stillbirths are still 
not included in global burden estimates or global goals.
Added value of this study
Through systematic searches (national statistical offi
  ce, 
ministry of health and nationally representative household 
survey websites, and published literature) and consultation 
with a group of stillbirth investigators to identify further 
unpublished stillbirth data, we compiled the largest stillbirth 
rate dataset so far. The fi
 nal dataset included 2207 datapoints 
from 157 countries, almost doubled from 1149 datapoints 
from 135 countries in the previous estimation exercise. This 
increase was predominantly due to increased data availability 
from national routine data sources in middle-income countries. 
We also improved the consistency of the stillbirth defi
 nitions, 
and strengthened the criteria for quality of data. These national 
stillbirth rates estimates are for 195 countries for 2015 with 
time-trends from 2000.
Implications of all the available evidence
We estimate that 2·6 million (uncertainty range 2·4–3·0 million) 
babies were stillborn in 2015, aff
 ecting women and their 
families in all settings. 98% were in low-income and 
middle-income countries, of which over two-thirds were in 
sub-Saharan Africa and southern Asia. Data from 39 countries 
with complete time series shows slow progress in reducing this 
burden. Nearly half (45%) of the data available is for the 2% of 
stillbirths from developed regions, and more must be done to 
close this data gap and improve data quality and comparability 
in all settings. Stillbirths are increasingly being counted at a local 
level; however, absence of global goals and reporting 
mechanisms continues to restrict their visibility, especially in the 
countries with the greatest disease burden. Unless this changes, 
stillbirths are likely to remain invisible beyond 2015.

defi
 nition were adjusted to correspond with the 28 week 
or more defi
 nition. For 15 countries in the MDG 
Developed region with high quality CRVS data, where 
stillbirth rates based on more than one defi
 nition were 
available for a given year, a pooled estimate of the 
adjustment factor was calculated using all years with 
more than one defi
 nition from that country, and the 
stillbirth rates were adjusted for all years reporting only 
an alternative defi
 nition using this adjustment factor. For 
34 countries in the MDG Developed region without such 
data, the rates were adjusted on the basis of meta-
analyses of data from countries in the same region. For 
example, based on a meta-analysis of 139 country-years 
of data, where the 28 week or more rate was 32% lower 
than the 22 week or more rate, a data source reporting a 
stillbirth rate of 6·2 using the 22 week or more defi
 nition 
was adjusted as follows: 6·2 × 0·68 = 4·2 stillbirths at 
28 weeks or more per 1000 total births (panel; appendix 
pp 72–75). For countries in other regions (n=146), data 
were adjusted based on a meta-analysis of data from the 
WHO global survey on maternal and perinatal health 
and the WHO multicountry survey on maternal and 
newborn health, which included more than 0·5 million 
births (appendix pp 75–76).11,12 Data were not available for 
gestational age in these facility-based surveys, so the 
500 g and 1000 g cutoff
 s were used to approximate 
22 weeks and 28 weeks, respectively. Although our new 
meta-analysis of routine data from high-income settings 
shows that use of a 1000 g cutoff
  instead of a 28-week 
based one underestimates the gestational age rate by 
around 15% (panel), this eff
 ect could be less in LMICs, 
where a greater proportion of stillbirths are intrapartum 
at term without fetal growth restriction, owing to lower 
access to high quality intrapartum care. However, it was 
not possible to quantify the degree of underestimation, 
and currently it is assumed that birthweight and 
gestational age thresholds are equivalent for stillbirths in 
these regions; this assumption is likely to underestimate 
the true burden of stillbirths at 28 weeks or more.
Additionally, for countries with data for several years 
but small birth cohorts and hence relatively large annual 
variations in SBRs (coeffi
  cients of variation >10%; Cook 
Islands, Andorra, Iceland, Luxembourg, and Malta), data 
were smoothed using a moving average (appendix p 72).
Exclusion criteria
Underascertainment of stillbirths is recognised as a 
common problem across data sources, especially when 
using defi
 nitions with cutoff
 s close to the threshold of 
newborn viability. For example, fetal deaths are 
commonly coded as miscarriages when the health 
provider assesses the baby to be below the threshold of 
viability. While in many high-income countries this is 
most likely to aff
 ect fetal deaths at 22 weeks’ and 
23 weeks’ gestation, in lower resource settings, without 
neonatal intensive care, fetal deaths up to 30 weeks’ 
gestation might not be included in stillbirth fi
 gures.
We excluded datapoints likely to refl
 ect poor case 
ascertainment based on a conservative implausibility 
criterion for the ratio SBR:neonatal mortality rate 
(NMR).13 The median ratio of SBRs (≥28 weeks) to NMRs 
from the developed region was 0·9 (IQR 0·65–1·15). 
Ratios less than 0·33 (fi
 rst centile) are likely to represent 
substantial under-recording of stillbirths in comparison 
with neonatal deaths. Generally, stillbirths are more 
poorly recorded than deaths of liveborn neonates, which 
are themselves under-recorded in many settings.5,13 
Because ratios within the normal range will be found 
where there is under-reporting of both stillbirths and 
neonatal deaths in a given data source—eg, in some 
household surveys—we calculated the ratio of the 
reported SBR (≥28 weeks) relative to the national 
estimate of NMR for the same year, and excluded 
datapoints with a ratio of less than 0·33 (n=116). No 
upper limit for the ratio was set. Although some 
misclassifi
 cation of neonatal deaths as stillbirths can 
occur, especially in lower resource settings, this eff
 ect is 
Panel: Defi
 nition of stillbirth
A fetal death or stillbirth is defi
 ned as a baby born with no signs of life after a given 
threshold. For international comparison, WHO defi
 nes a stillbirth according to the 
10th edition of the International Classifi
 cation of Diseases (ICD-10) defi
 nition of late fetal 
death. ICD-10, which was developed several decades ago when gestational age assessment 
was not standard, gives birthweight as the fi
 rst preference in the defi
 nition, with 
gestational age second. ICD-108 defi
 nes late fetal death as a death at a birthweight of 
1000 g or more, if the birthweight is not available, a gestational age of 28 weeks or more 
or a length of 35 cm or more. The corresponding values are 500 g, 22 weeks, or 25 cm or 
more for early fetal death, and 500 g, 22 weeks, or 25 cm or more for miscarriage.
However, the birthweight and gestational age thresholds do not give equivalent results. 
This problem is compounded by the frequent occurrence of fetal growth restriction, 
associated with an adverse intrauterine environment before fetal death, and hence a 
birthweight-based cutoff
  will give a lower stillbirth rate than one based on gestational 
age. This diff
 erence is most marked the earlier the gestational age: in our new 
meta-analyses, stillbirth rates across high-income countries were 15% (95% CI 13–17) 
lower using a 1000 g or more defi
 nition compared with 28 weeks or more, whereas 
stillbirth rates in the USA are 40% lower with the 500 g or more defi
 nition compared with 
22 weeks or more.  
A gestational age threshold would be most appropriate because it is a better predictor of 
maturity and hence viability than is birthweight, with many fetuses at risk of stillbirth or 
preterm birth having preceding fetal growth restriction.9 Information about gestational age 
is also more widely available than for birthweight for many stillbirths, with early ultrasound 
dating of pregnancies now standard of care in high-income and middle-income countries, 
and its use is increasing in low-income countries. Hence, most high-income and 
middle-income national routine data now include robust gestational age data. Even in 
settings where gestational age is mainly based on last menstrual period, which is less 
reliable than early ultrasound dating, it is more commonly available than birthweight, 
especially for those born at home where it is frequently seen as not culturally acceptable to 
weigh a stillborn baby.10 
Therefore, we use a 28 week or more defi
 nition. Where possible, data were abstracted or 
requested according to this defi
 nition. Data with alternative defi
 nitions were adjusted to 
the 28 week or more defi
 nition (appendix pp 72–75).

relatively small on the SBR:NMR ratio,14 and evidence 
from high-income countries shows increasing SBR:NMR 
ratios as NMRs reduce below three per 1000 livebirths 
(appendix pp 8–9). Six datapoints had a ratio of more 
than 3·0, but these were small, high-income countries 
reporting very low NMRs in the given year, and the SBRs 
from these were in keeping with other years’ estimates 
from these countries.
Classifi
 cation of stillbirth data type
Included data were categorised into fi
 ve classes, which 
were determined a priori, based on data type and quality. 
A dummy variable was created based on these fi
 ve types 
(fi
 gure 1): national routine information systems, further 
categorised as high quality or lower quality; nationally 
representative retrospective household surveys; sub-
national 
population-based 
data—ie, 
prospective 
population-based studies or health-facility-based data 
with minimum bias (covering >90% of births in the 
population); and other subnational data—ie, other 
health-facility-based data with possible sources of bias.
No previously established reliable quality criteria for 
assessing the capture of stillbirths were identifi
 ed. Hence, 
in this exercise, data from national routine information 
systems were categorised as being of high quality if they 
met the following criteria. First, if a functioning CRVS 
system was well established before 2000. Consistent with 
previous stillbirth estimates,1 we used good vital 
registration for purposes of maternal mortality estimation, 
which included the requirement of a functioning CRVS 
system from 1996, including the ability to capture high 
quality information about maternal and perinatal 
outcomes.15 Second, if the SBR (adjusted to 28 week 
defi
 nition) to national estimated NMR ratio was greater 
than 0·5 for all years in the time series. Third, if, for the 
given year, the country had a greater than 85% female 
child mortality capture16 (a marker of CRVS system 
strength for capture of child outcomes; appendix pp 67–68).
For countries assessed as having high quality CRVS, 
we assumed that other routinely collected national 
data—eg, birth registry or HMIS data—would also be of 
high quality. All other country-years of national routine 
data not fulfi
 lling all the above criteria were considered to 
be of lower quality (appendix p 69).

restricted maximum likelihood estimation and included 
a country-level random eff
 ect, using the same approach 
as the previous estimates.1 We investigated multiple 
predictor variables with an established association with 
SBR, and with estimates available for all countries for the 
period 2000–15.
Potential predictors were selected based on the 
plausibility of an association with the SBR. These 
included distal determinants such as socioeconomic 
factors, 
and 
more 
proximal 
demographic 
and 
biomedical factors, markers of perinatal outcome and 
access to health care. All potential predictors with time 
series data or estimates available by country for 2000–15 
were included in the model fi
 tting process (appendix 
pp 76–77). Predictors were retained when the direction 
of the coeffi
  cient was biologically plausible. We sought 
to maximise the predictive power of the model, while 
avoiding overfi
 tting. We removed one predictor at a 
time from the model, commencing with the predictor 
with the largest Bayesian information criterion (BIC) 
on univariate analysis, and refi
 tted the model. If the 
model was improved by removing this predictor (lower 
BIC compared with the model containing the predictor), 
the predictor was dropped from the model. If the BIC 
was higher, the predictor was retained. We cycled 
through all the predictors once. For the 157 countries 
contributing data to the input dataset, the best linear 
prediction of the country-specifi
 c random eff
 ect was 
obtained.
The fi
 nal model included: (natural log) of NMR, 
(natural log) low birthweight rate, (natural log) gross 
national income, mean years of female education, 
coverage of four antenatal care visits, the stillbirth data 
type (see above), and region (based on condensed 
Millennium Development Goal regions—Developed, 
South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, and Other regions) 
(appendix p 77). Model performance was assessed with 
diagnostic plots (appendix pp 78–79).
Uncertainty estimation
Uncertainty estimates were generated with a bootstrap 
approach. For countries with high quality vital 
registration data for stillbirths, we assumed that the SE 
of the reported number of stillbirths was the square root 
of the reported number—ie, that the number of stillbirths 
was Poisson distributed (appendix p 99).
Generation of estimated national stillbirth rates and 
absolute numbers
For all countries the SBR was calculated as the number 
of stillbirths per 1000 total births, the total births 
including both livebirths and stillbirths ≥28 weeks.
Of the 45 countries classifi
 ed as having high quality 
vital registration data for SBRs, 39 had complete time 
series data (earliest year of data available was before 
2005, the latest year after 2010, and data were available 
for at least half of all years). For these countries, the 
country’s own reported rates, adjusted where necessary

(see above), were smoothed with loess regression to 
produce estimated trends for 2000–15 (fi
 gure 1; appendix 
pp 80–98). For all other countries, estimation and 
projection of SBRs was undertaken with the regression 
model as detailed above. For countries with data in the 
input dataset, the best linear unbiased prediction of the 
country-specifi
 c eff
 ect was included in the SBR 
prediction. For countries with no data, the random eff
 ect 
was assumed to be zero. The high quality national data 
(CRVS or birth registry) was used as the gold standard 
for prediction purposes for all countries. Livebirth 
estimates from the World Population Prospects, 2015 
revision,17 were used to estimate the absolute number of 
stillbirths using the following formula: number of 
stillbirths = livebirths × SBR / (1 – SBR).
Role of the funding source
The funders had no role in the study design, data 
collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of

Results
The fi
 nal SBR input dataset included 2207 datapoints 
from 157 countries (fi
 gure 1). Overall, we excluded 
152 (6%) datapoints with an SBR:NMR less than 0·33. 
National surveys were more likely to have data excluded 
for this reason (33/160 [21%]) than were national CRVS 
or registry data (108/1863 [6%]) or subnational data 
sources (11/327 [3%]).
80% more datapoints were included from all regions 
than in previous estimates (appendix pp 67–68). Compared 
with the previous exercise, the greatest relative increases 
in datapoints were in sub-Saharan Africa (177%), southern 
Asia (190%), and eastern Asia (414%). An increase in 
subnational datapoints is seen; however, from a low 
baseline, large relative increases in routine national data 
availability have been seen in both sub-Saharan Africa and 
southern Asia regions (293% and 233% increase, 
respectively), with 37% of countries in sub-Saharan Africa 
and 44% of those in southern Asia now contributing 
national routine data. Data increases in Latin America and 
north Africa or west Asia are largely due to increases in 
data from routine national data sources since 2000 
(fi
 gure 2). Nevertheless, no data were located for 
38 countries, and only subnational data were available for 
nine sub-Saharan African and south Asian countries.
Important diff
 erences in the types of data available 
from diff
 erent regions remain. More than 70% of 
countries in the developed, north Africa, west Asia, and 
Caucasus and central Asia regions have national data 
meeting the inclusion criteria for both 2000 and 2010, 
compared with around a quarter of countries in 
sub-Saharan Africa and southern and southeastern Asia 
in 2000. There is some evidence of improvement in these 
lower-income regions by 2010. However, for many of the 
large countries in these regions, the national data are 
from retrospective household surveys, which have major 
limitations for SBR capture, and further research is 
required to address these (fi
 gure 2; table 1).5
Table 2 shows the estimated coeffi
  cients for the 
predictors retained in the fi
 nal model. Each unit increase 
in natural log NMR is associated with a 0·33 unit 
increase in natural log SBR. Unit increases in natural log 
low birthweight are associated with a 0·014 unit increase 
in natural log SBR, whereas a unit increase in natural log 
gross national income, coverage of four antenatal care 
visits, and female education are associated with decreases 
in natural log SBR (by 0·13, 0·004, and 0·03 units, 
respectively). 
Compared 
with 
high 
quality 
vital 
registration, facility-based data that are subject to bias are 
estimated to overestimate the SBR, whereas all other data 
sources tend to underestimate the SBR. The model

(SD 0·29) and the residuals for the individual datapoints 
included (SD 0·23) seem to be approximately normally 
distributed (appendix pp 78–79).
We estimate that the global SBR in 2015 was 18·4 per 
1000 births (uncertainty range 16·6–21·0), down from 24·7 
in 2000 (22·4–28·4; table 3). This represents an estimated 
25·5% decline in the global SBR over this period. Although 
the uncertainty around this estimated reduction is sizeable 
(uncertainty range 6·6–41·5%), some decline in stillbirth 
rate over this time period is likely. The absolute number of 
stillbirths is estimated to have declined from 3·25 million 
in 2000 (uncertainty range 2·93–3·74 million) to 
2·62 million in 2015 (2·36–2·98 million), a 19·4% decline 
(–1·8 to 36·9%). The highest burden, both in terms of 
stillbirth rates and numbers of stillbirths, continues to be 
found in sub-Saharan Africa and southern Asian regions: 
98% of all stillbirths occur in low-income and middle-
income countries; 77% in south Asia and sub-Saharan 
Africa (table 3; fi
 gure 3). The estimated rate of reduction in 
stillbirth rates remains slowest in sub-Saharan Africa 
(1·4%), despite high baseline stillbirth rates. At a national 
level for 2015, six countries in western Europe were 
predicted to have SBRs of less than two per 1000 total 
births, whereas Pakistan and 13 countries in sub-Saharan 
Africa had estimated stillbirth rates of more than 30 per 
1000 total births, with relatively slow progress since 2000 
(appendix pp 100–05).

stillbirth rate in 2009 is 20·3 (uncertainty range 
18·4–23·0), compared with 18·9 (15·2–27·3) in the 
previous estimates. Of note, these two sets of estimates 
are not directly comparable. In this study, we attempted 
to estimate stillbirth rates using the 28 week or more 
defi
 nition, which would be expected to result in higher 
rates than in estimates based mainly on birthweight 
from the previous exercise. Changes for individual 
countries are mainly those for which new data have 
become available (appendix pp 8–67).
Discussion
Our estimates suggest that 2·6 million (2·4–3·0 million) 
babies were stillborn at 28 weeks or more in 2015. This 
represents a large burden for women, families, 
communities, and health-care providers.18 Progress in 
reducing stillbirth rates is slower than that required to 
meet targets set to end preventable stillbirths,3 and 
considerably slower than for maternal mortality reduction 
and for child mortality reduction, especially after the fi
 rst 
month of life.19 Despite this large burden, stillbirths 
remain barely visible on the global policy agenda.20
These new estimates are based on 80% more national 
datapoints than our previous estimates, with more such 
datapoints in all regions—notably from south and east 
Asia and sub-Saharan Africa (appendix pp 67–68). 
National-level data, from routine national data sources or 
nationally representative surveys, were available for more 
than three-quarters of countries in most regions, apart 
from sub-Saharan Africa (61% countries with national 
data) and southeastern Asia (32% of countries). However, 
there still remains huge variation in data availability and 
quality, especially over time, to enable improved tracking 
of stillbirth rate trends. Despite some progress, almost 
half (45%) of all datapoints are from the developed 
region, which accounts for fewer than 2% of the world’s 
stillbirths, with only 17% from sub-Saharan Africa and 
south Asia, which account for 77% of stillbirths and 
where the stillbirth rate is ten-fold higher (fi
 gure 2).
Although we tested a wider range of potential predictors 
of stillbirth in this exercise, the fi
 nal model was broadly 
similar to that used in the last exercise. Of the predictors 
retained in the model, low birthweight can be secondary to 
both fetal growth restriction and to preterm birth. Both 
fetal growth restriction and preterm birth are strongly 
associated with placental dysfunction and subsequent poor 
fetal health, which carry increased risk of both antepartum 
stillbirth, and, for a compromised fetus who handles the 
labour process poorly, intrapartum stillbirth. Of the other 
predictors, antenatal care coverage, neonatal mortality, and 
gross national income are associated with access to health-
care services during pregnancy and at the time of birth. 
Stillbirth rates are highly sensitive to access to timely high 
quality antenatal and intrapartum monitoring and care;19 
however, the available indicators for these capture only 
coverage, and not eff
 ective coverage or the quality of these 
interventions. Women’s empowerment plays an important 
part in reducing stillbirths, because women are able to 
maximise their prepregnancy health, access family 
planning enabling them to plan the timing of their 
pregnancies when desired, and demand and engage in 
high-quality antenatal and intrapartum care.21 Our model 
includes mean years of maternal education, which might 
capture some of the variation in women’s empowerment 
across settings.
Our estimates represent third trimester stillbirths and 
hence undercount the true burden if earlier fetal deaths 
were included. In high-income settings around half of 
fetal deaths at 20 weeks or more occur before 28 weeks’ 
gestational age.22,23 Further research is required to 
quantify the eff
 ect of including all fetal deaths of 20 weeks 
or more across low-income and middle-income settings. 
Stillbirth capture is lower around the threshold of 
viability. It is plausible therefore that in settings without 
neonatal intensive care, with near-universal neonatal 
mortality among babies born at less than 28 weeks, that 
these babies would be under-captured in statistics.
We sought to identify national routine data of the 
highest quality and use this as the gold standard for 
prediction purposes. No guidelines exist on the optimum 
classifi
 cation of quality of stillbirth rate data from 
national routine sources. We sought to apply criteria 
consistent with previous estimation exercises; however, 
we were constrained by the availability of routine data 
sources 
to 
assess 
quality—notably 
reporting 
by 
gestational age—and further research is required to 
optimise these parameters. As in previous exercises, the 
results of our model suggest that population-based data 
sources outside of the developed regions consistently 
under-report SBRs compared with high quality routine 
national data systems, and have much wider uncertainty 
(table 1). For countries without high quality CRVS time 
series data, the estimated trends are mainly driven by 
covariate data, which might not fully capture any changes 
in stillbirth rates over the same time period.
A major limitation is the low quality of some of the data 
available. We excluded 152 so-called implausible 
datapoints based on a simple assessment of the 
SBR:NMR ratio. Of included datapoints, the median 
ratio of SBR:NMR in DHS/RHS was 0·6 (IQR 0·47–0·73) 
compared with 1·03 (0·80–1·30) for higher quality CRVS 
(table 1)]. More research regarding the SBR:NMR ratio, 
and other markers of quality—eg, markers of birth 
outcome capture measured around the threshold of 
viability where under-reporting is more common,24 the 
use of intrapartum or antepartum stillbirth ratios and 
birthweight, 
or 
gestational 
age 
distributions 
in 
stillbirths—will be important to ensure that increases in 
data quantity can also be better assessed for quality.
Progress has recently been made in estimation of 
neonatal mortality rate, which shifted from intermittent 
estimates up to a decade apart to annual UN national 
estimates, with improvements in modelling and high 
visibility in UNICEF reports alongside child mortality, in

part driven by the MDG 4 target (appendix p 208).25,26 This 
should also be possible for stillbirths, but will require 
increased leadership and accountability for the data.
Improving measurement of stillbirths must occur 
alongside improvements in recording of all birth outcomes 
for mothers and their babies. The limitations of global 
estimates have been highlighted,27 and eff
 orts to support 
systems working towards high-quality reported data are 
sorely needed. Table 4 highlights some of the factors to be 
considered when seeking to improve the quality and 
availability of SBR data. Further recommendations 
regarding other aspects of stillbirth data, such as 
classifi
 cation systems, are outlined in the Lancet Ending 
preventable stillbirths Series.19 SBR data are collected and 
collated through death certifi
 cate data or routine hospital 
data—eg, birth registries, perinatal death surveillance, or 
hospital management information systems, linked to 
CRVS systems—in most high-income and many middle-
income 
countries; 
however, 
inconsistent 
stillbirth 
defi
 nition makes comparisons of SBR data between 
countries and over time challenging. This could be rapidly 
remedied by consistent use of a gestational age threshold 
(≥22 and ≥28 weeks).
However, most stillbirths occur in settings without 
strong CRVS and routine data systems. As these systems 
develop, priorities should include ensuring that all 
facility births, including stillbirths, are recorded and 
collated in routine health information systems, linked to 
CRVS and made available in the public domain. The 
current expansion of DHIS2 provides a platform for this, 
and could rapidly increase the quantity of SBR data 
available. Integration of perinatal deaths into maternal 
death surveillance and response where available is 
another potential source of improving data availability 
and of facilitating data-based action at a local level. All 
facility births should also be registered, including details 
on vital status, gestational age, and birthweight. To 
achieve this, further work is required to improve both

birthweight measurement and the accuracy of gestational 
age assessment. Assessment of gestational age is a 
crucial metric to enable improved capture of birth 
outcomes. Currently, assessments are restricted by the 
methods used, especially in settings where routine fi
 rst 
trimester ultrasound dating is not widespread.30–32 
Possible approaches to improve gestational age could 
include improving recall of last menstrual period, 
biomarkers, ultrasound assessment of gestational age 
after the fi
 rst trimester, and improved algorithms to 
enable a best gestational age estimate.30,33 At a minimum, 
death records should include the time of death 
(antepartum, intrapartum, or age at neonatal death). 
Currently, time of death is poorly assessed and recorded, 
but should be possible for all facility births.3,13,34,35
For the 45 million births occurring outside facilities, 
most without a skilled attendant, household surveys are 
the largest source of population-based SBR data. However, 
the capture of stillbirths in these surveys remains mainly 
low quality. Recent evidence has highlighted the stigma 
and taboos around stillbirths that persist in many cultures, 
which might aff
 ect a woman’s or family member’s 
response to a survey question.18,36,37 Despite being listed as 
a top priority to improve the SBR data inputs in 2011,5 no 
research has yet been undertaken to compare pregnancy 
and livebirth history modules in terms of accuracy, time 
load, and relative costs, or to investigate the process of 
stillbirth data collection in surveys, including standard 
operating procedures for interviewers for this potentially 
sensitive information, especially where interviewers are 
male. Such research is urgently needed.38
Our estimates, even given the uncertainty in high-
burden countries, indicate a large number of stillbirths, 
and little progress in reducing them. As the Sustainable 
Development Goal (SDG) era begins, stillbirths have 
gained some visibility. Despite no SDG target,21 the Every 
Newborn Action Plan included a national target2 and the 
WHO Global Reference List of 100 Core Health Indicators 
lists SBR.39 Increasingly, stillbirths are routinely reported 
in national data and, especially in low-income and 
middle-income countries, there is an increase in 
population-based SBR data.
We welcome these changes. However, to ensure 
continued and increased momentum, as well as more 
and better data, leadership is required.1,35 The high 
burden alone has been insuffi
  cient to drive appropriate 
action. More voice must be given to aff
 ected families, 
especially women. The leadership gap must also be 
addressed to ensure the gains in women’s and children’s 
health are accompanied by comparable reductions in 
stillbirths, especially in high-burden countries where 
most stillbirths could be prevented with known, low-cost, 
and eff
 ective interventions.
