Abstract
Poorly controlled pain is a global public health issue. The personal,
familial
and
societal
costs
are
immeasurable. Only
a minority
of
European patients have access to a comprehensive specialist pain clinic.
More commonly the responsibility for chronic pain management and
initiating opioid therapy rests with the primary care physician and other
non-specialist
opioid
prescribers.
There
is
much
confusing
and
conflicting information available to non-specialist prescribers regarding
opioid therapy and a great deal of unjustified fear is generated. Opioid
therapy should only be initiated by competent clinicians as part of a
multi-faceted treatment programme in circumstances where more simple
measures have failed. Throughout, all patients must be kept under close
clinical surveillance. As with any other medical therapy, if the treatment
fails to yield the desired results and/or the patient is additionally
burdened by an unacceptable level of adverse effects, the overall
management strategy must be reviewed and revised. No responsible
clinician will wish to pursue a failed treatment strategy or persist with
an ineffective and burdensome treatment. In a considered attempt to
empower and inform non-specialist opioid prescribers, EFIC convened a
European group of experts, drawn from a diverse range of basic science
and
relevant
clinical
disciplines,
to
prepare
a
position
paper
on
appropriate opioid use in chronic pain. The expert panel reviewed the
available literature and harnessed the experience of many years of
clinical practice to produce these series of recommendations. Its success
will be judged on the extent to which it contributes to an improved pain
management experience for chronic pain patients across Europe.
Significance: This position paper provides expert recommendations for
primary
care
physicians
and
other
non-
specialist
healthcare
professionals in Europe, particularly those who do not have ready access

to specialists in pain medicine, on the safe and appropriate use of opioid
medications as part of a multi-faceted approach to pain management, in
properly selected and supervised patients.
1. Introduction
Uncontrolled pain is a major public health concern.
Despite multiple pain management guideline docu-
ments and initiatives by the WHO and others, there
is still a reluctance to apply evidence-based and vali-
dated strategies in pain management. A major ele-
ment contributing to this unacceptable situation is
the pervasive negative bias that exists in respect of
opioid use. In this regard, it is important to state that
we are solely concerned with the legitimate use of
opioid medication by competent and responsible
clinicians,
in
carefully
selected
and
supervised
patients. Opioids are only considered in circum-
stances where non-opioid and adjuvant therapies
have failed. The correct dose of an opioid is the low-
est possible dose that achieves the desired outcome.
The purpose of opioid use, as part of a multi-faceted
approach to pain management, is to achieve and
maintain an optimal level of pain and symptom
relief with the minimal level of side effects. Ulti-
mately, this is intended to rehabilitate the pain
patient so that he/she may again engage more fully
with life across a range of domains – family, work,
social etc.
This guideline document is produced by the Euro-
pean Pain Federation (EFIC) in order to provide a
fair, balanced and evidence-based summary regard-
ing the role of opioid use in pain management. The
guideline is intended primarily for non-specialist pre-
scribers and summarises all of the relevant data
where such exists. Where data are lacking, the views
and expert recommendations presented reflect the
extensive clinical experience of a diverse range of
European clinicians and scientists who have collabo-
rated on this project. In so doing, we hope to better
inform clinicians, regulators, legislators, administra-
tors and the general public. We all have a shared
responsibility to improve the care experience for
patients experiencing pain across Europe.
2. Background
Pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experi-
ence. (IASP Taxonomy 2012) The individual experi-
ence and manifestation of pain is influenced by a
complex series of interactions involving sensory,
pathophysiological,
affective,
socio-cultural,
beha-
vioural and cognitive elements (Fig. 1; Dalal and
Bruera 2012).
Both chronic non-cancer pain and cancer pain
remain significant public health concerns (Breivik
et al., 2006; Ripamomti et al., 2012). The personal

 and socio-economic impact of chronic pain is consid-
ered to be at least as great as that of other estab-
lished healthcare priorities, including cardiovascular
disease
and
cancer
(Breivik
et al.,
2013).
Pain
reduces patient quality of life, preventing many from
leading an independent lifestyle. This can also nega-
tively affect the lives of their family, friends and
co-workers (West et al., 2012). The Declaration of
Montreal states that pain management is inadequate
across most of the world (IASP, 2012).
Opioid analgesics are indispensable for the man-
agement of pain (Gilson et al., 2011). Opioids are
highly effective and safe analgesics and their appro-
priate use by competent clinicians is a crucial ele-
ment in modern pain management. Opioids are not
a panacea for all painful conditions and are only
introduced when strictly necessary and with due
regard to an ongoing risk benefit analysis. Opioids
are not used in isolation, but form part of a multi-
faceted strategy that includes all necessary adjuvant
analgesics,
non-drug
interventions,
psychological
support and rehabilitation. All healthcare profession-
als must be adequately trained in basic pain assess-
ment and management, and must take steps to
maintain
the
essential
competencies
and
skills
required. When deemed medically necessary by a
senior responsible clinician, opioids must be readily
accessible under supervision for those who legiti-
mately require such therapy (Box 1).
3. Pain assessment and screening
In many instances, the absence of systematic screening
of patients for pain results in the under-recognition
and under-treatment of pain. It is over twenty years
since the American Pain Society recommended rou-
tine assessment and recording of patients’ pain as a
first step in improving pain management (APSQoCC,
1995). Whilst identifying pain is no guarantee of
improved pain management, it is a vital first step
(Mularski et al., 2006), and failure to do so means
that pain will not be addressed at all.
All patients undergoing medical assessment for
whatever purpose should be screened for pain. How-
ever, clinicians do not routinely seek a pain history
and patients do not always volunteer one, even
when asked. The reasons for this are summarised in
Boxes 2 and 3 below (Dar et al., 1992; Anderson
et al., 2000, 2002; Cleeland et al., 2000; Anderson,
2010).

Box 2 Why do clinicians not routinely seek a pain history?
• Lack of training and expertise
• Time constraints
• Excessive focus on disease indices
• Not part of standard clinical assessment
• Gender and ethnic differences
Box 1 Chronic pain in Europe – the facts
Chronic pain
• Affects 20% of European citizens
• Disrupts the lives of millions of European citizens and their fam-
ilies
• More common in women
• More common with increasing age
• Negative impact on quality of life, physical and psychological
well-being
• Major economic cost:
○ Indirect (inability to work)
○ Direct (treatment-related costs)
• Grossly under-recognised and under-treated
• Major public health concern
• Access to comprehensive pain assessment and management is
a basic human right
• Coordinated and collaborative approach is urgently required,
particularly in patients whose pain does not respond to stan-
dard therapeutic interventions

Opioid use in chronic pain management
 4. Barriers to appropriate opioid use
Worldwide, one of the most significant barriers to
optimal pain management is lack of access to vital
opioid medications, due to inappropriate restrictions
on their availability and accessibility (INCB, 2016).
Opioids are clearly not a panacea for all pains and
this position paper is solely concerned with the sci-
entific use of opioid medications in selected and
supervised chronic pain patients as part of a compre-
hensive, multi-modality, multi-disciplinary approach
to treatment. In this context alone, opioid therapy is
an essential and indispensable tool in achieving and
maintaining an optimal level of pain control in
selected patients. Due regard must be paid to the
patients psychological and emotional status – there is
always more to achieving and maintaining analgesia
than simply prescribing analgesics. The overall objec-
tive is to enable rehabilitation of the pain patient in
order for them to resume their usual work and lei-
sure activities.
There are enormous variations in opioid use across
the globe, and even within regions, similar variations
are observed. Key barriers to responsible and appro-
priate opioid use identified by the International Nar-
cotics Control Board are shown in Box 4 (INCB,
2016).
According
to
the
World
Health
Organization
(WHO): ‘the central principle of balance represents a
dual obligation of governments to establish a system
of control that ensures adequate availability of con-
trolled substances for medical and scientific purposes,
while simultaneously preventing abuse, diversion
and trafficking. While misuse of controlled sub-
stances poses a risk to society, the system of control
is not intended to be a barrier to their availability for
medical and scientific purposes, nor interfere in their
legitimate
medical
use
for
patient
care’
(WHO,
2011).
A measure of the average per capita consumption
of opioids in a given country is not in itself a reliable
quality indicator of pain management in that coun-
try, yet it does provide some indirect evidence of the
awareness among healthcare professionals of the role
of opioids in pain management. Although a signifi-
cant cumulative increase in opioid use has been
reported in recent years, this has mainly occurred in
a selected limited number of developed countries.
Access to opioids varies enormously with the greatest
use noted in North America, Western Europe and
Oceania. Ninety-two per cent of the world’s mor-
phine is consumed by 17% of the world’s popula-
tion, leaving a mere 8% for distribution amongst
83%
of
the
world’s
population.
Consequently,
millions
of
people
are
allowed
to
suffer
pain
unnecessarily. (INCB, 2016). Cherny et al. note that
throughout Europe there are ‘excessively zealous or
poorly considered laws and regulations to restrict the
diversion of medicinal opioids into illicit markets pro-
foundly interfere with the medical availability of opi-
oids for the relief of pain. Often, the logistics of the
treatment of pain with opioids is so burdensome or
complex for physicians, nurses or pharmacists as to be
a major disincentive to involvement’ (Cherny et al.,
2010).
The solution to this major public health issue does
not rest solely with any one country, professional
group or other constituency. All concerned must
work together to implement in a meaningful way
the recommendations of the WHO (WHO, 2011) and
the Council of Europe (CoE, 2003) in respect of opi-
oid availability and accessibility for legitimate medi-
cal
and
scientific
purposes.
The
European
Pain
Federation (EFIC) believes that a clearly focused,
balanced and coordinated approach at local, regional,
national and international level is required if we are
Box 3 Why do patients not always report pain, even if asked?
• May believe that pain is inevitable
• Pain may not be the primary symptom
• Cognitive impairment
• Regard pain as an unavoidable consequence of their disease
and/or treatment
• Wish to be seen in a positive way
• Do not wish to challenge the position of the clinician
• Fearful of the anticipated consequences:
○ Hospitalisation/investigations
○ Anticipated therapies, including opioid medications
Box 4 Barriers to responsible and appropriate opioid use
• Unnecessarily strict rules and regulations have created an
impediment to providing adequate access of populations to
certain controlled medications
• The negative perception about controlled drugs among medical
professionals and patients has limited their rational use
• Lack of economic means and insufficient resources have
resulted in inadequate medical treatment, including the use of
narcotic drugs
• Major differences in opioid use (class, type, administration and
dose) between countries and clinicians, as well as lack of uni-
form guidelines in Europe, have restricted the use in some
countries to selected drugs. This neglects the individual differ-
ences in response to different opioids

 to address the gross inequities that currently exist.
There is an urgent need to shift the focus from a
predominantly opioid-centric approach to a more
patient-centric approach.
5. Opioids: separating fact from fallacy
Unfortunately, despite all of the available research,
extensive clinical experience and published evidence,
unjustified and exaggerated concerns regarding the
safety of opioids continue to serve as a significant
impediment to their appropriate availability, accessi-
bility and rational use (INCB, 2016).
For absolute clarity, the observations made in this
article concerning the use of opioids relate exclusively
to the medical use of opioid medications in adequately
assessed and supervised patients for the sole purpose of
achieving and maintaining a satisfactory level of pain
and symptom control and are based on the strict under-
standing and implementation of the core principles of
opioid prescribing that are summarised in Box 5 below.
Table 1 summarises some of the most commonly
encountered misconceptions concerning opioid use
and highlights some of the key facts necessary to
understanding the unique role of opioid medications
in clinical practice.
There
is
marked
inter-individual
variability
in
responsiveness to different opioids, both in terms of
analgesic benefit and toxicity (de Stoutz et al., 1995;
Drewes et al., 2013). Aside from molecular, pharma-
cological, genetic and phenotypic factors there are
various l-opioid receptors sub-types, which may
explain, at least in part, the variation in observed
clinical responses (Gretton and Droney, 2014).
6. Clinical pharmacology of opioids
There are three classical types of G-protein coupled
opioid receptors: d-, j- and l-receptors. Opioids act
at these receptors as agonists, antagonists or partial
agonists. Opioid agonists bind to the receptors to
induce cellular hyperpolarisation. The majority of
Table 1 Common misconceptions and hard facts about opioids.
Opioid Misconceptions ✗
(1) Opioids are inherently dangerous ✗
(2) Opioids inevitably shorten life and hasten death ✗
(3) Opioid use is associated with significant tolerance ✗
(4) Opioid use invariably results in addiction ✗
(5) Opioids cause clinically significant respiratory depression ✗

Opioid facts U
(1) Opioids are indispensable in our approach to pain management – there are no equivalent alternatives. U
(2) Opioids are both safe and effective when used appropriately by adequately trained clinicians as part of an overall multi-faceted pain and symp-
tom management strategy in selected and supervised patients. U
(3) Opioids do not have any influence whatsoever on the timing of a person’s death that is arising from the natural, predictable and unavoidable
consequences of his or her pathology(ies). U
(4) Withholding or withdrawing opioids will not cause a person to live any longer, but will impact negatively on his/her overall level of comfort
and quality of life for the duration of his/her natural life. U
(5) Physical dependence is routinely observed and therefore dose adjustments should be made gradually. Physical dependence must not be confused
with psychological dependence (addiction). U
(6) In a routine clinical context, problems such as respiratory depression, tolerance and addiction are rarely encountered, and should not act as a
barrier to legitimate opioid use. U
(7) Opioid induced bowel dysfunction is the most common and problematic issue associated with opioid use and must be proactively managed.
In this regard, the use of a mechanism-based strategy involving the prescription laxatives and/or specific opioid antagonists is particularly rec-
ommended. U
(8) There is marked inter-individual variation in the response to different opioids. Hence, a variety of different opioids in a range of formulations
are required. U
(9) There is no one single opioid that is preferred over all others and is most suitable for all patients and in all circumstances. U
(10) When misused or abused opioids have the potential to cause harm including patient death. In this regard, opioids are no different to many
other commonly prescribed medications. U

Opioid use in chronic pain management
 clinically relevant opioid analgesics are agonists of l-
receptors in the central nervous system (Pathan and
Williams, 2012).
Opioids mainly elicit their analgesic action through
binding to central l-opioid receptors. Opioid-related
side effects are mediated via both central and periph-
eral l-opioid receptors. Genetic variability in l-
opioid
receptors,
complex
regulation
of
receptor
expression, different binding affinities of the opioids,
and additional j- and d-opioid receptors all con-
tribute to the need for individualisation of pain treat-
ment (Brunton et al., 2011).
The majority of patients respond to low or moder-
ate doses of opioids. The non-specialist prescriber
should seek expert opinion if a patient needs rapidly
escalating doses and/or if the effective dose is in
excess of oral morphine equivalent of 120 mg/24 h.
Table 2 presents pharmacological data on common
opioids, including the dose equivalent to 30 mg mor-
phine (Brunton et al., 2011; DrugBank 2015). Please
note that tables of equivalence are intended as a
guideline only and do not represent clinically precise
equivalence.
Further
dosing
guidance
can
be
obtained using one of a number of opioid dosage
conversion apps that are available for smartphones
and tablets (Haffey et al., 2013).
7. Guidelines for initiating opioid
analgesia
The decision to initiate opioid therapy is made by a
senior responsible clinician following a comprehen-
sive assessment of the individual patient and a
detailed analysis of the nature of the pain and its
impact. For chronic non-cancer pain, opioid therapy
is only initiated when more simple strategies have
failed following a reasonable trial. All patients must
be fully informed on the proposed therapeutic strat-
egy, including all potential risks and benefits and
must be educated on the appropriate use and storage
of the opioid medication. It is good practice at the
outset to identify and document the expected thera-
peutic outcomes, both favourable in terms of pain
Box 5 Clarification of medical use of opioid medications in ade-
quately assessed and supervised patients
(1) All patients presenting with pain are adequately assessed by
competent clinicians and a management strategy is devised
and implemented with due regard to best international prac-
tice
(2) All prescribing clinicians are familiar with pain assessment
techniques and management guidelines, including the safe
and effective use of opioid medications
(3) Non-specialist prescribers must be able to refer patients for
specialist opinion, that will be undertaken within a reasonable
time-frame by a specialist multi-disciplinary pain team
(4) Opioids are prescribed by competent and responsible clini-
cians acting solely in the best interests of patient care
(5) The correct dose of any opioid is the lowest possible dose
that achieves the desired clinical effect with the minimal side-
effect profile
(6) If a satisfactory outcome is achieved, the patient will remain
under close medical surveillance for the duration of opioid
therapy
(7) Opioids, as in the case of all other medications, are initiated
on a trial basis. If a satisfactory response in not achieved
because of inadequate pain control and/or unacceptable bur-
den of side effects, the specific opioid will be safely withdrawn
and alternative options actively explored
(8) Patients and families are fully informed regarding the use and
storage of opioids and are fully supported throughout the
duration of therapy
(9) Opioids are dispensed by competent and responsible pharma-
cists with due regard to local and national regulations and in
accordance with best international practice.
(10) Patients/family members and health care professionals are
expected to engage with each other in a truthful and mutu-
ally respectful manner

Opioid use in chronic pain management
 7.3 Choose an appropriate opioid
a
Opioid selection should be individualized to the
patient. There is no single opioid that is superior to
all other opioids on the individual level and there-
fore opioid therapy is initiated on a trial-and-error
basis. As response cannot be predicted in advance,
physician preference in terms of familiarity and
availability is important and also patient prefer-
ence (where identified) should be respected where
possible. Transdermal opioid delivery systems are
not suitable for patients with acute, uncontrolled
pain. The following shall be taken into considera-
tion when selecting an opioid:
I
Physician/patient preference in terms of famil-
iarity, availability
II
Drug–drug
interactions
and
comorbidities
identified e.g. avoid methadone and buprenor-
phine if history of prolonged QT interval/struc-
tural heart disease/arrhythmia etc.
III No direct clinical trial evidence to suggest any
one opioid is superior to any other in initial
therapy on individual basis. However, some
patients may experience severe side effects to
one opioid and not to another and this cannot

7.6 Treatment of side effects
a
From the beginning, treatment of predictable opi-
oid-induced side effects is an integral part of
effective opioid administration
b
This is particularly relevant in terms of reducing
the burden of opioid induced bowel dysfunction
c
All patients should receive laxative medications
and/or
peripherally

when initiating opioid therapy
d
A smaller proportion of patients will experience
short-term nausea at the initiation of opioid ther-
apy. A dopamine receptor antagonist is useful in
such circumstances.
In summary, the main objective of the short-
term opioid therapy is to find the best balance
between analgesic efficacy and tolerability. That is,
to provide the patient with pain relief, while at
the same time ensuring that they are comfortable
in terms of side effects, with minimal impairment
of physical and psychosocial functional status and
no aberrant drug-related behaviour. Patients need
to be reviewed regularly for signs of inefficacy,
continuous dose escalation, noncompliance, unap-
proved co-medications, deterioration in functional
status or addiction/abuse or misuse. If any such signs
are
seen,
or
there
is
an
unfavourable
balance
between side effects and analgesia, a full re-evaluation
must be undertaken and an alternative therapeutic
strategy pursued.

 8. Opioid switching
In circumstances where an individual patient fails to
achieve satisfactory pain control and/or they are
troubled by unacceptable side effects, a trial of an
alternative opioid is indicated. In clinical practice,
one of two strategies to affect the switch may be
employed as follows:
(1) The equi-analgesic dose of the current opioid
and the proposed new opioid is established by
reference to published equivalence tables. Once
the equivalent dose is established, it is further
reduced by a factor of 25–50% to establish the
new baseline starting dose (Drewes et al., 2013).
This reduction is necessary to allow for incom-
plete cross-tolerance and inter-individual varia-
tion in response. Equivalence tables are for
guidance only as they may underestimate the
potency of the new opioid (Fine and Portenoy,
2009). Fatal outcomes can occur during opioid
rotation, even when prescribers have not devi-
ated from published guidelines (Webster and
Fine, 2012). Once the previous opioid is with-
drawn and the new opioid introduced, the clini-
cian will continue to monitor the patient and
will
titrate
the
dose
as
required,
based
on
observed clinical response.
(2) Alternatively, the dose of the established opioid
may be reduced sequentially over a number of
days
and
stopped.
Simultaneously,
the
new
opioid
is
introduced
at
the
lowest
possible
dose and gradually titrated over a number of
days to the optimal dose that achieves a satis-
factory outcome with an acceptable side-effect
burden.
9. Assessment and management of
short-term opioid side effects
9.1 Opioid-induced constipation or opioid-
induced bowel dysfunction
In humans, l-, d- and j-opioid receptors are present
in the gastrointestinal tract, and enteric neurones
synthesize
endogenous
opioid
peptides
(Holzer,
2009). Activation of enteric opioid receptors by
exogenous
opioid
analgesics
results
in
increased
intestinal tone together with decreased and uncoor-
dinated motility, decreased secretion from the intes-
tine and associated organs, and increased tone of the
sphincters (Holzer, 2004). This is known as opioid-
induced constipation (OIC), and defined as a change
when initiating opioid therapy from baseline bowel
habits (over 7 days) characterized by any of the fol-
lowing (Camilleri et al., 2014):
• Reduced bowel movement frequency
• Development or worsening of straining to pass
bowel movements
• Sense of incomplete rectal evacuation
• Harder stool consistency
However, because opioid receptors are present
throughout
the
gastrointestinal
tract,
these
symptoms are not restricted to the colon. Hence, opi-
oid-induced bowel dysfunction (OIBD) is a more
accurate description. OIBD includes symptoms such
as dry mouth, gastro-oesophageal reflux, vomiting,
bloating,
abdominal
pain,
anorexia,
hard
stool,
delayed
digestion
(constipation)
and
incomplete
evacuation (Pappagallo, 2001; Brock et al., 2012). In
placebo
trials,
OIC
occurs
in
11%
of
patients,
whereas in non-cancer and cancer patients treated
with opioids prevalence ranges from 33–94% (Kalso
et al., 2004; Bell et al., 2009; Tuteja et al., 2010;
Key points
• There are six main steps for initiating opioid
therapy:
• Step 1: Determine whether opioid therapy is
suitable for the patient.
• Step 2: Define the desired goals of opioid treat-
ment.
• Step 3: Choose an appropriate opioid therapy.
• Step 4: Initiate a short-term trial with the cho-
sen opioid and concurrently introduce bowel
protection
• Step 5: Titrate the opioid dose up from the
lowest possible starting dose.
• Step 6: Aim to achieve a favourable balance
between analgesia and side effects.
Key points
• When switching opioids, safe use of an opioid
equi-analgesic dose table involves two steps:
• Step 1: Establish the equi-analgesic dose of the
two opioids by reference to published guideli-
nes
• Step 2: Reduce the starting dose of the new
opioid by a further factor of 25–50% to allow
for inter-individual variation in response and
the phenomenon of incomplete cross-tolerance.
An additional dose adjustment may be neces-
sary based on the individual patient character-
istics.

T. O’Brien et al.
Opioid use in chronic pain management
 Dorn et al., 2014), and unlike other side effects of
opioids, OIBD does not resolve over time (Akbarali
et al., 2014).
Prophylaxis against OIBD is the recommended
treatment because there is little evidence that life-
style changes and fibres improve symptoms (Dorn
et al., 2014). Laxatives are recommended as first-line
treatment although their efficacy is generally mini-
mal (Brenner and Chey, 2014) and may explain the
high opioid discontinuation rates in patients with GI
effects (Bell et al., 2009). Opioid rotation may be
helpful in reducing OIBD (Webster and Fine, 2012;
Drewes et al., 2013), and some opioids with effects
on the noradrenergic system (e.g. tapentadol) may
preserve analgesic effects with fewer side effects (Xu
et al., 2012).
Another approach is to use opioid antagonists
whose effects are strictly limited or ‘compartmenta-
lised’ to the gut. Because there are no significant
levels of the anatagonist in the systemic circulation,
central analgesia is maintained (Diego et al., 2011;
Brenner and Chey, 2014; Leppert, 2014). One such
example is an oral, prolonged-release formulation that
combines the agonist oxycodone in a fixed 2:1 ratio
with naloxone. Negligible amounts of naloxone reach
the systemic circulation because of extensive first-pass
metabolism in the liver. Hence, this formulation is not
suitable for patients with significant hepatic impair-
ment. (Leppert, 2014). The effect has been shown to
be superior to placebo and laxatives in four RCTs
totalling 974 patients, and in which the primary out-
come was the Bowel Function Index (Simpson et al.,
2008; Lowenstein et al., 2009; Meissner et al., 2009;
Ahmedzai et al., 2012).
Another approach is the use of peripherally acting l-
opioid receptor antagonists such as the subcutaneously
administered methylnaltrexone and the oral tablet
naloxegol. Naloxegol was investigated in two RCTs
where bowel function improved, whereas pain inten-
sity and opioid requirements were unchanged, and no
withdrawal symptoms or serious cardiovascular events
were observed. Moreover, upper gastrointestinal dys-
functions improved (Webster et al., 2013; Chey et al.,
2014; Poulsen et al., 2015).
A Cochrane review on the use of laxatives and
peripherally acting mu opioid receptor antagonists
for the management of constipation in palliative care
patients found insufficient evidence to support laxa-
tive use because of a paucity of randomized con-
trolled
trials.
However,
there
is
evidence
demonstrating the efficacy of peripherally acting mu
opioid receptor antagonists in inducing laxation in
palliative care patients with opioid induced constipa-
tion where laxatives have failed. As this is a rela-
tively new therapeutic strategy, longer term safety
data are required (Candy et al., 2011). A recent con-
sensus review from Scandinavia has outlined the pit-
falls in OIBD (Drewes et al., 2016) and an adopted
treatment algorithm is shown in Fig. 3.
9.2 Opioid-induced emesis
Opioid-induced nausea and vomiting are experi-
enced by up to 40% of pain patients with no his-
tory
of
emesis.
However,
because
this
is
an
inconsistent consequence of opioid therapy, pro-
phylactic antiemetics are not generally prescribed.
A systematic review (Laugsand et al., 2011) found
nine studies with relief of opioid-induced nausea
and vomiting as the primary outcome, only two of
which reported efficacy following high-dose meto-
clopramide treatment. Fifty studies of low quality

Bowel Function Index may be used, where a score >30 should lead to more intensive treatment.

 included nausea and/or vomiting as secondary out-
comes; these indicated that emesis could be allevi-
ated by opioid dose reduction, switching opioid
therapy, or changing route of administration (e.g.
oral to transdermal or parenteral). It is recom-
mended
that
some
antidopaminergic
drugs
(e.g.
haloperidol, domperidone) and other agents with
antidopaminergic and additional modes of action
(e.g.
metoclopramide)
are
used
to
treat
opioid-
induced emesis. However, it should be borne in
mind
that
domperidone
can
cause
cardiotoxic
effects
that
prolong
the
QT
interval
(GOV.UK,
2014). Moreover, high-dose and/or long-term use
of
metoclopramide
may
cause
short-term
extrapyramidal
disorders
and
tardive
dyskinesia
(GOV.UK, 2013). It is therefore recommended that
domperidone and metoclopramide are administered
at the lowest effective dose for the shortest possi-
ble time.
9.3 Opioid-related central nervous system side
effects
Opioid-related
CNS
side
effects
can
be
sepa-
rated into symptoms and signs associated with a
lowering
level
of
consciousness
(e.g.
sedation
and
drowsiness),
cognitive
and
psychomotor
impairment,
and
hyperexcitability
reactions
(e.g.
hallucinations, myoclonus and hyperalgesia) (Vella-
Brincat and
Macleod,
2007). In
all
cases, it
is
recommended that the opioid dose is lowered, and
also to check for precipitating causes such as renal
dysfunction. If a dose reduction is ineffective or
poorly tolerated, then a careful re-evaluation of
opioid
choice
and
other
analgesic
options
is
required. In patients with opioid-related neurotoxi-
city (delirium, hallucination, myoclonus and hyper-
algesia), dose reduction or opioid switching should
be considered. Recent case reports suggest a possi-
ble neurotoxic effect of opioids that manifests as a
subjective disturbance in auditory function. This is
typically
described
as
a
subjective
sensation
of
‘blocked ears’ or an experience reported as similar
to what sometimes occurs when descending in an
aircraft (Cran et al., 2014).
10. Managing long-term use of opioids
Patients on long-term opioid therapy must be kept
under close clinical surveillance. At all times, the
opioid dose is kept to the minimal level that achieves
the desired outcome. Equally, side effects must be
kept under review, especially in terms of bowel
dysfunction (which is not dose-dependent and is the
only opioid side effect with a mechanism-based ther-
apy). As with any other medication, opioid therapy
should only continue if it is clinically beneficial, with
an acceptable side-effect profile that does not further
compromise patient quality of life.
Long-term opioid treatment of up to 6 months will
benefit approximately 25% of patients with painful
conditions such as osteoarthritis, diabetic polyneu-
ropathy, postherpetic neuralgia and chronic low back
pain (H€
auser et al., 2014). In such patients, regular
clinical reviews are required to assess pain control,
impact on lifestyle (daily activities, sleep disturbance
and participation), physical and psychological well-
being, side effects and continued need for treatment
(H€
auser et al., 2014).
After 6 months of opioid therapy, a dose reduction
(or
‘drug
holiday’)
should
be
considered
and
Key points
• OIBD is caused by blockade of different enteric
opioid receptors, resulting in decreased gut
motility and secretion and reduced sphincter
tone.
• OIBD is a whole gut syndrome. Symptoms
include constipation, as well as dry mouth, gas-
tro-oesophageal
reflux,
vomiting,
bloating,
abdominal pain, anorexia, hard stool, delayed
digestion and incomplete evacuation.
• OIBD can be managed prophylactically with
laxatives,
by
opioid
rotation,
or
by
opioid
antagonists with effects restricted to the gut
(e.g. a combination of prolonged-release oxy-
codone plus naloxone).
• Up to 40% of pain patients treated with opioids
experience emesis.
• Opioid-induced emesis is alleviated by opioid
dose reduction, opioid rotation, changing route
of administration or treatment with an anti-
dopaminergic drug (e.g. haloperidol) or an
antidopaminergic drug with additional modes
of action (e.g. metoclopramide).
• Opioid-related CNS side effects include seda-
tion, drowsiness, cognitive and psychomotor
impairment,
hallucinations,
myoclonus
and
hyperalgesia.
• Opioid-related CNS side effects should be man-
aged by dose reduction and/or opioid switch-
ing, and patients checked for underlying causes
(e.g. renal dysfunction).

Opioid use in chronic pain management
 discussed with the patient, to determine whether
continued opioid treatment is appropriate (H€
auser
et al.,2015). The response to non-pharmacological
treatment, such as pain-related physiotherapy, psy-
chotherapy
and
systematic
lifestyle
modification,
should also be assessed (H€
auser et al.,2015). Discon-
tinuation of opioid therapy should be considered if
the individual goals of treatment are not met; if side
effects are intolerable and/or untreatable; if the indi-
vidual goals are reached by additional treatment
(e.g. surgery or physiotherapy); or if the patient
shows signs of opioid misuse, abuse or addiction
(H€
auser et al.,2014). In relation to the latter point,
using opioids for pain control in drug-dependent
patients is complex and should always prompt refer-
ral to a specialist service.
A situation may arise where the clinician decides
that discontinuing opioids is required, but the patient
disagrees and seeks to continue the therapy. It may be
difficult for the clinician to determine if the patient’s
insistence represents a genuine desire for pain relief,
inappropriate drug seeking behaviour or a combina-
tion of both (Alford, 2016). In such circumstances, the
clinician is the responsible prescriber and must be fully
satisfied that continued opioid prescription is the cor-
rect management strategy. If not, the decision must be
respectfully explained to the patient that opioid pre-
scriptions are to be withdrawn. Other therapeutic
options and more specialist multi-disciplinary assess-
ment should be undertaken in such circumstances.
11. The use of opioids in special
populations
Opioids should always be considered in selected
chronic pain patients, irrespective of their underlying
co-morbidities. However, additional care must be
taken when choosing the appropriate type and dose
of opioid, particularly in patients with renal or hep-
atic insufficiency.
11.1 Renal insufficiency
In
patients
with
renal
insufficiency,
changes
in
response to opioids can result from impaired excre-
tion (and thus accumulation of the parent opioid
and/or its metabolites), changes in acid base balance,
protein levels, volume of distribution and absorption.
The impairment of excretion increases in line with
renal dysfunction and might be predicted by esti-
mates of the glomerular filtration rate.
Opioids that are transformed to analgesic active or
toxic metabolites and are dependent on the kidneys
for excretion should be avoided. Based on available
pharmacokinetic data, the opioids that are least
likely to cause harm to patients with real insuffi-
ciency are: fentanyl, buprenorphine and oxymor-
phone. Opioids to be used with caution in this
special population are hydromorphone and oxy-
codone. Patients with renal insufficiency should gen-
erally
not
be
prescribed
codeine,
morphine,
pethidine, dextropropoxyphene and tramadol (Coller
et al., 2009; King et al., 2015; Tawfic and Belling-
ham, 2015).
11.2 Hepatic insufficiency
In patients with hepatic insufficiency, changes in
response to opioids can result from altered pharma-
cokinetics.
Portosystemic
shunting
may
decrease
first-pass metabolism and increase systemic bioavail-
abilty, and distribution may alter due to decreased
production of drug-binding enzymes, or changes in
body composition. Furthermore, rate of metabolism
may decrease due to altered activity and capacity of
the metabolizing enzymes, cytochrome P450 (CYP)
and
uridine
50-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase
(UGT); CYP activity is affected more than UGT
activity.
The impairment of opioid metabolism increases
in line with increased liver dysfunction. Changes
are most pronounced in cirrhotic patients. Little if
any changes are seen in patients with chronic liver
diseases without a significant fibrosis component.
Dose
adjustment
and
other
precautions
are
Key points
• Regular clinical reviews are required for long-
term (≥26 weeks) opioid therapy, to assess pain
control, impact on lifestyle, physical and psy-
chological well-being, side effects and contin-
ued need for treatment.
• A ‘drug holiday’ should be considered after
6 months of opioid therapy, and additional non-
pharmacological treatments should be explored.
• Discontinuation of opioid therapy should be
considered if treatment goals are not met, side
effects are intolerable/untreatable, if additional
non-pharmacological treatments are effective
alone, or there are signs of opioid misuse,
abuse or addiction.
• Using opioids for pain control in drug-depen-
dent patients is complex and should always
prompt referral to a specialist service.

 therefore only relevant in severe liver diseases. Of
note, however, is the fact routine
liver function
tests are not necessarily a reliable index of the
severity of underlying liver fibrosis and portosyste-
mic
shunting.
Opioids
that
require
a
prolonged
dose interval or a dose reduction are tramadol,
tapentadol, morphine, hydromorphone and oxyco-
done. Codeine and pethidine should be avoided in
patients with hepatic impairment (Tegeder et al.,
1999; Bosilkovska et al., 2012).
11.3 Opioid use in patients at risk of drug
abuse
Numerous assessment tools are available to assess
drug-seeking behaviour (Chou et al., 2009; Atluri
et al., 2012), although the majority have method-
ological flaws making them unsuitable for screening
patients before initiating chronic opioid therapy.
However, the Screener and Opioid Assessment for
Patients with Pain-Revised (SOAPP-R) tool is reason-
ably effective in conjunction with clinical assessment
(Chou et al., 2009).
Three other useful tools to assess risk of inappro-
priate prescription opioid use are the Addiction
Behaviours Checklist (ABC) (Wu et al., 2006), the
Diagnosis, Intractability, Risk and Efficacy (DIRE)
score (Belgrade et al., 2006), and the six-criteria
screening tool created by Atluri and
Sudarshan
(Atluri and Sudarshan, 2004). All three are valid
tests based on highly objective questions (Atluri
et al., 2012). For patients suspected of being at
high risk of inappropriate opioid use, urine drug
screens, prescription monitoring programs and dose
limitations
are
options
to
prevent
abuse/misuse
(Atluri et al., 2012). The most important aspect of
this discussion is the fact that doctors are not
treating
pain
per
se,
but
are
treating
patients.
Hence, it is vital that doctors take time to get to
know and understand their patient, so that their
therapeutic relationship is built on mutual respect,
honesty and trust. Legitimate opioids treatment in
patients at risk of abuse should generally be con-
sidered a specialist task.
11.4 Opioid use while driving or working
There is a clear relationship between the illicit use or
abuse of opioids and fatal car crashes (Dubois et al.,
2010; Corsenac et al., 2012; Reguly et al., 2014;
Wilson et al., 2014), which has led to laws across
Europe limiting opioid use while driving or working.
However, research conducted over the last 20 years
indicates that patients on stable doses of prescribed
opioids for legitimate clinical purposes show little, if
any, impairment to their driving skills (Vainio et al.,
1995; Sabatowski et al., 2003, 2014; Dagtekin et al.,
2007; Amato et al., 2013). The key is for patients to
be on stable opioid therapy of at least 5–7 days’
duration, and ensuring that no other psychoactive
drugs are being taken concomitantly (Kress and
Kraft, 2005). The International Association for the
Study of Pain (IASP) advises that opioid analgesics
should be used with caution when combined with
CNS
depressant
drugs
such
as
benzodiazepines.
(IASP, 2015).
Physicians prescribing opioids should ensure that
their patients are well-informed of the risks and ben-
efits. Despite the scientific data suggesting minimal
impact on driving ability, a patient’s decision to drive
or use machinery remains theirs alone, and caution
is advised. With long-term opioid use, prescription
changes should be handled by a single physician or
team who should reiterate the risks and benefits and
explain the need for additional caution in the days
and weeks following the change. Use of a well-
informed, written consent form is recommended for
these purposes.
11.5 Educational requirements to prescribe
opioids
Education on pain management and opioid use
must begin at undergraduate level. In Europe there
appears to be a lack of education about pain, both
at undergraduate level in medical schools and dur-
ing residency training. The APPEAL study, which

Opioid use in chronic pain management
 involved 242 undergraduate medical schools in 15
EU countries, found that 82% of schools did not
have
dedicated
pain
management
courses
that
were compulsory for all students (EFIC, 2013a). To
begin to address this, in 2013 the EFIC published
the Pain Management Core Curriculum for Euro-
pean Medical Schools, which encourages both stu-
dents
and
medical
schools
to
be
gain
in-depth
knowledge and training about pain management
(EFIC, 2013b). In conjunction with this curricu-
lum, the EFIC offers a Diploma of Pain Medicine
in order to better provide up-to-date knowledge,
thinking and management, as well as to allow
sharing of best practice amongst European clini-
cians involved in pain treatment. The Diploma is
multidisciplinary, recognising that no single health-
care professional will have all the necessary train-
ing and skills to treat all patients across the pain
spectrum.
Knowledge
of
the
curriculum,
pain
assessment and treatment skills are first evaluated
by a multiple choice examination questionnaire.
This is followed by a series of objective structured
clinical examinations, which test clinical skill per-
formance and competence in modalities such as
communication, clinical examination and diagnosis
and treatment planning, including referral to col-
leagues for appropriate management. The present
review will be included in the recommended read-
ing list for the EFIC’s curriculum.
However, more needs to be done in this direc-
tion. A positive and comprehensive educational pro-
gramme
is
needed
to
change
attitudes
on
the
medical use of opioids, extending from the core cur-
riculum of medical students to patients taking opi-
oids, as well as their families and employers. This
education should cover the rules governing opioid
use, the management of their side-effects and, most
importantly, an unequivocal, evidence-based mes-
sage from governments highlighting issues relating
to abuse and misuse, but distinguishing them from
appropriate medical use. The need for training in the
correct use of opioids is multifaceted. Education
would include drug–drug interactions, safe dosing,
how to transition from one medication to another,
how to monitor and look for signs of abuse, pharma-
cokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and how to use one’s
state prescription monitoring program. The EFIC
organises Pain Schools, which are continuing medi-
cal education (CME) courses aimed at young Euro-
pean medical doctors. These would be the ideal
setting to provide specialist training to enable PCPs
to confidently and safely prescribe opioid analgesics
to patients with chronic pain conditions.
12. Conclusions
Pain is a global public health problem. In Europe, the
reasons are many and varied but ultimately relate to a
lack of understanding of the nature and impact of
chronic pain and a failure to apply evidence based
strategies to pain management. The situation is fur-
ther
compounded
by
an
inappropriate
and
Key points
• PCPs must clearly explain the potential risks of
driving or working while taking opioids.
• Avoid
co-prescription
of
other
psychoactive
drugs,
or
a
change
in
current
prescribed
dosage, without a further explanation of the
potential risks to the patients
• Regularly monitor therapy and ensure any
changes in the prescription is made by the
same physician, or the same team.
Alford (Alford, 2016) highlights the need for
prescriber
education
which
he
believes
will
‘empower clinicians to make appropriate, well-
informed decisions about whether to initiate,
continue, modify or discontinue opioid treatment
for individual patients at each clinical encounter.
Education has the power to both reduce overpre-
scribing and ensure that patients in need retain
access to opioids’.
Key points
• In Europe there is currently a lack of education
about pain in medical schools or during resi-
dency training.
• Training should include drug–drug interactions,
safe dosing, how to transition from one medi-
cation to another, how to monitor and look for
signs of abuse, pharmacokinetics, pharmacody-
namics, and how to use one’s state prescription
monitoring program.
• Policies need to be developed to encourage
education of practitioners to ensure they take
the necessary precautions to prescribe opioid
analgesics responsibly.
• The EFIC is committed to providing such edu-
cation through its Pain Schools CME courses.

Opioid use in chronic pain management
T. O’Brien et al.
 exaggerated fear concerning the legitimate scientific
use of opioid medications as part of a comprehensive
pain management strategy in carefully selected and
supervised patients. In many countries, overly strin-
gent and ill-considered restrictions and regulations
intended to prevent illicit, non-medical use of opioids,
results in patients suffering unnecessarily. Opioids
should only be introduced when less potent analgesics
and adjuvant therapies have failed to achieve and
maintain adequate pain relief and rehabilitation. A
positive educational programme is required to change
attitudes towards the proper medical use of opioids,
both in the medical community and for patients, their
families and wider society. The European Pain Federa-
tion (EFIC) is committed to improving the under-
standing of opioids and their role in pain management,
and believes that appropriate education and training
will enable PCPs to prescribe opioids responsibly.
The medical profession is compassionate enough
and bright enough to learn how to prescribe opioids
when they are indicated in ways that maximise ben-
efit and minimise harm. Though managing chronic
pain is complicated and time-consuming, we owe it
to our patients to ensure access to comprehensive
pain management, including the medically appropri-
ate use of opioids (Alford, 2016).
