Abstract 
As the prevalence of tobacco smoking has been decreasing, obesity has increased. 
Obesity is set to overtake tobacco smoking in many developed countries as the primary 
preventable cause of conditions such as diabetes, cancer and heart disease. Obesity is 
a complex condition that is challenging public health prevention efforts. Tobacco 
smoking mitigates weight gain through nicotine’s effect on the brain and metabolism. 
The prospect of gaining weight upon stopping smoking acts as an inhibitor to quitting 
and weight gain post-cessation is a common cause of relapse. Vaping nicotine is a new 
and controversial phenomenon that is highly attractive to smokers, but raises fears for 
health among public health and tobacco control advocates. There have been some 
reports among vapers that vaping is helping to mitigate weight gain after stopping 
smoking and or vaping is helping them to control their weight. There are several 
potential mechanisms by which vaping, in addition to the direct effects of nicotine, could 
facilitate weight control, these include taste perception, physical mouth feel and 
sensation and behavioural replacement. Research on the potential for vaping to support 
weight control may be worth pursuing given the human and economic costs of the global 
obesity epidemic and the failure of current obesity prevention strategies.

Introduction 
The top three leading causes of morbidity and mortality in virtually every country in the 
world are smoking, high blood pressure and obesity (1). Smoking tobacco is still the 
largest preventable cause of death and disease. An estimated 400 million adults 
worldwide will be killed by smoking between 2010 and 2050 (2). The obesity epidemic, 
however, is fast becoming one of the world’s largest health problems with prevalence 
rates continuing to rise in developed nations (1, 3) despite experimentation with a range 
of policies and interventions.  
 
Obesity is a complex condition (4) that increases an individual’s risk of developing a 
range of non-communicable diseases including type-2 diabetes (T2D), cardiovascular 
disease (CVD) and several forms of cancer (5, 6). Current public health strategies to 
curb obesity focus on food and nutrition policies (7, 8), availability of and access to 
healthier food (9, 10) and community-based interventions (11). However, the 
conventional wisdom that we get fat solely because we consume more energy than we 
expend does not explain the substantial world-wide increase in obesity (3, 12). 
Furthermore, efforts to cure obesity by inducing a negative energy balance, through 
counselling people either to eat less or exercise more, are often ineffective because of 
numerous interconnected physiological, psychological, social and environmental factors 
(13). Progress in obesity management will require greater understanding of the 
biological, behavioural, and environmental factors associated with lifestyle changes (14, 
15). 
 
The use of electronic cigarettes (e-cigs) has been suggested as a possible method to 
combat obesity. The first modern e-cigs were commercialised in 2003 with the sole 
purpose of aiding smoking cessation. However, there may be a side effect of weight 
control for users. E-cigs create a vapour by heating nicotine that is suspended in a liquid 
of propylene glycol and glycerine. When inhaled the vapour provides  the user with a 
'smoking' sensation in their mouth and a throat ‘hit’ familiar to smokers. In addition, the 
associated physical actions of vaping such as lifting the device to the mouth, inhaling 
and exhaling a visible ‘cloud’, mimic actions strongly conditioned with smoking (16). The 
e-liquids used in e-cigs can be bought readymade or as base liquids that can be mixed 
with flavours to suit individual preferences for taste, vapour density, visibility and 
  
3 
 
amount, sensation and nicotine concentration. There are literally thousands of e-liquid 
flavours on the global market. New vapers, who smoke or are switching from smoking 
tobacco, reportedly often start with tobacco flavours but later switch to fruit and other 
food-related flavours (17, 18).  
 
In this article we ask two questions. First, could the use of e-cigs or nicotine vapourisers 
help appetite control, and second, could vaping assist with weight control. If vaping 
could influence either of these, it could play a supportive role in obesity prevention, 
particularly among smokers who stop using combustible tobacco and are at an 
increased risk of weight gain. In order to explore these two questions, however, it is first 
necessary to understand the links between: smoking, nicotine, appetite and weight 
regulation; and how taste, flavour and aroma perception may influence appetite and 
satiety or influence body weight. Understanding these mechanisms provides the 
background for future research that may address practical considerations about the 
potential role of vaping to achieve weight control, especially in smokers who are 
committed to cessation. 
 
Nicotine’s influence on appetite regulation  
Smoking decreases appetite and smokers often report that they smoke to control their 
body weight (19). There is evidence that smoking is causally associated with lower body 
mass index (20) and cessation is frequently followed by rapid weight gain (21). Weight 
gain is a major deterrent to many smokers who want to quit (19, 22). Indeed, the 
significant increase in the prevalence of overweight and obesity in recent years has 
been attributed in part to decreases in smoking prevalence. One analysis suggests that 
up to 14% of the rise in obesity rates could be attributable to the concurrent drop in 
smoking, at least in the USA (23).  
 
The effects of smoking on body weight are caused by the anorexic effect of nicotine in 
tobacco smoke, that is, nicotine decreases food intake (24). Recent studies on weight 
gain after cessation have identified two main pathways (24). The first involves central 
appetite regulatory mechanisms in the brain that are responsible for nicotine’s appetite 
suppressing effect (21, 22).  Nicotine activates nicotinic acetylcholine receptors located 
on pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus. 
  
4 
 
POMC neurons stimulate several agonist and antagonist molecules that activate the 
melanocortin (MC) system involved in regulating food intake, effectively suppressing 
appetite and weight gain. Nicotine exerts its potent action via the brain MC system, and 
the weight gain associated with smoking cessation is due to a reduced activity of MC4 
receptors, thus taking the brake off appetite control. The MC system plays a key role in 
the regulation of appetite and food intake.  
 
The second pathway involves nicotine’s effects on increasing energy expenditure and 
resting metabolic rate (19). Nicotine administration leads to an increase in the metabolic 
rate within minutes of smoking a cigarette (25) and, importantly, energy expenditure is 
reduced with smoking cessation (19, 25). Some of these changes could be modified with 
continued use of nicotine separate from tobacco smoking - through longer term use of 
nicotine replacement therapy, for example, or nicotine-containing e-cigs.  
 
Other mechanisms that may contribute to weight gain after smoking cessation include 
the effects of nicotine on taste and brain reward systems (26, 27). Nicotine modifies 
taste responses (28), and the bitter taste of nicotine may influence food intake through a 
direct action on taste receptors and taste pathways (24).  Nicotine also acts on the brain 
reward systems (29, 30), it influences food reinforcement and hedonic preference as 
well as palatability of food (31). Unfortunately, current pharmacological cessation 
therapies, such as varenicline and bupropion, have not been effective in controlling body 
weight (32). In addition, the plant alkaloid cytisine, a nicotinic agonist that has been used 
as a smoking cessation aid in Eastern Europe, does not alleviate post-cessation weight 
gain (33). 
 
Taste perception, food hedonics and obesity  
High levels of dietary sugars and fats are a main cause of obesity (34). Given that both 
sweetness and fat have a powerful hedonic appeal, preferences for sweet and fatty 
foods are important contributors to increases in body weight and metabolic disease risk 
(35, 36). For example, Ettinger, et al. (37) reported that overweight women had a higher 
detection threshold and lower perception of sweetness than normal weight groups, 
suggesting that overweight women may require higher concentrations to detect 
sweetness and may consume more sugar (38). Similar observations have been reported 
  
5 
 
for fat taste perception, with low-sensitivity fat tasters, who have low oral-intensity 
perception of linoleic acid, inclined to consume more fat and having a higher body mass 
index than high-sensitivity fat tasters (36, 39).  
 
The relationship between oral sensory hedonics and eating preference is well 
established and plays an important role in the design of foods with distinct consumer 
attributes (40).  Recent studies suggest that an individual’s sensitivity for a particular 
taste, flavour or aroma may be linked with specific food choices (41, 42) and may serve 
as a potential risk marker for metabolic disease (43-45). 
 
Taste perception, flavour and aroma influence satiety  
The role of sensory-specific satiety is attracting increasing attention in light of the 
continuing world-wide escalation of overweight and obesity (3).  Sensitivity to sweet and 
fat taste varies considerably between individuals (46, 47). Preference for sweet and fat 
taste is acquired early in life as children learn to like flavours that are energy dense (48, 
49).  Several studies have reported positive associations between the preference for 
sweet and fat taste and the consumption of sugar- and fat-rich foods (43, 50-52), and 
there is increasing interest in delineating the relationships between taste, flavour, aroma 
and satiety. These taste preferences may be important for vaping, where users can 
choose different flavours that could potentially address food cravings, as we explore 
further below.  
 
Research that interrogates how taste and aroma enhance satiation will support the 
development of products that induce or increase the feeling of satiation while reducing 
food intake (53). Such approaches may exploit knowledge about enhanced sensory 
attributes generated through the smell, taste, colour, temperature and mouthfeel of food 
(54). In this respect, the role of taste perception and aroma as sensory triggers of satiety 
mechanisms show considerable promise (55). The proof of principle has been reported 
in several recent human studies demonstrating that the addition of capsaicin to a diet 
enhances anorexigenic sensations, including satiety and fullness (56). Interestingly, 
capsaicin in vaporisers has been found to reduce cravings to smoke, reduce negative 
affect associated with withdrawals and provide satisfaction possibly due to replication of 
respiratory tract sensations associated with smoking tobacco (57). The inclusion of 
  
6 
 
capsaicin in vaping e-liquids could have a role in assisting weight control but well-
designed randomised controlled trials would need to assess this, and efficacy and 
possible modes of actions and mechanism of the observed effect need to be 
determined.  
 
Could vaping assist weight control?  
Within vaper’s forums, the notion of vaping with or without nicotine, for weight control 
has arisen. Petitioners against vaping restrictions have also cited weight control as a 
potential benefit of vaping (58). Participants in a recent trial of vaping for smoking 
cessation did not report significant weight gain in the longer term (at one year post quit 
date) when compared with continuing smokers and reducers (59). In addition, only two 
participants cited appetite control as a main reason for initiating vaping in a large 
international survey, but more importantly 28 said vaping helped them control their 
weight/appetite; 37 said it helps with controlling weight and sugar cravings; 27 claimed 
they had experienced weight loss as a result of starting to vape; eight had increased 
weight; five experienced a decrease in their blood sugar levels (T2D) and three had 
reduced cholesterol levels (60).  
 
Could vaping assist appetite control? 
It is already established that nicotine has appetite suppressant actions in the MC system 
and assists glucose metabolism, as outlined above.  It is also well known that some 
people practising dietary restraint may use smoking to attenuate food cravings. If vapour 
delivers similar or as effective levels of nicotine, these actions could be expected to be 
retained. Animal studies comparing the effects on weight following exposure to tobacco 
smoke and e-cig vapour generated conflicting results. One study using neonatal mice 
found reduced weight for both tobacco smoke and e-cig vapour (61) and another study 
reported that effects on body weight occurred only in the group exposed to tobacco 
smoke (62).  Ritualistic behaviours, for example, mixing one’s own liquids, putting the 
parts of the e-cig together (reminiscent of cigarette rolling), filling the e-cig and the act of 
vaping may, like smoking, also be used as an alternative to the act of eating. However, 
vaping could have unique properties in that the smell, taste and mouth feel created by 
flavoured vapour could play a role in mitigating food cravings.  
 
  
7 
 
Vaping is not without risks, although evidence to date suggests that it is much safer than 
continued tobacco smoking (63, 64). Concerns have been expressed about the 
constituents of some flavourings although to date these have not been formally explored 
in trials with people. Trace or very low levels of toxic contaminants have been detected 
in some flavoured e-liquids with some studies suggesting that the level of diacetyl in 
particular e-liquids has potential to be harmful even when present at levels 100 times 
lower than in tobacco smoke (65). Questions also remain about long term use and 
potential health consequences, for example of the irritant effect of vapour on the 
respiratory system (66).  
 
Conclusion 
E-cigs may have promise for smoking cessation and could play a valuable role in 
reducing preventable deaths by contributing to reductions in smoking prevalence. 
Obesity is set to overtake tobacco smoking in many developed countries as the primary 
preventable cause of conditions such as diabetes, cancer and CVD. It is possible that e-
cigs could contribute to reductions in overweight and obesity alongside reducing 
smoking. More research on the potential of e-cigs to reduce disease risks is needed, 
and investigation of any potential role they may play in mitigating weight gain is a viable 
topic for future study.   
 
Several lines of investigation are worth pursuing. First, studies with vapers should 
explore the perceived benefits in terms of weight control and document vaping use for 
this perceived purpose. Observational follow-up studies could usefully track if vaping 
'weight-controllers' are all ex-smokers and whether they are hoping to mitigate post-
cessation weight gain, or whether there are any ex- or never smokers adopting vaping 
specifically for this purpose, and if so why? Further questions include whether nicotine is 
used in e-liquids and at what concentration and frequency? The existing known 
usefulness of nicotine for suppressing weight gain (67) plus vaper reports of e-cig use 
for weight control would suggest that the use of vaping with nicotine and without nicotine 
has to be formally tested in a randomised controlled trial. Trials of vaping for smoking 
cessation are presently occurring but there are no known registered trials of smoking 
cessation via vaping specifically for people who are overweight or obese and who are 
concerned about further weight gain. Further questions include: are particular flavours 
perceived to be more useful than others, and if so why? Furthermore, well-designed 
  
8 
 
studies using human volunteers could formally test the effect of vaping specific e-liquids 
on satiety and investigate the role of taste, smell, sensation of inhaling vapour as well as 
the volume of vapour and mouth feel. Interestingly, some vapers perceive vegetable 
glycerine to be sweet, thus there is a need to test if appetite or food cravings vary in 
accordance with different proportions of vegetable glycerine to propylene glycol. If there 
is an effect of vaping on weight, is this effect only present in those quitting smoking or 
can it also be seen in those who are naïve to nicotine? Such questions could be 
explored in human laboratory experiments involving both smokers about to quit and 
never smokers. 
 
Clearly, such research would not be without controversy. It could be considered 
unethical to introduce naive users to nicotine, a potentially dependency forming 
substance. Short-term nicotine vaping is unlikely to lead to nicotine dependency or 
tobacco smoking and should be sufficient to determine at what level an effect on 
appetite may be detected if at all. Vaping is not considered harmless even without 
nicotine (68), thus introducing current non-smokers to vaping even without nicotine could 
also be considered unethical. In addition, there is opposition to vaping among some 
public health researchers. Their alarm that smokers are switching to vaping, despite the 
estimated 95% lowered health risk (64) could increase at the thought of non-smokers 
being attracted to vaping for weight control if this concept begins to be discussed in the 
scientific or public realm. In the immediate term, therefore, the potential of vaping for 
weight control should be carefully explored in studies where e-cigs are used for smoking 
cessation.  The research community, policy makers and the public need to be aware of 
the emerging perception that vaping may have potential benefit for appetite and weight 
control.
