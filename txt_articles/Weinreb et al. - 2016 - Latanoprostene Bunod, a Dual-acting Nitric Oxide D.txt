urrent topical treatments for glaucoma have limited efficacy in lowering intraocular pressure (IOP) and/or can produce side effects and 
tolerability problems. At present, IOP remains the only known modifiable risk factor to delay the progression of glaucoma. The novel 
IOP-lowering treatment latanoprostene bunod (LBN) is a nitric oxide (NO)-donating prostaglandin F2α analog that is rapidly metabolized 
in situ to latanoprost acid and butanediol mononitrate, an NO-donating moiety. LBN has a dual action in that it enhances aqueous humor outflow 
via both the uveoscleral and trabecular meshwork pathways. It is undergoing regulatory review by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for 
the reduction of IOP in patients with open-angle glaucoma (OAG) or ocular hypertension (OHT). In the dose-ranging VOYAGER study, LBN 0.024%, 
the lower of the most effective concentrations evaluated, demonstrated significantly greater IOP lowering and comparable side effects compared 
with latanoprost 0.005%. The recent APOLLO phase III clinical study (n=420) found LBN 0.024% demonstrated significantly greater reductions in 
IOP than timolol 0.5% in patients with OAG or OHT at various time points over 3 months. The same study found the proportion of patients with IOP 
≤18 mmHg was significantly greater with LBN 0.024% than with timolol 0.5%. In the LUNAR study (n=420), LBN 0.024% was non-inferior to timolol 
0.5% over 3 months’ treatment. LBN treatment also resulted in significantly greater IOP lowering than timolol at all time-points with the exception 
of the first post-baseline assessment. In JUPITER, a study of 130 subjects with OAG or OHT, LBN 0.024% was safe and well tolerated when used 
for up to a year, and provided significant and sustained IOP reduction. Further, in CONSTELLATION, a study of 25 patients with OHT or OAG, IOP 
lowering with LBN 0.024% was consistently lower than baseline during both the diurnal/wake and nocturnal/sleep periods whereas timolol 
0.5% reduced IOP only during the diurnal period. In addition, LBN 0.024% treatment resulted in a significantly increased diurnal ocular perfusion 
pressure versus baseline and nocturnal ocular perfusion pressure versus timolol 0.05%. Similarly, in KRONUS, a single-arm, single-center, open-
label study of 24 healthy Japanese subjects, LBN 0.024% significantly lowered mean IOP over a 24-hour period. Across these studies, LBN has 
demonstrated a favorable safely profile and good ocular tolerability. It is hypothesized that LBN’s dual action on the outflow pathways accounts 
for the improved efficacy when compared with latanoprost and timolol.

Glaucoma is a multifaceted disorder resulting from damage to the retinal 
ganglion cells (RGCs) and their axons, causing progressive optic nerve 
degeneration and leading to irreversible blindness in some patients.1–4 In 
most cases the condition develops gradually, with peripheral vision loss 
typically being followed by loss of central vision.5 In the US, in 2011, open-
angle glaucoma (OAG) affected 2.71 million persons and is estimated to 
rise to 7.32 million by 2050.6 Globally, glaucoma affected an estimated 
64.3 million people (aged 40–80 years) in 2013.7 Given the aging of the 
world’s population, this number is expected to rise to 76.0 million in 2020 
and to 111.8 million in 2040.7
Ocular hypertension (OHT) can be defined as a high intraocular 
pressure (IOP) without observable optic nerve damage.4 OAG and angle-
closure glaucoma are the two predominant types of glaucoma, and are 
characterized by an elevated IOP
.9 Normal tension glaucoma (NTG) is a 
form of OAG that is prevalent in both Japanese and Western populations.10 
While damage to the optic nerve occurs without elevation of IOP in NTG, 
IOP reduction has been shown to reduce visual field damage in patients 
with NTG.10

Latanoprostene Bunod for Lowering of Intraocular Pressure 
Current treatment options target IOP reduction to delay progressive 
glaucomatous damage and to delay onset of visual field loss in subjects 
with OHT; these include topical medications, laser trabeculoplasty, and 
surgical drainage procedures (micro-invasive glaucoma surgery [MIGS], 
trabeculectomy, tube shunts).11–13 However, commonly used topical 
treatments (prostaglandin analogs [PGA], beta blockers, carbonic anhydrase 
inhibitors, and α2-adrenergic agonists) can be limited by ocular and 
systemic side effects, allergies, the need for multiple administrations every 
day, poor adherence/compliance, and an inability to consistently control 
24-hour IOP (Table 1). A new molecular entity incorporating both the 
established prostaglandin F2α (PGF2α) analog, latanoprost acid and a nitric 
 
oxide (NO)-donating group (latanoprostene bunod [LBN, BOL-303259-X] 
Bausch & Lomb Inc. Bridgewater, NJ, USA) is currently under review by 
the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US as a novel IOP-lowering 
monotherapy for glaucoma management. This review discusses the dual 
mechanism of action of this potential new treatment and evaluates the 
clinical evidence supporting the compound’s efficacy.
Pathophysiology of glaucoma
Increased IOP raises risk for glaucoma, which is characterized by RGC 
damage and death that results in changes to the optic nerve head and the 
visual field. IOP is affected by the balance between aqueous humor  (AH) 
secretion and its subsequent drainage through the trabecular meshwork 
(TM) and the uveoscleral outflow pathway.5,14–17 AH is secreted into the 
anterior chamber via the ciliary epithelium and returns to the vasculature 
through the TM into Schlemm’s canal, draining into collector channels, 
aqueous and episcleral veins; or it is drained via the uveoscleral route. 
Recent laboratory studies show cyclic IOP changes, possibly prompted 
by a reduction in pressure-dependent drainage, alter this aqueous 
outflow.18 At least 75% of the resistance to AH outflow in humans is 
localized within the TM, predominantly in the juxtacanalicular portion; 
 
in glaucoma, this tissue is altered leading to elevated IOP
.16 In addition 
to IOP
, other risk factors affecting the development and/or progression of 
glaucoma include older age, African ancestry or Hispanic ethnicity, larger 
optic nerve cup-to-disc ratios, thinner central corneas, family history of 
glaucoma, diabetes, myopia, history of migraine headaches, and lower 
ocular perfusion pressure.19,20
Current medical treatments for glaucoma 
Topical ocular hypertensive medications which lower IOP have been the 
mainstay for first-line treatment of OHT and OAG to even before large, 
population-based clinical studies identified IOP as a modifiable risk factor. 
The Ocular Hypertension Treatment Study evaluated 1,636 individuals 
with an IOP of 24–32 mmHg in one eye and 21–32 mmHg in the fellow 
eye who were randomized to observation or to topical ocular hypotensive 
medication.21 Early treatment of OHT to lower IOP decreased the cumulative 
incidence of OAG at a median follow up of 13 years (16% versus 22% 
overall; p=0.009). 
The Early Manifest Glaucoma Trial was a randomized clinical trial that included 
255 patients aged 50–80 years (median, 68 years) with early glaucoma, 
visual field defects (median mean deviation, -4 dB), and a median IOP of

Review  Glaucoma
20 mmHg.11 These signs were mainly identified through a population 
screening. The patients were randomized to no initial treatment or to 
treatment. The treated patients had laser trabeculoplasty and started 
receiving topical betaxolol twice daily in eligible eyes. Follow-up visits 
included tonometry and computerized perimetry every 3 months and 
fundus photography every 6 months. The results suggest that a reduction 
of 1 mmHg could be correlated with an approximate 10% decrease in 
risk for glaucoma progression over a 4–6 year period.11,12 There are five 
major classes of topical medications currently approved for the treatment 
of elevated IOP designed to either reduce the production of ocular fluid 
 
or facilitate its outflow (Table 1).22–24 Until the pathophysiology of glaucoma 
is better understood, there is little likelihood other therapeutic targets 
will become a more central component of glaucoma management. 
Each of these classes of drugs has its own advantages and drawbacks 
(Table 1). The α2-adrenergic receptor agonists, for instance, decrease the 
production of aqueous by the ciliary body and act on uveoscleral outflow, 
but can cause fatigue, high blood pressure or anxiety. While the β-blockers 
reduce AH secretion to lower IOP
, and although rarely cause ocular side 
effects, may cause respiratory and cardiac side effects.22,23 Also, unlike the 
cholinergics, β-blockers do not affect pupil size. As miotics, the cholinergic 
agents target the conventional outflow pathway indirectly, by inducing 
ciliary muscle contraction that expands the TM and dilates Schlemm’s 
canal, reducing outflow resistance; however, they are not used widely due 
to local side effects.25
 
The side-effect profile of the PGA class of drugs is substantially superior 
to that of the β-blockers, which meant that the class quickly became 
the first-line treatment of choice for many clinicians. This class of drugs 
is known to cause conjunctival hyperemia,26 but the effects are typically 
considered mild and transient. Other effects include permanent iris 
color change and periorbital pigmentation and eye lash growth.27 PGAs 
bind primarily to prostaglandin receptors in the TM, ciliary muscle, and 
sclera, leading to altered matrix metalloproteinases expression.17,28 
The mechanism of action of this class enhances uveoscleral outflow to 
lower IOP
. The first PGA to be approved was latanoprost, and since then 
other PGAs, including travoprost, tafluprost, bimatoprost, and unoprostone, 
have also received regulatory approval.29 
New and emerging glaucoma treatments 
Several new IOP-lowering treatments that target various other mechanisms 
of action are in late-phase development. Among them is netarsudil 
(Rhopressa™, AR-13324 [Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc, Irvine, CA, US]) 
ophthalmic solution, which is a small-molecule inhibitor of both Rho-kinase 
(ROCK) and the norepinephrine transporter (NET). Netarsudil is thought to 
target the trabecular network and thus the abnormal tissues responsible 
for elevated IOP in glaucoma. The safety and efficacy of netarsudil 
monotherapy are being compared with timolol maleate (0.5%) in patients 
with OAG or OHT in two phase III trials (NCT02246764 and NCT02207621, 
n=240 and 690, respectively). A phase II clinical trial (n=298) showed that 
in patients with OAG or OHT, a fixed combination of netarsudil 0.02% and 
latanoprost (0.005%) (Roclatan®, PG324 [Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc, Irvine, 
CA, US]) showed significantly improved reduction in IOP than either of the 
two treatments alone (p<0.0001).30 The most frequently reported adverse 
event was conjunctival hyperemia, which occurred with an incidence of 
41% (30/73), 40% (29/73) and 40% (31/78) in the PG324 0.01% and PG324 
0.02% and AR-13324 0.02% groups, respectively compared with only 14% 
(10/73) in the latanoprost group.
Another class of potential IOP-lowering agents is the adenosine agonists. 
These bind to adenosine A1 receptors which, in the eye, reduce outflow 
resistance consequently lowering IOP
.31 An example is trabodenoson (INO-
8875), which showed significantly greater reductions in IOP compared with 
placebo at 14 and 28 days (p=0.01 and p<0.001, respectively) in a phase II 
trial of patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) or OHT.32,33 The 
effect on IOP and safety parameters of trabodenoson at three different 
dose levels (4.5% twice daily [BID], 6.0% once daily [QD], 3.0% QD), timolol 
0.5% BID, and placebo is being compared in a phase III trial in patients 
(planned n=335) with POAG and/or OHT (NCT02565173). 
A3 adenosine receptor (A3AR) agonists have been found to protect normal 
cells from undergoing apoptosis via the downregulation of death signals 
and may be able to prevent RGC apoptosis.31 A phase II study on an oral 
A3AR medication, CF-101, is currently recruiting subjects with OHT and 
glaucoma (NCT 01033422). 
Another class of potential IOP-lowering agents is the selective prostaglandin 
EP2 receptor agonists.34 One member of this class, taprenepag isopropyl 
(PF-04217329)35,36 has been evaluated in a phase II clinical trial (n=250).37 
Taprenepag 0.0025–0.03% dosed daily produced significantly greater 
reductions in IOP than placebo (vehicle) and showed similar reductions 
in IOP compared with latanoprost 0.005% after 14 days in patients 
with OHT and OAG. In addition, the combination of taprenepag and 
latanoprost showed significantly greater reductions in IOP than latanoprost 
 
0.005% alone.
Latanoprostene bunod—a novel nitric oxide-
donating prostaglandin F2α analog
LBN ophthalmic solution 0.024% is an IOP lowering eye drop dosed 
once daily in the evening for patients with OAG or OHT and is currently 
under regulatory review by the FDA.38 LBN is a single entity NO-donating 
prostaglandin F2α analog. Following topical ocular administration, 
 
LBN is rapidly metabolized by esterases into latanoprost acid and 
butanediol mononitrate (BDMN), an NO-donating moiety (Figure 1).39 
BDMN is further metabolized to 1,4-butanediol and the signaling 
molecule, NO. These two active metabolites each have IOP-lowering 
properties. This factor and various experimental findings have led to 
the hypothesis that LBN functions via a dual mechanism of action: 
by increasing both non-conventional (uveoscleral) AH outflow via 
latanoprost acid and conventional (TM/Schlemm’s canal) AH outflow 
 
via NO donation (Figure 2).28,40
The mechanism of IOP reduction by one of the metabolites, latanoprost 
acid, the active moiety of latanoprost, has been studied extensively. 
Latanoprost acid lowers IOP by remodeling the extracellular matrix in 
the ciliary muscle, which increases the uveoscleral AH outflow.41–45,46 
Widespread clinical use of the topical PGA latanoprost, an isopropyl 
ester analog of PGF2α, is based on its ability to lower IOP to a greater 
extent than other topical agents with a once daily dosing regimen 
coupled with minimal side effects.28,47–51 The recent United Kingdom 
Glaucoma Treatment Study was the first randomized, placebo-
controlled trial conducted in patients with OAG (n=516) that assessed 
vision preservation via IOP-lowering in patients treated with latanoprost 
compared with placebo.52 At 24 months, the mean (standard deviation 
[SD]) IOP reduction from baseline was greater in the latanoprost group 
(3.8 [4.0] mmHg) compared with the placebo group (0.9 [3.8] mmHg). In

Latanoprostene Bunod for Lowering of Intraocular Pressure 
addition, time-to-first visual field deterioration was significantly longer 
in the latanoprost group versus placebo group (adjusted hazard risk [HR] 
0.44, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.28–0.69; p=0.0003). 
The other LBN active metabolite, NO, is a critical physiologic signaling 
molecule known for its role as a mediator of smooth muscle relaxation 
and vasodilation in the body.53–55 NO is produced endogenously from 
L-arginine by NO synthases and signals via the second messenger cyclic 
guanosine monophosphate (cGMP).40 In the healthy eye, NO is produced in 
anterior ocular tissues, including the TM.56,57 Ocular blood flow impairment 
is hypothesized to contribute to RGC damage58 and several studies have 
suggested a vasodilatory role of NO on ocular blood vessels,59–61 although 
no data are currently available to support the potential for RGC rescue or 
protective properties for LBN. Endogenous NO has been shown to regulate 
physiological IOP
.62 Decreased NO synthase activity in the TM, Schlemm’s 
canal and ciliary muscle; coupled with decreased NO metabolites levels 
in the AH of patients with OAG, suggest that reduced NO production likely 
contributes to the IOP increase.63–65 
Outside ophthalmology, nitrovasodilators are used in the treatment and 
prevention of angina pectoris. In the eye, NO-donating nitrovasodilators 
have been demonstrated to lower IOP primarily by increasing TM/Schlemm’s 
canal (conventional) outflow.66 An early clinical study demonstrated 
that systemic administration of nitroglycerin resulted in IOP lowering in 
patients with POAG.67 Since then, animal studies have confirmed these 
nitrovasodilators lower IOP and further demonstrated that this is through 
an increase in conventional AH outflow.62,68–71 Numerous in vitro and ex vivo 
studies also suggest that NO-donors relax the tissues of the conventional 
outflow pathway57,72–75 Ex vivo preparations of bovine and porcine origin also 
demonstrated the ability of NO donors to reduce AH formation.76,77 
Alterations in cell contractility/shape could be the basis of NO-donor 
mediated IOP-lowering. In vitro studies showed that NO donors 
decrease TM cell volume through cGMP signaling and activation of 
the large-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (BKCa) channel.57 In addition, 
 
NO-donors may induce alterations in the cytoskeletal (actin and myosin) 
organization of TM and Schlemm’s canal cells via an increase in 
cGMP.57,73,78,79 NO donors have an inhibitory effect on ROCK, downstream 
of cGMP in the NO soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC)/cGMP pathway.80,81 
ROCK is a serine-threonine kinase that regulates the shape and 
movement of cells by acting on the cytoskeleton.82 In vascular smooth 
muscle cells (VSMCs), ROCK mediates the phosphorylation of myosin 
light chains enabling the contraction of actin fibers.83 TM cells are highly 
contractile and in this respect, are similar to VSMCs in which NO/sGC/
cGMP signaling activates protein kinase G. Protein kinase G, in turn, 
promotes relaxation via multiple pathways, including inhibition of ROCK 
and activation of the large-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (BKCa) channel. 
Activation of the sGC/cGMP signaling pathway may therefore result 
in relaxation in TM cells and Schlemm’s canal, leading to increased 
aqueous outflow.
 
Preclinical studies have also demonstrated that LBN has a greater effect 
on TM cell relaxation than the prostaglandin latanoprost.84 Studies in 
 
FP-receptor knockout mice and rabbits, a species which does not respond 
to latanoprost, have demonstrated that while LBN reduces IOP in these 
models, there is a lack of effective IOP reduction in response to latanoprost 
treatment, highlighting the contribution of NO to the IOP lowering efficacy 
of LBN.39,85 LBN also produced greater IOP lowering than latanoprost in 
animal models of glaucoma or OHT.39 In ocularly hypertensive primates, 
LBN achieved a maximum decrease in IOP of 31% and 35% relative to 
baseline at doses of 0.036% (9 μg) and 0.12% (36 μg), respectively, 
whereas latanoprost elicited a greater response than vehicle only at 0.1% 
(30 μg), with a peak effect of 26%. Furthermore, in glaucomatous dogs, 
IOP decreased from baseline by 44% and 10% following LBN 0.036% and 
 
vehicle, respectively, while latanoprost (0.030%) lowered IOP by 27% 
 
and vehicle by 9%.39

Review  Glaucoma
Clinical studies investigating the use of 
latanoprostene bunod in glaucoma
Clinical studies have defined further the activity of LBN in patients with 
OAG and OHT (Table 2). The VOYAGER study was a phase II, parallel group, 
dose-ranging study that compared the efficacy and safety of four different 
concentrations of LBN with latanoprost (0.005%) in patients with OAG or 
OHT.38 Patients were eligible if they had an IOP of 22–32 mmHg, and an 
IOP of ≥24 mmHg for at least two of three measurements during Visit 
3 (Day 1, baseline), which occurred after a 28-day washout period in 
subjects previously treated with IOP-lowering medications. Patients were 
randomized to LBN 0.006% (n=82), LBN 0.012% (n=85), LBN 0.024% (n=83), 
LBN 0.040% (n=81), or latanoprost 0.005% (n=82) dosed once daily in the 
evening for 28 days. All doses resulted in significant reductions in mean 
diurnal IOP from baseline at all follow-up visits (p<0.0001). The response 
was dose-dependent and plateaued with the 0.024%–0.040% doses. 
LBN 0.024% was the most effective dose, achieving a greater diurnal 
IOP reduction compared with latanoprost 0.005% at Day 28 (p=0.005). 
The difference in reduction of diurnal IOP between LBN 0.024% and 
latanoprost 0.005% at Day 28 was 1.23 mmHg. On secondary efficacy 
assessments, there were significantly greater reductions in mean diurnal 
IOP versus latanoprost at day 7 for the LBN 0.024% and 0.040% groups 
(p=0.033 and 0.009, respectively), and at Day 14 for the LBN 0.024% 
group (p=0.015). Significantly greater reductions in mean IOP were also 
observed for LBN 0.024% compared with latanoprost 0.005% at most 
individual time points. In addition, a significantly greater proportion of 
subjects had mean diurnal IOP ≤18 mmHg in the LBN 0.024% group at day 
28 compared with the latanoprost 0.005% group (Figure 3). LBN was well 
tolerated but instillation site pain appeared to occur more frequently with 
LBN 0.024% (12%) versus latanoprost 0.005% (6.1%).
 
The clinical development program of LBN has continued with two recent 
phase III, randomized, double-masked, parallel-group clinical studies 
(APOLLO and LUNAR). The APOLLO study (n=420) was a randomized, 
controlled, multi-center, double-masked, parallel-group clinical study that 
compared the 3-month efficacy (IOP reduction) and safety of LBN 0.024% 
with that of timolol maleate 0.5% (randomized 2:1, respectively) in patients 
with OAG or OHT in one or both eyes (IOP range: 22–36 mmHg).86 Eligible 
patients had an IOP ≥26 mmHg at a minimum of 1 time point, ≥24 mmHg 
at a minimum of one time-point, and ≥22 mmHg at one time-point in 
the same eye, and IOP ≤36 mmHg at all three time-points in both eyes 
at baseline. Eligible patients received topical doses of LBN 0.024% QD 
(evening) or timolol 0.5% BID (morning and evening) for 3 months and IOP 
measurements were made at baseline (at 8 am, 12 pm and 4 pm), and at 
 
8 am, 12 pm and 4 pm during study visits at 2 weeks, 6 weeks and 3 months 
(nine time points) after the start of treatment. 
Mean IOP in the study eye in the intent-to-treat population, which was the 
primary endpoint, was significantly lower in the LBN 0.024% group (range, 
17.8–18.7 mmHg) than the timolol 0.5% group (range,19.1–19.8 mmHg) at all 
9 time points (p≤0.002 for all), confirming not only non-inferiority to timolol

Latanoprostene Bunod for Lowering of Intraocular Pressure 
but significantly greater IOP-lowering to timolol.86 The change in mean IOP 
from baseline was also significantly greater for LBN 0.024% compared with 
timolol 0.05% at all 9 time points (p≤0.002 for all) (Figure 4).
 
For secondary endpoints, at all nine time points, the proportion of subjects 
with mean IOP ≤18 mmHg was significantly greater with LBN 0.024% 
versus timolol 0.5% (mean IOP ≤18 mmHg: 22.9% versus 11.3%, p=0.005).86 
The percentage of subjects with IOP change from baseline ≥25% was 
also significantly greater for LBN 0.024% than timolol 0.05% (34.9% versus 
 
19.5%, p<0.001). A further ANCOVA analysis showed that the mean change 
from baseline in IOP for LBN 0.024% (range, –7.7 to –9.1 mmHg) was 
significantly greater than that of timolol 0.5% (range, –6.6 to –8.0) for all 
nine time points (p≤0.002).86
The occurrence and types of ocular adverse events in the APOLLO study 
were similar in both treatment groups (Table 3).86 Treatment-emergent 
adverse events (TEAEs) occurred in 13.4% of LBN 0.024% and 11.9% of 
timolol 0.5%-treated patients. The most frequent events were eye irritation, 
conjunctival hyperemia, and eye pain. Two patients in the LBN 0.024% 
group and five in the timolol 0.5% group discontinued due to ocular adverse 
events. Similar proportions of patients receiving LBN 0.024% or timolol 0.5% 
had non-ocular TEAEs (12.7% and 14.1%, respectively). The proportions of 
patients with these TEAEs that were considered treatment-related were 
1.8% and 2.2%, respectively. It was concluded that LBN 0.024% was safe 
and significantly more effective than timolol 0.5% for IOP lowering. In 
addition, the ability to reduce IOP ≤18 mmHg with LBN may be a significant 
advantage over topical β-blockers.
The findings of the similarly designed LUNAR study (n=420) indicate 
comparable IOP lowering to the APOLLO study between LBN 0.024% and 
timolol 0.5% over 3 months.87 At all but one of the measured time-points (i.e. 
12 pm, 4 pm, at week 2, 8 am, 12 pm and 4 pm at week 6 and month 3), the 
mean IOP in the study eye was significantly lower in the LBN 0.024% group 
than in the timolol 0.5% group. Results from APOLLO and LUNAR showed 
that LBN 0.024% reduced mean IOP values by 7.5 to 9.1 mmHg over the 
three months’ treatment. Following completion of the double-masked 
efficacy phase, all patients were switched to open-label treatment with 
LBN 0.024% once daily in the evening for another 9 (APOLLO) or 3 (LUNAR) 
months. From pooled data from the APOLLO and LUNAR open-label safety 
extension phase (number of patients completed the studies=737), subjects 
randomized to timolol who were switched to LBN in the safety extension 
phase demonstrated an additional 6.3–8.3% decrease in mean diurnal 
IOP; IOP lowering was sustained over the entire duration of the studies.88 
Overall, 18.7% of subjects who received LBN experienced ocular TEAEs 
(study eye); the most common of these were conjunctival hyperemia 
(5.9%), eye irritation (4.6%), eye pain (3.5%). The majority (>99.5%) of ocular 
TEAEs were mild-moderate in severity. There were no safety issues with 
regard to ocular signs, best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), and vital signs, 
or endothelial cell stress with LBN based on specular microscopy.

Review  Glaucoma
Treatment with LBN 0.024% once daily resulted in IOP lowering during both 
the diurnal/wake and the nocturnal/sleep period in the CONSTELLATION 
study.89 In this prospective, open-label randomized crossover trial in 25 
patients with OHT or OAG, LBN 0.024% treatment was associated with 
a reduction in both diurnal and nocturnal IOP versus baseline whereas 
timolol 0.5% reduced IOP only during the diurnal period.89 In addition, 
LBN 0.024% treatment resulted in a significant increased diurnal ocular 
perfusion pressure versus baseline and nocturnal ocular perfusion 
pressure versus timolol 0.05%.
In the single-arm, multicenter, open-label JUPITER study, the long-term 
safety and efficacy of LBN 0.024% was studied over 1 year in 130 Japanese 
subjects with OAG and OHT with a mean (SD) baseline IOP of 19.6 (2.9) 
mmHg.90 At 52 weeks, the mean reduction in IOP was 5.3 mmHg or greater 
than 25% from baseline in the study eye. Long-term treatment in this study 
provided significant IOP reduction that was sustained up to a year. Finally, 
LBN 0.024% dosed QD for 14 days, was showed to significantly lower mean 
IOP during a 24-hr period in 24 healthy Japanese subjects in the single-
center, open-label KRONUS study91 with a mean (SD) 24-hour reduction of 3.6 
(0.8) mmHg or 27% from the baseline in the study eye.91 Mean (SD) baseline 
IOP was 13.6 (1.3) mmHg in the study eye.91 Peak and trough IOP lowering 
occurred at 8 AM and 8 PM (i.e. 12 and 24 hours following instillation) 
with a mean reduction of 4.2 (1.8) mmHg, or 30%, and 2.8 (2.2) mmHg, 
 
or 20%, respectively.
Collectively, the VOYAGER, APOLLO, LUNAR, CONSTELLATION, JUPITER, 
and KRONUS study findings are likely to make a robust case for the use 
of topical LBN 0.024% in OAG and OHT. Further, data from the JUPITER 
and KRONUS studies suggest that LBN may by effective in lowering IOP in 
patients with NTG.
Summary and concluding remarks
While effective, many of the current topical medical treatments are limited 
by systemic or local side effects, multiple instillations per day, and lack 
of 24-hour control of IOP
. LBN is hypothesized to increase AH outflow 
by targeting both the uveoscleral (via latanoprost acid) and TM (via NO) 
pathways and is under regulatory review by the US FDA as a once-daily 
single-agent topical medication for IOP lowering in patients with OAG or 
OHT. Evidence from phase II and phase III clinical studies demonstrated that 
once-daily LBN lowers IOP in patients with OAG or OHT to a greater extent 
than latanoprost 0.005% and timolol 0.5%.38,87,86 The observed 1.23 mmHg 
difference in mean diurnal IOP change from baseline between LBN 0.024% 
and latanoprost 0.005% in the phase II trial was statistically significant and 
may be considered clinically significant in reducing the risk for progression 
of glaucoma. These findings are supported and greatly extended by the 
results of the larger phase III APOLLO study in which IOP was significantly 
lower with LBN 0.024% treatment than timolol 0.5% at all time points over 
 
3 months. Results from the second phase III (LUNAR) study are consistent with 
these findings. LBN appears to have a dual mechanism of action in lowering 
IOP and has demonstrated the potential to provide sustained 24-hour IOP 
reduction in healthy subjects and patients with elevated IOP
.89,91 Obtaining 
superior effects from fewer doses of medication could make a difference in 
both patient adherence and compliance. Long-term (1 year) data on LBN’s 
sustained IOP lowering efficacy has recently been published90 and further 
investigation is required to explore the additional beneficial properties and 
safety with long-term use of LBN and specifically in subjects with NTG.
The addition of LBN QD single-molecule monotherapy that targets both 
outflow pathways to the glaucoma treatment armamentarium offers the 
potential of increased IOP lowering efficacy without sacrificing safety 
when compared with currently available topical glaucoma therapies. ❑
