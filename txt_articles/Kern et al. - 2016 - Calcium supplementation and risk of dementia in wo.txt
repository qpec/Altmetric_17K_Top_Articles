Calcium supplementation and risk of
dementia in women with cerebrovascular
disease
ABSTRACT
Objective: To determine whether calcium supplementation is associated with the development of
dementia in women after a 5-year follow-up.
Methods: This was a longitudinal population-based study. The sample was derived from the Pro-
spective Population Study of Women and H70 Birth Cohort Study in Gothenburg, Sweden, and
included 700 dementia-free women aged 70–92 years. At baseline in 2000–2001, and at
follow-up in 2005–2006, the women underwent comprehensive neuropsychiatric and somatic
examinations. A CT scan was performed in 447 participants at baseline. Information on the use
and dosage of calcium supplements was collected. Dementia was diagnosed according to
DSM-III-R criteria.
Results: Women treated with calcium supplements (n 5 98) were at a higher risk of developing
dementia (odds ratio [OR] 2.10, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01–4.37, p 5 0.046) and the
subtype stroke-related dementia (vascular dementia and mixed dementia) (OR 4.40, 95% CI
1.54–12.61, p 5 0.006) than women not given supplementation (n 5 602). In stratified analyses,
calcium supplementation was associated with the development of dementia in groups with a his-
tory of stroke (OR 6.77, 95% CI 1.36–33.75, p 5 0.020) or presence of white matter lesions (OR
2.99, 95% CI 1.28–6.96, p 5 0.011), but not in groups without these conditions.
Conclusions: Calcium supplementation may increase the risk of developing dementia in elderly
women with cerebrovascular disease. Because our sample was relatively small and the study
was observational, these findings need to be confirmed. Neurology® 2016;87:1674–1680

Dementia1 and osteoporosis are leading causes of disability in the elderly. Because calcium
deficiency contributes to osteoporosis, daily dietary calcium intake of 1,000–1,200 mg is
recommended.2 Such a large calcium intake through diet alone can be difficult; therefore,
calcium supplements are widely used.2 However, recently, the safety of calcium supplements
has been questioned.3 Dietary calcium in the recommended range seems to be safe or might even
be protective against vascular events,4 while the literature on calcium supplementation is incon-
clusive.5 Some trials have reported an association between calcium supplementation and
increased risk for vascular events,6 while others have reported no association.7,8 A permanent
increase in calcium levels increases vascular risk.9 Vascular risk factors are related to vascular
dementia (VaD) and Alzheimer disease (AD).10,11 Thus, if calcium supplement intake increases
the risk for vascular events, it might increase the risk for dementia. Calcium supplementation
might have direct toxic effects on vulnerable neurons, because the increased calcium levels may
amplify ischemic cell death and worsen the outcome after cerebrovascular events.12 The relation

 between calcium supplement and dementia
may be especially strong in persons with vascu-
lopathies such as stroke or ischemic white mat-
ter lesions (WMLs). Therefore, we hypothesized
that calcium supplementation is associated with
an increased risk of dementia and this associa-
tion is accentuated in individuals already com-
promised by ischemic cerebrovascular disease,
such as those with a history of stroke or ischemic
WMLs. This hypothesis was tested using a pop-
ulation sample of elderly women initially free
from dementia with a 5-year follow-up.
METHODS Sample. The baseline sample was derived from
the 2000–2003 examinations of the Prospective Population
Study of Women and the H70 Study in Gothenburg, Sweden.13
Samples were obtained from the Swedish Population Registry,
based on birth date, and included persons living in private house-
holds and residential care.13
The baseline sample has been described previously.13,14 The
study included women born on certain dates in 1908, 1914,
1918, 1922, and 1930 and living in Sweden on September 1,
2000.14 Among the 1,200 women selected, 49 died before exam-
ination, 12 could not speak Swedish, and 21 had emigrated from
Sweden, leaving an effective sample of 1,018.13,14 Among these,
789 participated in a neuropsychiatric examination (response
rate, 77.5%).13,14 At baseline, 89 women had dementia and were
excluded, leaving an effective sample size of 700 women for this
study (4 born in 1908, 27 in 1914, 137 in 1918, 193 in 1922,
and 339 in 1930).14 Differences between participants and non-
participants have been described previously.13
A follow-up examination was performed in 2005–2006. Of the
700 women examined at baseline, 64 died before follow-up, and 531
participated in the follow-up examination (response rate, 83.5%; 275
women born in 1930 and 256 born in 1908, 1914, 1918, or 1922).
Examinations were conducted at a geriatric outpatient clinic
in Gothenburg. Home visits were offered to participants who
refused examinations at the hospital and to participants who
had moved to other areas within Sweden.
Assessments.

and
follow-up
examinations. These assessments were conducted by experienced
psychiatric research nurses.13 We used the same methodology as the
one employed in a previous study.13 The semi-structured examinations
included ratings of psychiatric symptoms and signs and mental
functioning tests, including assessments of memory, aphasia, apraxia,
executive functioning, personality changes, and the Mini-Mental State
Examination (MMSE), as described previously.1,13
Participants also underwent somatic examinations, including
medical history, blood pressure, and serum total and high-density
lipoprotein cholesterol level measurements.13 Presence of diabetes
mellitus and cigarette smoking status were ascertained.13 In addi-
tion, APOE genotyping was performed.13
Drug utilization was recorded according to the Anatomical
Therapeutic Chemical classification system.13 Information on reg-
ular drug use, including calcium supplements, was collected from
multidose drug-dispensing lists.13 Participants were asked to show
the interviewer the drugs they used.13 A participant was classified as
a user if drug use was documented by either source.13 Information
on duration of drug use or dosage regimen was unavailable, but the
average recommended daily dose of calcium supplements in
Sweden is 1,000 mg.
Education was categorized as mandatory (6 years in participants
born in 1908–1922, 7 years in participants born in 1930) or more
than mandatory.13
Close informant interviews. Interviews were performed by
psychiatric research nurses at both examinations.13 The interviews
were semi-structured and included questions about changes in
behavior and cognitive function (e.g., memory, intellectual ability,
language, and executive function), personality changes, psychiatric
symptoms, activities of daily living, and in case of dementia, onset
age, and disease course, as described previously.1,13
An experienced neurologist, blinded to all clinical data, evaluated
all brain CT scans, as described previously.15 The Gothenburg scale
was used to rate WMLs.15,16 WMLs were defined as diffusely dis-
tributed periventricular or subcortical areas of decreased attenuation
below that expected for normal white matter.15,16 Interobserver agree-
ment for WMLs between the rater and a neuroradiologist was fair
(k 5 0.30).15 Of the 700 women, 447 consented to undergo a CT
scan (63.9%) of the brain. The sample has been described in detail
previously.15
Dementia diagnoses. Dementia was diagnosed according to
the DSM-III-R criteria17 by geriatric psychiatrists at consensus
meetings using a symptom algorithm with data from the psy-
chiatric examination and the key informant interview.1,11 Each
symptom was considered when it attained a level that caused
significant difficulties in everyday life.1,11 A final diagnosis was
made from the combined information.1,11
AD was diagnosed according to the National Institute of
Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the
Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Disorders Association crite-
ria.18,19 The criteria for VaD were similar to the criteria proposed
by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke
and the Association Internationale pour la Recherce et l’Enseigne-
ment en Neurosciences.20 VaD was diagnosed when there was
a temporal relationship (within 1 year) between a history of acute
focal neurologic symptoms and signs (hemiparesis or motor apha-
sia) and the first symptoms of dementia.19,20 A diagnosis of mixed
dementia was made when both AD and cerebrovascular disease
contributed to dementia. VaD and mixed dementia were com-
bined as stroke-related dementia.19,20
Dementias due to other causes (e.g., alcoholic dementia,
normal-pressure hydrocephalus, and vitamin B12 deficiency) were
diagnosed as described previously.1,21
For those lost to follow-up in 2005 (deceased and refusals),
dementia diagnoses were made from the data in the Swedish Hos-
pital Discharge Registry (using ICD diagnoses from 1980
onwards). In the whole dementia sample, 9 participants were
diagnosed based on only the registry data (2 participants with cal-
cium supplementation, 7 without calcium supplementation). In
Sweden, almost all inhabitants are included in public health serv-
ices and have equal chances of being in the hospital discharge
register.
Assessment of cardiovascular risk. As described previously,
a 10-year cardiovascular risk score based on the primary care
formula from the Framingham Heart Study was calculated.13
Assessment of osteoporosis-associated fractures. To assess
the confounding effect of indication for treatment, we assessed frac-
tures related to osteoporosis (hip, wrist, vertebrae compression, and
upper arm fractures).22,23 Information on fractures was obtained
from self-report and the Hospital Discharge Registry.
Statistical methods. Fisher exact test was used to test differen-
ces in proportions. A 2-tailed level of significance was employed (p ,
0.05). Differences in age and cardiovascular risk scores at baseline
were examined using the Mann-Whitney U test. Multivariate logistic
regressions were used to investigate the relationship between calcium

 use at baseline and development of dementia during the 5-year
follow-up. The overall effect of calcium supplements on dementia,
in general, was examined first. Thereafter, we divided dementia into
the following subtypes: AD, mixed dementia, and VaD.
In addition, we examined the relationship between calcium
supplementation and development of dementia, and stratified
the sample by history of stroke and presence of WMLs at baseline.
In the regression models, we controlled for baseline age, educa-
tion, total vascular risk, and presence of APOE e4. Using separate
regression models, we controlled for possible confounders, such as
estrogens, cortisone, and vitamin D. SPSS for Windows (v. 17,
SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) was implemented in all statistical tests.
Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient
consents. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee for
Medical Research at the University of Gothenburg. All participants
provided informed consent before participating in the study.13
RESULTS Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics
in 2000 for participants treated (n 5 98) and those
not treated (n 5 602) with calcium supplementation.
There were no differences between the groups in
the baseline characteristics of age, MMSE scores, and
education. History of stroke at baseline (n 5 54) or
follow-up (n 5 54) was noted in 108 individuals. Five
participants had a stroke after dementia was
diagnosed. There was no association between
calcium supplementation and stroke at baseline
(p 5 0.68) or new stroke during follow-up (p 5
0.54). Of those who received calcium supplements at
baseline (n 5 98), 77 (77.6%) received follow-up in
2005. At follow-up, 50 women (64.9%) were still using
calcium supplementation. Among the 447 participants
for whom CT scan was performed, 316 (70.7%) had
WMLs. There was no association between calcium
supplementation and WMLs at baseline (p 5 0.779).
Relationship between calcium supplementation and type
of dementia. Fifty-nine women developed dementia
between 2000 and 2005. Table 2 shows the different
types of dementia among women who took calcium
supplements at baseline and those who did not.
Table 3 shows the association between calcium sup-
plementation and dementia at follow-up. Women trea-
ted with calcium supplements had a higher risk of
developing dementia (odds ratio [OR] 2.10, 95% con-
fidence interval [CI] 1.01–4.37, p 5 0.046) and the
subtype dementia with stroke (VaD or mixed AD/
VaD) (OR 4.4, 95% CI 1.54–12.61, p 5 0.006) than
the women who did not take calcium supplementation.
Development of dementia in women with and without
a history of stroke. We stratified the sample into
women with (n 5 108) and without (n 5 592) a history
of stroke (table 4). In the group with history of stroke,
calcium supplementation was associated with develop-
ment of dementia (OR 6.77, 95% CI 1.36–33.75, p 5
0.020), but there was no relationship between calcium
supplementation and development of dementia in the
group without a history of stroke (OR 1.49, 95% CI
0.61–3.63, p 5 0.381; table 4).
Development of dementia in those with and those
without WMLs. We stratified the CT sample into
women with (n 5 316) and without (n 5 131) WMLs
(table 5). In the group with WMLs, calcium supplemen-
tation was associated with development of dementia
(OR 2.99, 95% CI 1.28–6.96, p 5 0.011), whereas
in the group without WMLs, none of the women
who used calcium supplements developed dementia
(p 5 0.351).

 Osteoporosis-associated fractures and treatment with
cortisone, estrogen, and calcium supplementation with
or without vitamin D. The frequency of fractures was
40.8% (n 5 40) in the group that received calcium
supplements and 20.8% (n 5 125) in the group that
did not (p , 0.001). The main results remained
unchanged in women with history of stroke and pres-
ence of WMLs when osteoporotic fractures and treat-
ment with cortisone, estrogens, and vitamin D (only 14
of 98 individuals took calcium supplements without
vitamin D) were included in the regression models (data
not shown).
DISCUSSION We found a relationship between cal-
cium supplementation and increased risk for demen-
tia in elderly women in this 5-year follow-up study.
This association was mainly confined to individuals
with cerebrovascular disease (history of stroke or
presence of WMLs) at baseline.
Stroke and WMLs increase the risk for demen-
tia.24,25 Herein, we add to this finding by showing that
calcium supplementation further increases this risk.
There may be several explanations for our results. Both
WMLs and stroke are markers of generalized cerebro-
vascular disease with different types of vessel pathology,
share common risk factors, and often co-occur. Histo-
pathologically, WMLs are related to diffuse ischemic
incomplete infarcts, presumably caused by hypoperfu-
sion and ischemia,26 and stroke is related to ischemic
infarcts, often surrounded by a penumbra of incom-
plete infarction. The mechanism of calcium supple-
ments in the pathogenesis of dementia could be the
steep increase in serum calcium levels caused by the
supplements.27 Neurons located in areas of hypoperfu-
sion might be especially vulnerable to the excitatory
and excitotoxic effects of the calcium-level peaks
caused by the supplementation. Calcium plays a central
role in the mechanisms of cell death. In necrosis, the
transmembrane influx of calcium ions activates pro-
teases that are responsible for degrading critical pro-
teins and disrupting membrane function.28 Studies in
in vitro models have shown that some surviving neu-
rons undergo apoptosis several hours after the mem-
brane potential is restored. Blocking calcium influx via
NMDA receptors prevents both necrosis and apopto-
sis. This indicates the crucial role of calcium influx and
intracellular calcium overload in the genesis of apopto-
sis and necrosis.29
It has been hypothesized that calcium supplements
affect the vessels, and thus, may potentiate changes in
the vessel walls in individuals with vascular disease,
thereby leading to ischemia and hypoperfusion. Athero-
sclerosis is a long-term process with different stages, and
calcium deposits become more common in the
advanced stages. The large- and medium-sized vessels
of individuals with stroke become compromised, which
may make them more vulnerable to the effect of cal-
cium supplementation. WMLs are related to small ves-
sel disease, i.e., arteriolosclerosis, hyalinosis, and lumen
narrowing of the small penetrating arteries and arterioles
in the white matter.30 The steep increase in serum cal-
cium levels after calcium supplementation might lead to
increased coagulability, lipohyalinosis, or altered vascu-
lar flow and might be mediated through calcium recep-
tors or changes in calcium-dependent hormone levels.27
Another explanation may be that calcium supplemen-
tation stimulates vascular calcification by abnormal
extraosseous deposition in atherosclerotic plaques.31
Dietary calcium might be protective against vascular
disease.4,32 The difference between dietary calcium and
calcium intake by supplements could be explained by
variations in corresponding changes in serum calcium
concentration. Dietary intake does not increase the
serum calcium levels to the same extent as supplements.27

 In addition, dietary calcium intake involves simultaneous
intake of all other components of calcium-containing
foods and much lower dosages of calcium than calcium
supplements.
The relationship between calcium supplements and
risk of dementia and cardiovascular events was examined
in the Women’s Health Initiative Calcium/Vitamin D
supplementation study (WHI CaD).6,8,33 In this large
7-year randomized controlled trial, the assignment of
participants to calcium and vitamin D supplement
groups was not related to the development of incident
cognitive impairment or dementia,33 myocardial infarc-
tion, or stroke.8 However, in WHI CaD, about half of
the women were taking personal (non-study-protocol)
calcium, vitamin D, or both. A comprehensive reanal-
ysis,6 only including women who did not take personal
calcium and vitamin D supplements, showed that cal-
cium supplementation increased the risk of myocardial
infarction or stroke.6 There was no such reanalysis for
dementia or cognitive decline. In our study, calcium
supplementation was not related to stroke during the
follow-up or to WMLs at baseline, although cerebrovas-
cular disease and dementia are closely related. As dis-
cussed previously, calcium supplements may only be
hazardous to already compromised neurons. A previous
study demonstrated that use of calcium-containing die-
tary supplements was associated with greater brain lesion
volume on MRI.34
In WHI CaD, the authors stated that the effect of
vitamin D alone on cognition is difficult to determine.33
In this study, we did not detect a modifying effect of
vitamin D. Even if cross-sectional and prospective stud-
ies linked vitamin D deficiency to AD, VaD, and
cognitive decline,35 existing data are insufficient to con-
clude that vitamin D supplementation reduces the risk
for any chronic diseases than osteoporosis.36
The strengths of this study include the population-
based sample, the detailed examinations, the prospec-
tive design, and the large response rate at follow-up.
However, the study has a few limitations. First, we
had no information on dietary calcium, serum calcium,
or calcium use (causal or persistent). However, about
two-thirds of those followed up after 5 years were still
on the supplements. An even higher proportion prob-
ably comprises persistent users. Inclusion of causal
users may underestimate the effect of calcium supple-
ments on the risk of dementia.
Second, it must be emphasized that this is an obser-
vational study. Therefore, we cannot infer causality
from our analyses or exclude the possibility of con-
founding by indication, because persons using calcium
supplements may be less healthy than other individu-
als. However, we found no differences between the
groups for most health factors, except that women
on supplementations were more likely to have had
a fracture. Our results remained unchanged even when
controlling for osteoporosis-associated fractures. In
addition, from a fracture perspective, it may be

 problematic if these women did not take calcium
supplementation.
Third, information from participants who have
a fracture and can self-report information may differ
from those whose information is only obtained from
the registry.37
Fourth, the overall sample size, particularly of
dementia cases, was small (only 14 of 98 who used
calcium supplementation had dementia) and might
have led to a low statistical power in some of the sub-
groups; for example, the number of individuals with
pure VaD was too small for separate analyses, which
required us to merge this group with that of mixed
dementia. However, both these entities had a history
of stroke and are expected to share the same vulnera-
bility to calcium supplements.
Fifth, CT scans were not performed at follow-up.
Thus, we were unable to assess the effect of calcium
supplements on changes in WMLs or silent strokes.
Sixth, CT is less sensitive than MRI for detecting
WMLs and is more influenced by bone-hardening arti-
facts.38 However, CT is better for delineating clinically
relevant WMLs39 and is the most widely used imaging
technique worldwide. In addition, there is scarce evi-
dence to propose that MRI is better than CT in iden-
tifying cerebrovascular changes related to dementia.40
Moreover, as CT is less sensitive to motion artefacts
and requires a shorter examination time, it may be more
appropriate for older adults. Although the visual rating
of WMLs on CT is a rather coarse method, we have
previously identified associations between WMLs and
both dementia and depression.38 In fact, the absence of
perfect agreement probably attenuates the observed
relationships.
Seventh, the same individual rated all scans, which
may enhance the possibility for systematic error.
Finally, our study was conducted in women;
therefore, we cannot generalize these results to men.
