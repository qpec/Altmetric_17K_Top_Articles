reeclampsia affects 3% to 8% of pregnancies and is a 
leading cause of mortality during pregnancy. It is globally 
responsible for 60 000 deaths annually and far greater rates 
of fetal losses.1 Placental factors are released in excess into 
the maternal circulation, causing hypertension and endothe-
lial dysfunction. This leads to multisystem organ injury to the 
maternal kidneys, liver, hematological system, and the brain 
(causing eclamptic seizures).1
The only treatment for preeclampsia is delivery of the 
placenta as this removes the source of placental-derived 
factors responsible for the maternal organ injury.1,2 In pre-
term preeclampsia, clinicians are often forced to deliver 
the fetus preterm to save the mother. However, this inflicts 
iatrogenic prematurity, which can lead to cerebral palsy, 
chronic disability, or death. A treatment that quenches the 
severity of the maternal disease could allow these pregnan-
cies to safely advance to a gestation where neonatal out-
comes are significantly improved. Severe preeclampsia at 
any gestation can progress rapidly over hours and become 
life-threatening. Therefore, a treatment that reduces the 
Abstract—Preeclampsia is a severe complication of pregnancy. Antiangiogenic factors soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 
(sFlt-1) and soluble endoglin are secreted in excess from the placenta, causing hypertension, endothelial dysfunction, 
and multiorgan injury. Oxidative stress and vascular inflammation exacerbate the endothelial injury. A drug that can 
block these pathophysiological steps would be an attractive treatment option. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are safe in 
pregnancy where they are prescribed for gastric reflux. We performed functional studies on primary human tissues and 
animal models to examine the effects of PPIs on sFlt-1 and soluble endoglin secretion, vessel dilatation, blood pressure, 
and endothelial dysfunction. PPIs decreased sFlt-1 and soluble endoglin secretion from trophoblast, placental explants 
from preeclamptic pregnancies, and endothelial cells. They also mitigated tumor necrosis factor-α–induced endothelial 
dysfunction: PPIs blocked endothelial vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 expression, leukocyte adhesion to endothelium, 
and disruption of endothelial tube formation. PPIs decreased endothelin-1 secretion and enhanced endothelial cell 
migration. Interestingly, the PPI esomeprazole vasodilated maternal blood vessels from normal pregnancies and cases 
of preterm preeclampsia, but its vasodilatory effects were lost when the vessels were denuded of their endothelium. 
Esomeprazole decreased blood pressure in a transgenic mouse model where human sFlt-1 was overexpressed in placenta. 
PPIs upregulated endogenous antioxidant defenses and decreased cytokine secretion from placental tissue and endothelial 
cells. We have found that PPIs decrease sFlt-1 and soluble endoglin secretion and endothelial dysfunction, dilate blood 
vessels, decrease blood pressure, and have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. They have therapeutic potential 
for preeclampsia and other diseases where endothelial dysfunction is involved.  (Hypertension. 2017;69:457-468.

severity of preeclampsia at any gestation could improve clini-
cal outcomes.
Factors released in excess from the placenta in preeclamp-
sia thought to play an important role in causing endothelial 
dysfunction (and subsequent maternal organ injury) are the 
antiangiogenic factors soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 
(sFlt-1)3,4 and soluble endoglin (sENG).1,4–6 sFlt-1 is a splice 
variant of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 and 
comprises only the extracellular domain.3,4 sFlt-1 binds and 
sequesters circulating vascular endothelial growth factor, 
decreasing vascular endothelial growth factor signaling and 
its ability to promote vascular homeostasis.5 Furthermore, 
recent evidence suggests that sFlt-1 may induce hyperten-
sion by impairing endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) 
phosphorylation and increasing angiotensin II sensitivity.7 
sENG shares sequence homology with the extracellular 
domain of full-length membrane-bound endoglin, a corecep-
tor that facilitates transforming growth factor receptor-β1 and 
transforming growth factor receptor-β3 signaling in endothe-
lial cells. Like sFlt-1, sENG also antagonizes endothelial 
receptor signaling by competing with full-length endoglin, 
decreasing its ability to bind with its coreceptors to maintain 
vessel homeostasis.
The evidence linking sFlt-1 and sENG with the patho-
physiology of preeclampsia is strong.3–5 Circulating levels 
are significantly elevated in women with preeclampsia and 
levels correlate with disease severity.8 Administering sFlt-1 
to rats causes hypertension and proteinuria, hallmarks of 
preeclampsia.3 Adenoviral coadministration of both sFlt-1 
and sENG to rats recapitulate the full spectrum of multior-
gan injury seen in preeclampsia, including severe protein-
uria, thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes, and fetal 
growth restriction.9 Preeclampsia is also associated with 
placental and systemic oxidative stress2,10 and intravascular 
inflammation,2 which are thought to exacerbate the endo-
thelial injury.
Therefore, an attractive candidate therapeutic for pre-
eclampsia may be a drug that is considered safe in preg-
nancy and can do the following: (1) decrease sFlt-1 and 
sENG secretion, (2) decrease blood pressure, (3) decrease 
endothelial dysfunction, (4) upregulate endogenous antioxi-
dant defenses, and (5) decrease secretion of inflammatory 
cytokines. As far as we are aware, no such drug has been 
reported.
Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are widely prescribed 
during pregnancy for symptomatic gastric reflux. Large 
epidemiological studies have shown that they are safe 
in pregnancy, even when administered during the first 
trimester.11,12
It was reported that heme-oxygenase-1 (HO-1) may nega-
tively regulate sFlt-1 secretion.13 Noting that it has also been 
reported that the PPI lansoprazole upregulates HO-1 in gas-
tric mucosa,14 we hypothesized that PPIs might upregulate 
HO-1, which should then decrease sFlt-1 and sENG secretion. 
In this study, we report functional experiments on primary 
human tissues and mouse models that show PPIs have diverse 
actions that may mitigate the pathophysiology underlying pre-
eclampsia. Our data identify PPIs as candidate therapeutics 
for preeclampsia.
Methods
Detailed Methods are available in Methods in the online-only Data 
Supplement.
Methods Overview
We performed functional experiments where we administered proton 
pump inhibitors to primary human tissues or cells and assessed their 
effects on sFlt-1 and sENG secretion, endothelial dysfunction (using 
in vitro assays), whole vessel dilatation, and secretion of cytokines. 
To perform these experiments, we examined primary tissues from 
placenta (isolated cytotrophoblast cells or placental explant tissue 
from women diagnosed with preeclampsia), endothelial cells (human 
umbilical vein endothelial cells [HUVECs] and uterine microvascular 
cells), and whole vessels isolated from the omentum (maternal fatty 
apron tissue). All experiments were run with technical triplicates, and 
each experiment was repeated a minimum of 3× (using samples from 
different patients). We also performed in vivo experiments where we 
administered esomeprazole to a mouse model of preeclampsia (where 
sFlt-1 is overexpressed specifically in the placenta) and pregnant 
eNOS−/− mice.
We obtained ethical approval to perform these studies. All women 
provided written informed consent.
Statistical Analysis
All in vitro experiments were performed with technical triplicates, 
and all experiments were repeated a minimum of 3×. Data were 
tested for normal distribution and statistically tested as appropriate. 
When ≥3 groups were compared a 1-way ANOVA (for parametric 
data) or Kruskal–Wallis test (for nonparametric data) followed by 
multiple comparison with Dunnet or Bonferroni ad hoc test where 
appropriate or post hoc analysis using either the Tukey (parametric) 
or Dunn test (nonparametric). When 2 groups were analyzed, either 
an unpaired t test (parametric) or a Mann–Whitney U test (nonpara-
metric) was used. Data are expressed as mean fold change from con-
trol ± SEM.
Results
Proton Pump Inhibitors Decrease sFlt-1 Expression 
and Secretion From Placenta and Endothelium
In preeclampsia, excess secretion of sFlt-1 is thought to 
cause hypertension, endothelial dysfunction, and subse-
quent maternal organ injury. Administering PPIs (lansopra-
zole, rabeprazole, and esomeprazole) to primary trophoblast 
cells dose dependently reduced sFlt-1 secretion (Figure 1A, 
this ELISA detects all sFlt-1 variants) and reduced mRNA 
expression of the 2 major sFlt-1 variants present in pla-
centa: sFlt-1 e15a and sFlt-1 i13 (Figure S1A and S1B in 
the online-only Data Supplement). They also reduced sFlt-1 
secretion from placental explants obtained from normal 
(Figure S1C) and preeclamptic pregnancies (Figure 1B; 
see Table S1 for clinical information). PPIs also decreased 
sFlt-1 e15a protein secretion from preeclamptic placental 
explants (Figure 1C). sFlt-1 e15a (or sFlt-1 v14) is the main 
sFlt-1 variant in placenta15 that has only been described 
recently.15,16
Endothelium is another major tissue source of sFlt-
1. When administered to HUVECs, PPIs dose depend-
ently reduced sFlt-1 secretion (Figure 1D) but not  mRNA 
expression (Figure S1D and S1E) of the 2 sFlt-1 variants, 
sFlt-1 e15a and sFlt-1 i13. When we compared 5 PPIs, we 
found esomeprazole and rabeprazole were the most potent 
in reducing sFlt-1 secretion from HUVECs (Figure 1E). 
PPIs also decreased sFlt-1 secretion from primary uterine

microvascular cells that, unlike HUVECs, are a mix of venous 
and arterial endothelium (Figure S1F). Placental hypoxia 
increases sFlt-1 secretion, and there is evidence that its 
release may be regulated by hypoxia inducible factor-1α.17,18 
PPIs markedly decreased hypoxia inducible factor-1α pro-
tein expression (Figure 1F), raising the possibility that their 
ability to decrease sFlt-1 secretion may be mediated through 
hypoxia inducible factor-1α.

1 secretion. F, Western blot and densitometric analysis of HIF-1α expression in HUVECs treated with PPIs at 100 μmol/L for 24 h.

Proton Pump Inhibitors Decrease sENG Expression 
and Secretion From Placenta and Endothelium
sENG is the second major antiangiogenic factor released in 
excess from the placenta in preeclampsia and may play a role 
in severe disease.5,8,9 PPIs reduced sENG secretion from pri-
mary trophoblast (Figure 2A), HUVECs (Figure 2B), uterine 
microvascular cells (Figure S2A), and placental explants from 
cases of preterm preeclampsia (Figure 2C). When we com-
pared the ability of 5 PPIs to reduce sENG secretion from 
HUVECs, we identified rabeprazole and esomeprazole were 
the most potent (Figure 2D).
Interestingly, PPIs also induced proangiogenic vegfa 
mRNA expression in primary trophoblast (Figure 2E) and 
HUVECs (Figure S2B), but did not upregulate its family 
member, placental growth factor (not shown).
At the same doses used in our PPI experiments (up to 100 
μmol/L), pravastatin (proposed as a treatment for preeclamp-
sia19,20) did not significantly affect sFlt-1 or sENG secretion

from HUVECs (Figure S2C and S2D). We conclude that PPIs 
reduce secretion of sFlt-1 and sENG from primary placental 
and endothelial cells and increase both placental and endothe-
lial vegfa mRNA expression.
Decrease in sFlt-1 and sENG Secretion Observed 
With Proton Pump Inhibitors Is Not Explained by 
Inhibition of V-ATPase
We next set out to examine possible molecular pathways to 
explain how PPIs may be inhibiting sFlt-1 and sENG secre-
tion. As a medication for gastric reflux, PPIs were specifi-
cally designed to inhibit H+/K+ ATPase V-ATPase (a proton 
pump in the gastric epithelium) to decrease gastric acidity. Of 
note, the V-ATPase enzyme is also present in placenta.21–23 To 
examine whether the reduction in sFlt-1 and sENG secretion 
observed with PPI treatment is mediated through V-ATPase 
inhibition, we examined the effects of blocking V-ATPase 
by administering bafilomycin, a potent V-ATPase inhibitor.24 
Indeed, bafilomycin dose dependently decreased sFlt-1 secre-
tion by human trophoblast (Figure S3A). However, bafilomy-
cin did not decrease intracellular levels of sFlt-1 protein or 
the mRNA expression of the sFlt-1 variants (sFlt-1 i13 and 
sFlt-1 e15a; Figure S3B through S3D). In contrast, we con-
firmed esomeprazole (added as a positive control in the same 
experiment) significantly decreased sFlt-1 and mRNA expres-
sion of the 2 sFlt-1 variants. Furthermore, bafilomycin did not 
decrease sFlt-1 secretion from HUVECs, and in fact signifi-
cantly increased sENG secretion from HUVECs (Figure S3E 
and S3F). Given blocking V-ATPase with bafilomycin did not 
decrease intracellular sFlt-1 protein or mRNA expression or 
consistently reduce sFlt-1 and sEng secretion, it is unlikely 
that PPIs decrease the production of these antiangiogenic fac-
tors through V-ATPase.
Reduced sFlt-1 and sENG Secretion With Proton 
Pump Inhibitors Is Not Explained by Altered 
Expression of Cargo Export Proteins
ARF1 (ADP-ribosylation factor 1) and RAB11 (Ras-related 
Protein 11) are proteins involved in the secretion and trans-
port of proteins from cells. Given Jung et al25 previously con-
cluded that these proteins facilitate sFlt-1 secretion from cells, 
we examined whether PPIs may decrease sFlt-1 secretion by 
inhibiting the expression of these proteins. Treating tropho-
blast with esomeprazole in fact increased ARF1 expression 
(Figure S4A and S4B) and did not affect RAB11 expression 
(Figure S4C and S4D). Thus, it seems unlikely that these mol-
ecules are involved in the decrease in sFlt-1 secretion induced 
by PPIs.
Proton Pump Inhibitors Vasodilate Whole Human 
Vessels Ex Vivo and Decrease Blood Pressure in an 
Animal Model of Preeclampsia
Vasoconstriction and hypertension are hallmarks of pre-
eclampsia. We next examined whether PPIs have vasoactive 
properties. We isolated maternal omental arteries obtained 
at caesarean section from normal and preeclamptic women 
and performed pressure myography ex vivo. We first induced 
vasoconstriction by incubating arteries in U46619 (thrombox-
ane agonist [thromboxane is elevated in preeclampsia]26) and 
then added cumulative doses of esomeprazole. Esomeprazole 
caused potent dilation of arteries from both preeclamptic 
and normal pregnancies (Figure 3A and 3B; see Table S2 
for clinical characteristics of the preeclampsia cohort). The 
vasodilatory effects of esomeprazole seemed to be medi-
ated through the endothelium because vessels denuded of 
the endothelium did not dilate in response to esomeprazole 
(Figure 3C). To obtain in vivo evidence that PPIs are vaso-
active, we added esomeprazole to a transgenic preeclampsia 
mouse model where human sFlt-1 is overexpressed specifi-
cally in the placenta.27 As expected, a significant increase in 
blood pressure (both systolic and diastolic) was observed in 
untreated mice from E16.5.27 However, daily administration 
of 150 μg of esomeprazole (which approximately equates to a 
30-mg dose in humans) from E8.5 completely abrogated this 
increase in blood pressure (Figure 3D). There was a nonsig-
nificant trend toward decreased maternal proteinuria in mice 
treated with esomeprazole compared with controls, and there 
were no differences in measurements of various fetal or pla-
cental parameters (Figure S5A through S5E). There was also 
a nonsignificant trend toward a decrease in the blood pres-
sure of nonpregnant female mice administered esomeprazole 
when compared with mice receiving vehicle (Figure S5F). We 
confirmed the presence of human sFlt-1 in the mouse serum 
obtained at the time of sacrifice (Figure S5G). The fact that 
was no difference in sFlt-1 levels in this animal model given 
sFlt-1 is expected given it is autonomously expressed by the 
lentiviral plasmid.
Proton Pump Inhibitors May Be Promoting 
Vasodilation by Modulating eNOS and Endothelin-1 
Expression
eNOS is an enzyme in the endothelium that produces NO, 
a potent vasodilator that signals to the underlying vascular 
smooth muscle. Furthermore, it has recently been shown that 
sFlt-1 may be directly inducing hypertension in preeclampsia 
by impairing eNOS phosphorylation.7 We examined whether 
PPIs may be inducing vasorelaxation via the eNOS pathway. 
When we treated HUVECs with esomeprazole (Figure 4A), 
there was a significant increase in phosphorylated eNOS 
(p-eNOS, the active form). Cotreatment of tumor necrosis 
factor-α (TNF-α; a proinflammatory cytokine that circulates 
in excess in preeclampsia28 and likely contributor to endothe-
lial dysfunction29) with esomeprazole and rabeprazole at dif-
ferent doses all induced a nonsignificant increase in p-eNOS 
protein (Figure S6A and S6B). These data suggest the PPIs 
upregulate p-eNOS expression. To obtain further evidence 
for this, we next administered esomeprazole to pregnant mice 
lacking eNOS (eNOS−/−). These mice are chronically hyper-
tensive, which persists while they are pregnant.30 In contrast 
to the striking decrease in blood pressure seen in wild-type 
mice where sFlt-1 was overexpressed in placenta (Figure 3D), 
there was only a modest and nonsignificant decrease in blood 
pressure with esomeprazole treatment when the eNOS gene is 
absent (Figure 4B). Our data suggest that esomeprazole has 
vasodilatory properties and can decrease blood pressure in 
vivo (animal model) and ex vivo (whole maternal vessels from 
women with preeclampsia). Furthermore, this may be medi-
ated through the endothelium, where p-eNOS may play a role.

Endothelin-1 is potent vasoconstrictor released from the 
endothelium into the circulation and is increased in preeclamp-
sia.31 Administering PPIs to HUVECs reduced endothelin-1 
mRNA expression (Figure 4C) and protein secretion (Figure 4D). 
PPIs also decreased endothelin-1 mRNA expression in uterine 
microvascular endothelial cells (Figure S6C).

Proton Pump Inhibitors Rescue Endothelial 
Dysfunction In Vitro
Given the importance of endothelial dysfunction in preeclamp-
sia,2,5 another therapeutic strategy may be to identify drugs that 
act at the level of the endothelium to reduce dysfunction. PPIs 
potently blocked TNF-α–induced upregulation of vascular cell 
adhesion molecule-1 in HUVECs (Figure 5A; Figure S7A) 
and primary uterine microvascular cells (Figure S7B). PPIs 
also decreased vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 expression in 
HUVECs when preeclamptic serum was used instead of TNF-
α to induce endothelial dysfunction (Figure S7C).
Given vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 promotes 
leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium, we performed a 
monocyte adhesion assay. PPIs dose dependently decreased 
TNF-α–induced leukocyte adhesion to HUVECs (Figure 5B). 
We next performed endothelial tube-forming experiments and 
found that esomeprazole rescued TNF-α–induced tube disrup-
tion (Figure 5C). In addition, we examined endothelial cell 
migration using the xCELLigence assay, which allows cell 
migration to be continuously monitored in real time. Treating 
HUVECs with sFlt-1 reduced cell migration, but this was res-
cued with the addition of either esomeprazole or lansoprazole 
(Figure 5D). Therefore, we found that PPIs rescued endothe-
lial dysfunction in multiple in vitro assays.

stress and inflammation may help decrease disease sever-
ity. Administering PPIs to primary trophoblast cells induced 
nuclear translocation of the transcription factor, nuclear factor 
(erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2), to the nucleus (Figure 6A). 
One of the targets of Nrf2 is HO-1, which has antioxidant and 
cytoprotective actions.32 PPIs potently induced HO-1 expres-
sion in primary trophoblast (Figure 6B; Figure S8A), placental 
explants from women with preterm preeclampsia (Figure 6C), 
HUVECs (Figure 6D; Figure S8B), and uterine microvascular

quinone 1 and thioredoxin in HUVECs and trophoblasts, both 
antioxidant molecules that are Nrf2 targets (Figure S8D and

nous antioxidant molecules in placenta and endothelium.

chemokine ligand (CCL), CCL2 and CCL7 (Figure S9A). 
Furthermore, PPIs reduced secretion of cytokines from endo-
thelial cells treated with either TNF-α or preeclamptic serum 
to induce endothelial dysfunction (Figure S9B and S9C). 
These data suggest that PPIs can decrease cytokine secretion 
from placenta and endothelium.
Discussion
In this study, we have identified PPIs as candidate treatments 
for preeclampsia. They appear to have diverse biological 
actions that could be useful to block important pathophysi-
ological processes thought to occur in preeclampsia.2,5 PPIs 
decrease secretion of sFlt-1 and sENG from primary tropho-
blast, placental explants from normal and preeclamptic preg-
nancies, and from 2 types of primary endothelial cells. The 
PPI esomeprazole vasodilates human vessels from normal 
and preeclamptic pregnancies and reduces blood pressure in a 
transgenic mouse model where human sFlt-1 is overexpressed 
in placenta.
The ability of esomeprazole to vasodilate vessels ex vivo 
and reduce blood pressure in vivo may be mediated through 
the endothelium, perhaps by increasing p-eNOS expression. 
Indeed, for our preeclampsia animal model, we note that 
sFlt-1 is autonomously expressed in the placenta meaning it is 
unlikely PPIs can directly decrease placental sFlt-1 secretion 
in that experiment. Furthermore, PPIs seem to block endothe-
lial dysfunction in many in vitro assays. Finally, PPIs upregu-
late endogenous antioxidant molecules and decrease secretion 
of cytokines from placental tissues and endothelial cells.
We believe that our study has several strengths. We per-
formed a significant body of functional experiments on 7 
types of primary human tissues where we administered many 
PPIs at various doses. Importantly, we included vessels and 
placenta from cases of preterm preeclampsia and biological 
replicates were performed on samples from different patients. 
Hence we believe that the functional evidence we have gener-
ated is strong.
Although we have generated evidence suggesting that 
PPIs may alter molecular signaling involved in vessel dilation, 
we have not uncovered a unifying molecular mechanism to 
explain how PPIs have such diverse biological effects (ranging 
from vessel dilatation, decreasing sFlt-1 and sENG secretion

to decreasing endothelial dysfunction). It is unclear whether 
PPIs are exerting these effects by acting on one, or multiple 
molecular targets.
We have explored relevant pathways to determine the 
molecular mechanism by which PPIs decreased sFlt-1 and 
sENG. Initially, we embarked on these studies with the hypoth-
esis that PPIs may upregulate HO-114 and may reduce sFlt-1 
and sENG secretion given it had previously been proposed 
that HO-1 was central to preeclampsia and that HO-1 regu-
lates sFlt-1 and sENG production.13 However, we have since 
published data demonstrating that HO-1 is not decreased in 
preeclampsia and does not regulate placental sFlt-1 or sENG 
secretion. As such, we do not believe that the effects of sFlt-1 
and sENG are mediated by the ability of PPIs to upregulate 
HO-1. Instead, we examined V-ATPase enzyme (given PPIs 
were designed to inhibit this proton pump) and the ARF1 
and RAB11 cargo proteins (given a previous report suggest-
ing they shuttle sFlt-1 out of cells). We were unable to show 
that they mediate the decrease in sFlt-1 and sENG secretion 
induced by PPIs. We have ongoing studies to try to determine 
the molecular mechanisms behind the actions of PPIs, spe-
cifically the decrease in antiangiogenic factors, given such a 
discovery might yield new insights into new drug targets.
Ghebremariam et al33 reported that the PPI omeprazole 
reduced eNOS and p-eNOS (active eNOS) expression and 
reduced nitric oxide release from isolated veins. They pre-
sented a qualitative blot (without densitometric analysis) to 
suggest that omeprazole decreased eNOS protein expression, 
and experiments demonstrating omeprazole impaired vascular 
reactivity. Furthermore, they showed administrating lansopra-
zole to nonpregnant mice increased circulating asymmetrical 
dimethylarginine (antagonist of eNOS) although blood pres-
sure was not reported. In contrast, we generated a body of 
data to show the opposite that PPIs upregulate p-eNOS and 
induce vasodilation both ex vivo and in vivo. We administered 
different doses of esomeprazole or rabeprazole with or with-
out TNF-α stimulation, and in all cases, there was a signifi-
cant increase or a trend toward an increase in p-eNOS protein 
(quantitative densitometric analysis). Importantly, we also 
found that esomeprazole potently vasodilated whole maternal 
blood vessels and reduced blood pressure in an animal model 
of preeclampsia. Finally, we observed a possible trend toward 
a decrease in blood pressure when we administered esomepra-
zole to nonpregnant mice, but there was certainly no evidence 
that the blood pressure increased. It is difficult to reconcile our 
findings with Ghebremariam et al.33 Despite these conflicting 
findings, we suggest that clinical studies to explore the poten-
tial of PPIs to treat preeclampsia are well justified, given our 
preclinical data suggest that PPIs seem to have other biologi-
cal effects (besides vasorelaxation) that may also be beneficial 
in treating preeclampsia and there is strong epidemiological 
evidence to suggest PPIs are safe when administered during 
pregnancy (as discussed below).
We note that it is difficult to know how much drug is 
seen locally at target tissues. However, we would make some 
observations. First, the surface area of the target tissues (ves-
sel endothelium and placenta) is vast and easily accessible 
to circulating drugs. Second, we would anticipate that some 
decrease in sFlt-1 and sENG may be sufficient to affect the 
disease progression given these factors are present in normal 
pregnancies. It may not be necessary to block their secretion 
entirely. Third, we treated our mouse model (where sFlt-1 was 
overexpressed in the placenta) with esomeprazole at a dose 
that equates to ≈30 mg daily dosing in humans (using a for-
mula published by Reagan-Shaw et al34), and this completely 
abrogated an increase in blood pressure. Finally, we performed 
multiple dose–response studies using multiple PPIs to show 
that the various biological responses are present at a range of 
doses. Importantly, the doses we used are in the micromolar 
range; these doses were chosen because the PPIs are found in 
the circulation at these concentrations,35–37 thus we anticipate 
that this will be the range that is clinically effective. It may 
be worthwhile undertaking further in vitro studies using drug 
doses within the nanomolar range as these might shed further 
clues as to the mechanisms by which PPIs are exerting the 
diverse biological effects we have observed.
Recent data have emerged combining microarray or ultra-
sound findings with histopathology38 defining further subtypes 
of preeclampsia, highlighting the heterogeneity of the disease. 
Leavey et al39 found specific correlations with microarray data 
(from large cohorts of preeclamptic placentas) with clinical 
findings and propose subclasses of preeclampsia distinct to the 
canonical disease (which is driven by antiangiogenic factors). 
They identified a cluster of patients they coined immunologic 
preeclampsia where the main drivers of the disease may be 
immunologic.39 It is therefore possible that PPIs might be less 
effective for subtypes of preeclampsia where antiangiogenic 
factors play less of a role. As the field of preeclampsia subtyp-
ing matures, it may be feasible to stratify response to PPIs 
treatment in future clinical trials with preeclampsia subtyping.
There have been few orally available treatment options 
identified for preeclampsia that have reached clinical trials. 
In regards to treating preeclampsia, the field has perhaps 
been most focused on the potential use of pravastatin, a drug 
designed to inhibit cholesterol synthesis.19 There is preclinical 
evidence that pravastatin may have been useful to treat pre-
eclampsia.20,27,40 
A recent clinical trial of pravastatin to treat pre-
term preeclampsia has ceased recruitment and the results have 
yet to be published (unique identifier: ISRCTN23410175). A 
pharmacokinetic study of 20 participants has just been reported 
(unique identifier: NCT01717586).41 However, a potential 
drawback in using pravastatin is that it has been assigned cat-
egory X classification by the Food and Drug Administration. 
Although we agree that there are valid arguments to support 
the use of statins to treat pregnancies complicated by preterm 
preeclampsia, a drug that is thought to be safe in pregnancy 
will be more clinically acceptable.
In contrast to pravastatin, large epidemiological studies 
have demonstrated that PPIs are safe in pregnancy, where they 
are widely prescribed to relieve symptomatic gastric reflux in 
pregnancy.11,12 In 2010, Pasternak and Hviid11 examined the 
first trimester exposure, a time in pregnancy where there is 
significant organogenesis and the fetus is most vulnerable 
to teratogens. Examining 5082 pregnancies exposed to PPIs 
and 840 968 that were not exposed, they concluded that the 
first trimester exposure to PPIs was not associated with an 
increased risk of major birth defects.11 A systematic review 
published in 2009 (1530 pregnancies exposed to PPIs and

 Onda et al  Proton Pump Inhibitors to Treat Preeclampsia  467
133 410 nonexposed controls) did not identify an increase in 
congenital abnormalities.42 A subsequent large study exam-
ining 112 022 pregnancies (of which 1186 were exposed to 
PPIs) confirmed no increase in congenital anomalies, fetal 
growth restriction, or adverse neonatal outcomes (including 
preterm birth or low Apgar scores).12 Thus, large cohort stud-
ies indicate that PPIs are safe during pregnancy.
Given our preclinical data, and the reassuring epidemio-
logical data suggesting that PPIs are safe, it would seem justifi-
able to proceed to clinical trials to examine whether PPIs could 
be used to either prevent preeclampsia or treat women diag-
nosed with preeclampsia. As such, we are currently recruiting 
women with preterm preeclampsia to a phase II randomized 
clinical trial, The PIE trial (Preeclampsia Intervention With 
Esomeprazole).43 We will examine whether esomeprazole can 
safely prolong gestation in women diagnosed with preterm pre-
eclampsia and improve fetal, maternal, and neonatal outcomes.
Perspectives
We have shown in preclinical studies that PPIs potently 
decrease placental release of sFlt-1 and sENG, decrease endo-
thelial dysfunction, are vasodilatory and have antioxidant and 
anti-inflammatory properties. They may represent a potential 
therapeutic option for preeclampsia and perhaps other diseases 
where there is significant endothelial dysfunction. If PPIs are 
found to be useful to treat or prevent preeclampsia, they may 
significantly reduce maternal and perinatal mortality globally.

What Is New?
• Proton pump inhibitors decrease placental and endothelial secretion of 
soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 secretion and soluble endoglin.
• Proton pump inhibitors vasodilate whole vessels and rescues hyperten-
sion in a model of preeclampsia
• Proton pump inhibitors rescue endothelial dysfunction, upregulates anti-
oxidant genes, and decreases cytokine secretion from endothelial cells.
What Is Relevant?
• Preeclampsia is a serious complication of pregnancy characterized by 
hypertension, endothelial dysfunction, and multiorgan injury.
• Inflammation and oxidative stress exacerbate the endothelial injury.
• A drug that is safe in pregnancy that can block these processes could be 
used to treat or prevent preeclampsia.
Summary
We propose proton pump inhibitors are candidate drugs to prevent 
or treat preeclampsia, but clinical trials are needed.
