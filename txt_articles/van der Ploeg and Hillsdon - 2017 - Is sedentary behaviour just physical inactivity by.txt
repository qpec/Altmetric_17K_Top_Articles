Is sedentary behaviour just physical
inactivity by another name?
Hidde P. van der Ploeg1,2* and Melvyn Hillsdon3
Abstract
The relationship between sedentary behaviour and physical activity and their role in the development of health
conditions is an ongoing topic of research. This debate paper presents arguments in favour and against the statement:
“Is sedentary behaviour just physical inactivity by another name?” The paper finishes with recommendations for future
research in the field of sedentary behaviour, physical activity and public health.
Keywords: Sedentary behaviour, Physical activity, Public health
Background
Following an ever growing body of scientific literature,
sedentary behaviour has received considerable public
and media attention. Sedentary behaviour is defined as
any waking behaviour characterized by an energy ex-
penditure ≤1.5 METs while in a sitting, reclining or lying
posture [1, 2]. Within the scientific community there is
an ongoing discussion on how sedentary behaviour is
related to
physical activity,
and whether sedentary
behaviour is an independent risk factor for cardio-
metabolic health. At the 2016 HEPA Europe conference
in Belfast (Northern Ireland), this was the subject of a
scientific debate. The current paper summarizes both
the arguments in favour and against the general state-
ment of that debate: “Is sedentary behaviour just physical
inactivity by another name?”
Sedentary behaviour is not the same as physical
inactivity (Hidde van der Ploeg)
The answer to the question if ‘sedentary behaviour is
just physical inactivity by another name’ is of course
dependent on their respective definitions. With the def-
inition of sedentary behaviour already formulated in the
introduction above, this leaves us with the definition of
physical inactivity. In line with the widely adopted
Sedentary Behaviour Research Network definitions, most
research studies these days use the term inactive to de-
scribe people who are performing insufficient amounts
of moderate- and vigorous-intensity activity (MVPA), i.e.
not meeting specified physical activity guidelines [1, 2].
The WHO global recommendations on physical activity
for health state that “Adults aged 18–64 years should do
at least 150 min of moderate-intensity aerobic physical
activity throughout the week, or do at least 75 min of
vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity throughout
the week, or an equivalent combination of moderate-
and vigorous-intensity activity (MVPA) [3].” WHO de-
fined moderate-intensity physical activity as any activity
with a MET value between 3 and 5.9 and vigorous-
intensity physical activity as ≥6 MET.
Following this definition of inactivity, it becomes clear
that inactivity and sedentary behaviour are different con-
structs. Here is why. Nicole drives to work in the morn-
ing, sits behind her computer and in meetings all day at
work, drives back home and spends most of the evening
watching television with her family. That was a highly
sedentary day for Nicole. Nevertheless, it was not an in-
active day, as she also went running for 30 min, which
puts her on target to meet the WHO physical activity
recommendation. So Nicole was highly sedentary and
physically active on the same day. The opposite is also
possible. For example, people with a standing occupation
(e.g. hairdresser, shop sales person) will get little seden-
tary time during their day but might not do any MVPA.
Hence, they are inactive but not sedentary. In other
words, sedentary behaviour and inactivity are indeed two

 distinct constructs, and sedentary behaviour and MVPA
are not the inverse of each other.
Energy expenditure spectrum
Nevertheless, sedentary behaviour and MVPA are part of
the same energy expenditure spectrum. To meet the
WHO physical activity recommendation only around 2%
of our waking time needs to be spent in MVPA [3]. The
remaining 98% of our waking time is by definition spent
in sedentary behaviour and light intensity activity. Light
intensity activity is defined as any activity with an energy
expenditure between 1.5–3 MET, which includes both
static (e.g. standing) and ambulatory activities. Sedentary
behaviour and light intensity physical activity are highly
correlated and almost the inverse of each other.
In addition to meeting the MVPA public health rec-
ommendations, it is that balance between sedentary be-
haviour and light intensity physical activity that also
seems to be important for public health. In other words,
it might be important to consider all behaviours across
the energy expenditure spectrum, and not just the least
frequently practiced top end (MVPA), even though
(M)VPA might have the biggest health gains. This is
reflected in the inclusion of sedentary behaviour recom-
mendations in several recently updated national physical
activity
guidelines
[4–8].
The
energy
expenditure
spectrum argument is also responsible for the often in-
cluded ‘more is better’ message in recent physical activ-
ity recommendations. It is important to note that such
recommendations provide the public with an easy to
understand physical activity target, which does not rep-
resent a dichotomous cut off between non-beneficial
and highly beneficial MVPA levels.
Evidence from prospective cohort studies
In 2012, two large prospective cohort studies (N > 200,000)
from Australia and the US reported an association between
mortality and total sitting time (as proxy for sedentary time)
next to the well-documented association between mortality
and physical inactivity [9, 10]. These two cohort studies
and a subsequent meta-analysis including a total of six
studies suggested that sitting time in itself was not hazard-
ous but only in higher volumes [11]. The meta-analysis
showed that around 7–8 h of self-reported sitting per day,
the hazard ratios for all-cause mortality started to increase
significantly [11].This suggested that sitting was only prob-
lematic in high doses. Hence, it is important to realize that
sitting is a natural behaviour, which should not be demo-
nized or completely banned.
In the summer of 2016, the second special issue on
physical activity in the Lancet included a harmonised
meta-analysis of sitting time, physical activity and mor-
tality (i.e. all-cause, cardiovascular and cancer mortality)
[12]. The meta-analysis included well over a million
people who were apparently healthy at baseline and the
authors concluded that high levels of moderate intensity
physical activity seem to eliminate the increased risk of
death associated with high sitting time. In line with the
earlier meta-analysis, their results also suggested that
mortality hazard ratios (i.e. all-cause and cardiovascular
mortality) increase significantly from ~8 h of sitting per
day onwards. However, the results in the least active
group (≤2.5 MET-h/wk. of MVPA) seemed to suggest
there might be more of a dose-response relationship in
this group and lower levels of sitting time might already
be considered hazardous. An important implication of
this is that the inactive and high sedentary segment of
the population is at the highest risk and needs special at-
tention in public health efforts.
The good news in the Lancet meta-analysis was that
MVPA attenuated and even eliminated the detrimental
association between sitting and mortality. But how much
MVPA is needed to achieve this? The detrimental effects
of sitting were eliminated in the highest MVPA group,
who did ≥35.5 MET-h/wk. of MVPA. The equivalent of
meeting the WHO physical activity recommendation is
7.5 MET-h/wk. [3], which means that people would have
to do at least 4–5 times more than the WHO physical
activity recommendation to offset the detrimental effects
of sitting too much. From a public health point of view
doing 4–5 times as much as the WHO physical activity
recommendation seems feasible for only a small portion
of the population as many already struggle to meet the
WHO recommendation in itself. It has been estimated
that 31.1% of adults worldwide do not meet physical ac-
tivity recommendations [13], although such estimates
are highly dependent on study and assessment methods
[14]. Nevertheless, it is important to note that ‘at least 4-
5 times more than the WHO physical activity recom-
mendation’ is a rough estimate. There was substantial
heterogeneity in the included cohort studies in the
meta-analysis for both the MVPA assessment methods
(and associated measurement bias) and in the conse-
quently reported absolute MVPA levels. For this reason
the authors had to work with MVPA quartiles for each
individual study. These were then combined for all stud-
ies, leading to substantial heterogeneity of MVPA levels
in the different quartiles.
Better standardized or objective assessment of MVPA in
the included cohort studies would have led to a better es-
timate of the role of MVPA. Unfortunately, little objective
physical activity and sedentary behaviour data is available
in prospective cohort studies to date. However, the
available objective data reports findings similar to that
of the Lancet meta-analysis, which included mostly
self-reported
data.
The
accelerometer
data
from
NHANES (n = 4840) shows that increasing light-
intensity activity and reducing sedentary time are

 important to reduce the risk of mortality, particularly
for inactive adults [15].
Limitations of prospective cohort studies
Prospective cohort studies are of course not without
methodological limitations. Especially, the potential for
reverse
causality
and
residual
confounding
warrant
special attention. Reverse causality has been investigated
extensively in the discussed cohort studies, namely
through the exclusion of people with pre-existing disease
from the analyses, adjusting for health status, and
through sensitivity analyses excluding people who died
in the first few years of follow up. In order to minimize
residual confounding, adjustment for confounding in the
different prospective cohort studies has been rather ex-
tensive (often including confounders such as socioeco-
nomic status, health status, smoking, diet and BMI).
Although reverse causality and residual confounding can
never be ruled out in prospective cohort studies, the as-
sociation between sitting time and mortality (all-cause
and cardiovascular) has been rather consistent when
using the above described statistical adjustment methods
and sensitivity analyses. Finally, to date no clear candi-
date residual confounder has been identified that has
never been adjusted for in such cohort studies.
Another limitation is the lack of available prospective
cohort data around the potential role of different types
and patterns of sedentary behaviour. It is possible that
different patterns and types of sedentary behaviour
present somewhat different health risks. For example, it
is possible that reclining on the couch has different
health implications than sitting in your office chair
working hard behind your computer, and a small differ-
ence in energy expenditure between sitting while watch-
ing TV and sitting while typing has been reported [16].
Furthermore, a review of experimental lab studies has
suggested prolonged sitting might be more detrimental
for metabolic health than the same amount of sitting in
a more broken up pattern [17]. This seems to suggest
that it is not only the total volume of sitting that matters
for health but also the pattern in which sitting time is
accumulated.
Reducing sedentary behaviour
Although MVPA appears to attenuate the risks of seden-
tary behaviour, unrealistically large volumes of MVPA
appear to be needed from a public health point of view
to completely eliminate the risks of sedentary behaviour.
Furthermore, MVPA can only play a small role in the re-
duction of large volumes of sedentary time. To get a per-
son who is sedentary for 10 h/d and does no MVPA, to
meet the WHO physical activity recommendations is a
great accomplishment from an MVPA and health point
of view, but is also challenging from a behaviour change
point of view. Furthermore, the impact of increasing
MVPA on the volume of sedentary time is limited, as a
substantial increase of 0.5 h/d in MVPA results in a rela-
tevily small reduction in sedentary time to 9.5 h/d.
Hence, when trying to reduce sedentary behaviour, not
only MVPA should be targeted but also the light inten-
sity part of the energy expenditure spectrum. As dis-
cussed above the light intensity part of the energy
expenditure spectrum includes static (e.g. standing) and
ambulatory activities. The question is if any type of light
intensity activity (and especially standing) can have
health benefits when replacing sedentary behaviour.
Prospective cohort studies have reported inverse asso-
ciations between standing time and all-cause mortality
[18, 19]. However, little is known about the measure-
ment properties of methods used to assess standing
time in these studies and they might reflect upright
time rather than standing still time.
When looking more closely at standing, there is only
a small difference in energy expenditure with sitting
[16, 20]. For example, the physical activity compendium
rates ‘sitting, talking in person, on the phone, computer,
or text messaging, light effort’ as 1.5 MET and ‘stand-
ing, talking in person, on the phone, computer, or text
messaging, light effort’ as 1.8 MET [20]. However,
substituting a large volume of sitting with standing
throughout the day would still lead to a substantial
difference in energy expenditure over the whole day.
Furthermore, the difference in leg muscle activity be-
tween sitting and standing might also have different ef-
fects on cardio-metabolic health. A review of lab based
studies suggests that replacing sitting with light inten-
sity activity and even standing may be a stimulus suffi-
cient enough to induce acute favourable changes in
postprandial metabolic parameters [17].
Hence, more evidence is needed around the health
benefits of replacing sitting with standing. Sit-stand desk
pilot intervention studies have shown substantial reduc-
tions in sitting time due to almost exclusively increases
in standing time [21]. Full blown randomized controlled
trials evaluating such interventions might be able to pro-
vide more definite evidence of the cardio-metabolic
health effects of replacing sitting with standing time in
sedentary individuals.
Finally, it must be noted that prolonged standing has
its own health risks in the form of musculoskeletal prob-
lems such as low back pain [22]. Hence, standing all day
also has health risks and a good public health message
might be to alternate sitting, standing and other light,
moderate, and vigorous physical activity throughout the
day. This message also complements the occupational
health recommendation to include variation in posture
during work to reduce the risk of musculoskeletal com-
plaints [23].

 Conclusion
Sedentary behaviour is not physical inactivity by a differ-
ent name, but both should be targeted simultaneously in
public health strategies. Even though many questions
still remain, the accumulated epidemiological evidence
suggests high volumes of sedentary time have a negative
impact on especially cardio-metabolic health. Substantial
amounts of MVPA do not only have clear health benefits
but also attenuate the health risks of high volumes of
sedentary time. The inactive and highly sedentary seg-
ment of the population is at greatest risk of poor health
and needs special attention in public health efforts. From
a public health point of view, MVPA by itself is insuffi-
cient to eliminate the risks of sedentary behaviour. A more
integral public health recommendation might be to find a
healthy balance between sitting, standing and other light
intensity physical activity, and MVPA throughout the day.
Sedentary behaviour is just physical inactivity by
another name (Melvyn Hillsdon)
It has been claimed that sedentary behaviour (the pos-
ture of sitting and an energy expenditure ≤1.5 METs)
[2] is an independent risk factor for poor health. The
claim is based on a large number of studies that have
reported positive associations between sedentary behav-
iour and risk of cardio-metabolic diseases and all-cause
mortality [11, 24, 25]. Such studies have seemingly been
deemed sufficient for some countries to incorporate
guidelines for limiting sedentary behaviour alongside
their guidelines for physical activity [4, 6]. The publica-
tion of government guidelines on sedentary behaviour
would be entirely appropriate if the underpinning re-
search was robust, but if it is not robust then the guide-
lines
could
be
counter-productive
and
potentially
detrimental to public health. It is therefore crucial that
we examine the robustness of the evidence in order to
substantiate, or otherwise, the appropriateness of these
guidelines.
Although there is a large body of evidence reporting
associations between time spent in sedentary behaviours
and poor health, there is an increasing body of evidence
reporting no association [26–30]. It may also be the case
that there are more unpublished studies that have found
no association due to the tendency to view null findings
as less interesting and and less publishable compared to
the enthusiasm for studies with positive associations.
One of the main reasons for the equivocal findings is
likely due to differences in methodologies between those
that do and do not find an association. This article will
highlight three primary methodological limitations of
observational
studies
–
confounding,
causality
and
measurement error - and demonstrate the impact they
have in studies that do and do not address them.
Inadequate adjustment for confounding
The claim that sitting is an ‘independent’ risk factor im-
plies that there is something about the posture of sitting
that is detrimental to health and that the associated risk
is not simply reflecting very low levels of physical activ-
ity or other health-effecting behaviours that correlate
with sitting. If the true risk factor for future health is
sedentary behaviour, and not physical inactivity, then as-
sociations between sedentary behaviour and health out-
comes need to control for total physical activity. That is
“any bodily movement produced by skeletal muscles that
results in energy expenditure” with physical inactivity
the absence of this [31]. It is common in studies of the
association between sedentary behaviour and mortality
to assert that associations remain after adjustment for
physical activity [11]. Closer inspection of these studies
reveals that only certain types of physical activity have
been adjusted for rather than total physical activity. In
most cases only time spent in moderate-and-vigorous in-
tensity physical activity (MVPA: ≥3 METs) has been sta-
tistically adjusted for. Given MVPA only accounts for
approximately 10% of total physical activity [32], de-
pending on definition, this leaves the majority of physical
activity, at intensities < MVPA, unaccounted for even
though time spent in light intensity physical activity
(1.5–2.9 METs) is associated with improved health out-
comes [33] and is, crucially, strongly inversely co-
correlated with time spent sedentary - r = −0.99 to
−0.96 [34]. If no adjustment is made for light physical
activity then it is difficult to determine whether the asso-
ciation with poor health is due to more time sedentary
or less time in light activity. On the limited number of
occasions that total physical activity has been controlled
for, both cross-sectional and longitudinal associations
between sedentary behaviour and health outcomes are
attenuated toward the null [35, 36]. Furthermore, only
controlling for time spent above the threshold of moder-
ate intensity assumes that health benefits of physical ac-
tivity at 3.1 METs is the same as 12 METs which seems
highly unlikely [37]. If controlling for total volume of
physical activity attenuates associations between time
spent sedentary and health outcomes to the null then it
is most likely that sedentary behaviour is simply dis-
placing physical activity and it is the absence of physical
activity that is the underlying exposure not sedentary be-
haviour. The counter argument authors often give for
not controlling for total physical activity is that because
there are a finite number of minutes in each day, doing
so
would
lead
to
issues
of
complete
collinearity
(r = 1.00) between time spent sedentary and total time
in physical activity (not sedentary) [38]. The problem of
collinearity is only true if derived measures of physical
activity at different intensities are expressed in units of
time. If volume of work is the derived measure (counts

Page 4 of 8
 per minute or milli-g- seconds based from accelerome-
ters or kcal/min, MET-mins per week estimated from
self-reports) then the problem of collinearity is alleviated
as there is no finite upper limit.
Another fundamental limitation to the claim that sit-
ting is an independent risk factor is that not all types of
sitting have been shown to increase risk [36, 39]. In
fact, according to a systematic review, one of the most
common forms of sitting, occupational sitting, does not
appear to increase risk [40]. This would suggest that
the forms of sitting that have been shown to increase
risk may be due to confounding factors or a difference
in how the volume of sitting was accumulated. For ex-
ample, TV viewing is one type of sitting that has been con-
sistently reported to be associated with health outcomes
[39, 41] and yet that form of sitting is known to be associ-
ated with other behaviours such as snacking [42, 43].
Sitting for different purposes are likely to have specific
health related correlates that may confound associations
with health. For example, occupational social class is
likely to be related to occupational sitting, car ownership
and income with time sitting in cars and unhealthy
snacking whilst watching TV. Statistical adjustment for
socioeconomic correlates specific to the type of sitting
are rarely, if ever undertaken. This is an important limi-
tation as more time spent watching TV is associated
with low socioeconomic position [44] and lower socio-
economic position is a risk factor for negative health
outcomes [45]. Studies often do statistically control for
some aspects of dietary behaviour such as alcohol con-
sumption, fat consumption and energy intake. Although
general measures of unhealthy diet are correlated with
TV viewing time this is quite different from measuring
the food consumed during the period when viewing TV
[46]. Adjustment for general dietary habits may miss the
co-occurrence with TV viewing. More momentary as-
sessments of diet and sedentary behaviour may be re-
quired to better disentangle this association [47]. For
example, sitting to watch TV immediately after a large,
calorie dense meal may be more detrimental than sitting
before a meal or sitting at work an hour after breakfast
and a short walk on the way to work. Fully adjusting for
confounders might be expected to re-align associations
between time spent watching TV and health with those
reported with occupational sitting time and health.
An alternative explanation for the differences in risks
reported between health and TV viewing and other types
of sedentary behaviour is that the pattern of sitting is
more prolonged while watching TV and it is the long pe-
riods of uninterrupted sitting that confer the greatest
risk to health rather than total volume of sitting [48].
Evidence from experiments of breaks in prolonged sit-
ting are normally cited to substantiate this hypothesis
[49]. A meta-analysis of studies examining the effects of,
or relationship between, breaks in sedentary behaviour
and cardio-metabolic health reported that breaking up
continuous periods of sedentary behaviour with short
bouts of light intensity physical activity improved blood
glucose levels compared to continuous sitting, whereas
bouts of standing did not [50]. Rather than providing
evidence of the detrimental effects of uninterrupted pe-
riods of sedentary behaviour these results indicate that
short bouts of light intensity physical activity are benefi-
cial in reducing blood glucose levels. Even if it was the
case that only prolonged bouts of continuous sitting
were detrimental this would only be of public health sig-
nificance if it was prevalent in the general population ra-
ther than through manipulation/enforcement in the
laboratory. Objective data on patterns of sitting and
transitions to upright postures suggest that long uninter-
rupted periods of sitting are not common. In a study of
office workers 69% of weekday and 68% of weekend sit-
ting bouts lasted between 0 and 10 min and less than 5%
of total sitting bouts were longer than 30 min. Further,
the average number of transitions per hour was still
above 2 even during the evening when people were more
likely to be watching TV [51].
Assumptions about causality
Another important limitation in observational studies is
their inability to determine cause and effect, often be-
cause factors upstream on the causal pathway are not in-
cluded in the analysis. This limitation could certainly
pertain to the claim that sedentary behaviour leads to
poor health.
Antecedents of sitting may include cardiorespiratory
fitness (CRF) and Body Mass Index (BMI). Cross sec-
tional and longitudinal associations between sitting time
and cardio-metabolic risk factors have been shown to be
attenuated when CRF is controlled for [52, 53] and in a
longitudinal study of middle-aged adults, change in CRF
mediated the association between sedentary behaviour
and a cardio-metabolic risk score whereby the associ-
ation was only present in those with reduced fitness
[54]. It is possible therefore that low fit adults gradually
become less physically active which further reduces CRF
and leads to an increased risk of premature mortality.
The evidence also suggests that the link between sit-
ting and obesity can be explained by reverse causality –
obesity leads to more sitting but more sitting does not
lead to obesity. Prospective associations between seden-
tary behaviour and risk of developing obesity are weak
and inconsistent yet those between obesity and risk of
becoming inactive/sedentary are consistently stronger
[55]. Studies that fail to take account of these and other
potential antecedents could make incorrect inferences
regarding causality.

 Measurement error
Determining that sedentary behaviour is detrimental to
health and that the associated risk is not simply reflect-
ing a lack of physical activity requires precise measure-
ment of both behaviours and their correlates to avoid
misclassification. There are many measures, both self-
report and objective, of both behaviours. Most of these
do not have published validity and reliability data from
studies in free-living settings, especially measures of sed-
entary behaviour. Some authors report the time spent
below a specific level of acceleration, derived from wrist
or waist worn accelerometers, as a measure of the vol-
ume of sedentary behaviour [56]. This is misleading as
this is simply a measure of inactivity on the opposite
end of the same scale used to estimate physical activity.
Although accelerometers are available that can discrim-
inate between different postures and physical activity,
they are not yet widely used in population studies. Be-
cause patterns of both physical activity and sitting, along
with their relationship with other health behaviours, are
potentially as important as the volume of each behaviour
[57, 58], it is insufficient to simply report weekly or aver-
age daily volumes of each behaviour. A better under-
standing of the temporal sequence of bouts of physical
activity (of varying intensities and durations) would pro-
vide a more precise estimate of the attenuating effect of
both the volume and pattern of all physical activities on
the association between sedentary behaviour and health.
Failure to statistically adjust for the pattern of physical
activity, as well as the total volume, may still leave re-
sidual confounding that could be misinterpreted as an
‘independent association’.
Conclusion
The methodological limitations highlighted above also
apply to many studies of the association between phys-
ical activity and health and determining when the evi-
dence is sufficient for public health action requires a
balanced approach. However, the equivocal results from
observational studies and the substantial methodological
limitations highlighted in this paper do not support the
claim that sedentary behaviour leads to poor health and
the subsequent guidelines cannot currently be substanti-
ated. What we can safely say is that not moving (physical
inactivity) is bad for you but how you stay still probably
doesn’t matter.
Joint recommendations for future research
-Studies are advised to incorporate high quality assess-
ment methods for physical activity and sedentary behav-
iour, ideally using objective assessment methods but
preferably also including information on domains (e.g.
leisure, occupational, etc.), types (e.g. sitting on couch
watching TV) and context of behaviour.
-Studies are advised to take account of other factors
that may confound the association between specific sed-
entary behaviours and health outcomes.
-Study the role of different domains and types of sed-
entary behaviour with regard to health outcomes.
-Study the roles of total volume and patterns (bouts
and breaks) of both physical activity (at all intensities)
and sedentary behaviour with regard to health outcomes.
-Study the health effects of replacing sedentary behav-
iour with standing or light intensity physical activities.
-Study the dose-response relationships between phys-
ical activity, sedentary behaviour and health outcomes.
-Study the underlying physiological mechanisms of the
relationship between sedentary behaviour, physical activ-
ity and health outcomes.
-Conduct intervention studies to establish the direc-
tion of causality between sedentary behaviour, physical
activity and health outcomes.
Additional recommendations
Hidde van der Ploeg
-Studies are advised to use assessment methods and ana-
lysis techniques that take into account the energy ex-
penditure spectrum as a continuous measure of intensity
level, rather than grouping physical activity into categor-
ical intensity groups (light, moderate, vigorous), as this
can provide more accurate estimates of the relationship
with health.
-Studies should avoid over-adjustment for light inten-
sity activity when studying the relationship between sed-
entary behaviour and health, as light intensity activity is
by definition almost the inverse of sedentary behaviour.
Melvyn Hillsdon
-Studies testing the independent association between
sedentary behaviour and health are advised to adjust for
total volume of physical activity (in mg or counts, not
minutes), not just time spent in MVPA. Otherwise the
resulting association may simply be reflecting the benefi-
cial effects of doing more light intensity activity, not the
detrimental effect of more time spent sedentary.
