Background
The introduction of point-of-care devices for the management of patients on oral anticoagulation allows self-testing by the patient
at home. Patients who self-test can either adjust their medication according to a pre-determined dose-INR (international normalized
ratio) schedule (self-management), or they can call a clinic to be told the appropriate dose adjustment (self-monitoring). Increasing
evidence suggests self-testing of oral anticoagulant therapy is equal to or better than standard monitoring. This is an updated version
of the original review published in 2010.
Objectives
To evaluate the effects on thrombotic events, major haemorrhages, and all-cause mortality of self-monitoring or self-management of
oral anticoagulant therapy compared to standard monitoring.
Search methods
For this review update, we re-ran the searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), 2015, Issue 6, the
Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to June week 4 2015), Embase (Ovid, 1980 to 2015 week 27) on 1 July 2015. We checked
bibliographies and contacted manufacturers and authors of relevant studies. We did not apply any language restrictions .
Selection criteria
Outcomes analysed were thromboembolic events, mortality, major haemorrhage, minor haemorrhage, tests in therapeutic range,
frequency of testing, and feasibility of self-monitoring and self-management.
Data collection and analysis
Review authors independently extracted data and we used a fixed-effect model with the Mantzel-Haenzel method to calculate the
pooled risk ratio (RR) and Peto’s method to verify the results for uncommon outcomes. We examined heterogeneity amongst studies
with the Chi2 and I2 statistics and used GRADE methodology to assess the quality of evidence.

 Main results
We identified28randomisedtrialsincluding8950 participants(newlyincorporatedinthisupdate: 10 trialsincluding 4227 participants).
The overall quality of the evidence was generally low to moderate. Pooled estimates showed a reduction in thromboembolic events (RR
0.58, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.75; participants = 7594; studies = 18; moderate quality of evidence). Both, trials of self-management or self-
monitoring showed reductions in thromboembolic events (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.70; participants = 3497; studies = 11) and (RR
0.69, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.97; participants = 4097; studies = 7), respectively; the quality of evidence for both interventions was moderate.
No reduction in all-cause mortality was found (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.01; participants = 6358; studies = 11; moderate quality
of evidence). While self-management caused a reduction in all-cause mortality (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.84; participants = 3058;
studies = 8); self-monitoring did not (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.15; participants = 3300; studies = 3); the quality of evidence for both
interventions was moderate. In 20 trials (8018 participants) self-monitoring or self-management did not reduce major haemorrhage
(RR 0.95, 95% CI, 0.80 to 1.12; moderate quality of evidence). There was no significant difference found for minor haemorrhage
(RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.41; participants = 5365; studies = 13). The quality of evidence was graded as low because of serious risk
of bias and substantial heterogeneity (I2 = 82%).
Authors’ conclusions
Participants who self-monitor or self-manage can improve the quality of their oral anticoagulation therapy. Thromboembolic events
were reduced, for both those self-monitoring or self-managing oral anticoagulation therapy. A reduction in all-cause mortality was
observed in trials of self-management but not in self-monitoring, with no effects on major haemorrhage.

Self-monitoring and self-management of oral anticoagulation therapy
Background
Point-of-care testing devices have made it possible for people on long-term oral anticoagulation to monitor their blood clotting time,
measured as the international normalized ratio (INR). Patients who self-test can either adjust their medication dose according to a pre-
determined dose-INR schedule (self-management) or they can call a clinic to be told the appropriate dose adjustment (self-monitoring).
Several published studies and systematic reviews have suggested these methods of monitoring anticoagulation therapy may be equal to
or better than standard monitoring by a physician.
Study characteristics
This is an update of the original review published in 2010. We performed a new search and found 10 new studies (with 4227 participants)
to add to the original review, which changed some of the findings.
Main results
In total, we found 28 randomised trials including 8950 participants that compared self-monitoring and self-management with standard
monitoring. The quality of the evidence was generally low to moderate. The combined results of the 28 trials showed a halving of
thromboembolic events with self-monitoring and self-management and no reduction in the number of major bleeds. Self-management
had similar reductions in thromboembolic events and mortality to the overall benefit, with no effect on major bleeds. Self-monitoring
halved the number of major haemorrhages that occurred but did not significantly reduce the rates of thrombotic events or all-cause
mortality.
Conclusion
In conclusion, self-monitoring or self-management can improve the quality of oral anticoagulant therapy, leading to fewer thromboem-
bolic events and lower mortality, without a reduction in the number of major bleeds. Self-monitoring and self-management are not
feasible for all patients, which requires the identification and education of suitable patients.

*The basis for the assumed risk (e.g. the median control group risk across studies) is provided in footnotes. The corresponding risk (and its 95% confidence interval) is
based on the assumed risk in the comparison group and the relative effect of the intervention (and its 95% CI).
CI: Confidence interval; RR: Risk Ratio
GRADE Working Group grades of evidence
High quality: We are very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect.
Moderate quality: We are moderately confident in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is
substantially different.
Low quality: Our confidence in the effect estimate is limited: The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect.
Very low quality: We have very little confidence in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect
1 Downgraded from high to moderate because of serious risk of bias.

erminology
• Point-of-care testing (POC): diagnostic testing performed
in a clinic, home, or other site of patient care (rather than in
standard reference laboratory)
• Point-of-care device: portable monitor used by a healthcare
provider (physician, nurse, or other) or patient to determine a
clinical measure
• Self-monitoring: the trained participant uses point-of-care
testing to perform the international normalized ratio (INR) test
and inform his or her healthcare provider of the result. The
physician or another healthcare provider adjusts the
anticoagulant dose using the results obtained by the participant
• Self-management: trained participant uses point-of-care
testing to perform the INR test, interpret the result, and adjust
the dosage of anticoagulant accordingly (adapted from Brown
2007)
Description of the condition
Oral anticoagulation therapy has been shown to reduce throm-
boembolic events in atrial fibrillation, treatment of deep-vein
thrombosis, prosthetic heart valves, and acute myocardial infarc-
tion (Connolly 1991; Go 2003; SPAF 1996). Optimal anticoag-
ulation with warfarin or other vitamin K antagonists like aceno-
coumarol or phenprocoumon could potentially prevent more than
half of the strokes related to atrial fibrillation and heart valve re-
placements with a relatively low risk of major bleeding compli-
cations (Buckingham 2002; Hart 2007); however, much of this
potential is still not obtained because of under and suboptimal use
(Stafford 1998).
The numberof patientsreceivingoral anticoagulantdrugshasbeen
increasing. Reasons include improvements in clinical outcomes,
increasing common disease indications for their use (Manotti
2001), and improvements in anticoagulant safety (Ansell 2001).
In 1994, 250,000 patients in the UK were receiving anticoagulant
therapy (Baglin 1994); 10 years later this had increased to around
950,000 patients (Fitzmaurice 2005). Vitamin K antagonist (war-
farin, acenocoumarol, or phenprocoumon) treatment usually re-
quiresregularmonitoringof prothrombin time (PT)with dose-ad-
justment by a specialised hospital service, primary care physician,
registered nurse, nurse practitioner, or pharmacist (Hirsh 1998).
Numerous obstacles to the use of warfarin exist; including practi-
cal, patient, physician, and healthcare system-related barriers. Due
to the complex pharmacokinetics of warfarin, continuous mon-
itoring and dose adjustments are required. Different values and
preferences amongst physicians and patients about the relative im-
portance of bleeding and thromboembolic events, non-adherence
to drug treatment, drug interactions, and increased costs of mon-
itoring have significant roles to play in the management of anti-
coagulation therapy (Heneghan 2008).
Description of the intervention
Vitamin K antagonists belong to the drug class known as
coumarins and produce their anticoagulant effect by interfering
with the metabolism of vitamin K. There are various different
types of coumarins but warfarin is the most prescribed. Warfarin
has a high bioavailability (Breckenridge 1978), and is rapidly ab-
sorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, with maximal blood con-
centrations reached 90 minutes after oral administration. Warfarin
has a half-life of 36 to 42 hours; in the blood it is bound to plasma
proteins (mainly albumin). It accumulates in the liver where the
two isomers are metabolically transformed by different pathways
(Ansell 2004). An anticoagulation effect generally occurs within
24 hours of treatment imitation, and peak effect for warfarin takes
two to five days.
Another vitamin K antagonist is acenocoumarol, which has a sim-
ilar action to warfarin but differs in some pharmacological proper-
ties (for example, it has a shorter half-life Barcellona 1998). Phen-
procoumon is another vitamin K antagonist that has tradition-
ally been the oral anticoagulant of choice in Europe. It has sim-
ilar actions to other vitamin K antagonists but has a half-life of
144 hours. As a result of their pharmacokinetic properties, these
agents interact with many other drugs and their blood levels are
affected by vitamin K intake in the diet, changes in metabolism,
and concomitant illnesses, which makes the levels difficult to con-
trol (Greenblatt 2005).
The pharmacodynamics of warfarin are subject to genetic and en-
vironmental variability (Hirsh 2001), such that there is consid-
erable variation in the action of these drugs both between differ-
ent individuals (inter-individually) and within the same individ-
ual (intra-individually). A ’therapeutic target range’ has been es-
tablished to deal with this variability and is expressed as the in-
ternational normalized ratio (INR). This INR was established as
a standard way of reporting the prothrombin time (PT). Further-
more, using the INR formula (INR = patient PT/mean normal
PT) the ratio between patient PT and normal PT is calculated to
the power of the ISI (International Sensitivity Index), which is the
conversion factor for the used thromboplastin against the World
Health Organization (WHO) standard.
The ‘therapeutic range’ for anticoagulants is narrow. INR values
over 4.5 increase the risk of major bleeding and an INR less than 2
increases the risk of thromboembolism (Cannegieter 1995; Hylek
1996; Kearon 2003). The inter- and intra-individual variability
and the narrow target range generally requires frequent testing and
appropriate adjustment of the drug dose. In addition, time within
the therapeutic INR target range is highly dependent on the fre-
quency of testing (Horstkotte 1998). Different values and prefer-
ences amongst patients and physicians have also been described

 with the former willing to accept a much higher risk of bleeding
for an associated reduction in risk of stroke (Devereaux 2001).
An economic model analysed the cost of suboptimal oral antico-
agulation and showed the following. If 50% of those not receiving
warfarin prophylaxis had optimal anticoagulation, 19,380 emboli
would be prevented and 1.1 billion US dollars could be saved.
If 50% of those currently receiving warfarin as part of routine
medical care had optimal anticoagulation, 9852 emboli would be
prevented and 1.3 billion US dollars could be saved (Caro 2004).
How the intervention might work
Current models of oral anticoagulation management within the
UK include the traditional hospital outpatient model and various
forms of community-based models, all requiring patient atten-
dance at a clinic (Fitzmaurice 2002). In other countries, such as
Canada, a primary care physician monitors the INR and adjusts
the warfarin dose (Sunderji 2004).
The introduction of point-of-care devices allows the patient to
self-test at home with a drop of whole blood. Portable monitors
for monitoring long-term oral anticoagulation were introduced
in the 1990s. Devices have proved to be reliable with regard to
analytical accuracy, although INR measurements tend to be lower
with the portable coagulometers compared to laboratory analysers
(Christensen 2009; Poller 2006), and have proved to be reliable
devices for monitoring INR when checked regularly (Barcellona
2009).
Generally, patients receive a structured educational programme
given by the nurses or physicians responsible for their care. In ad-
dition, they receive training in self-testing, instructions to prevent
bleeding and thromboembolic complications, and are made aware
of the effects of diet and medications. Patients who self-test can
either adjust their therapy according to a pre-determined dose-
INR schedule (self-management) or they can call a clinic to be
told the appropriate dose adjustment (self-monitoring).
Why it is important to do this review
In some countries, such as Germany, self-monitoring and self-
management with portable monitors are established therapeutic
methods. There are several available point-of-care devices and the
most well known is the CoaguChek® monitor. Other available
monitors are the ProTime® Microcoagulation System, INRatio®
Monitor, Hemochron Junior Signature, and the TAS near-patient
test system. Potential advantages of self-monitoring and self-man-
agement include improved convenience for patients, better treat-
ment adherence, more frequent monitoring, and fewer throm-
boembolic and haemorrhagic complications (Taborski 1999).
Near-patient testing devices have made self-testing of antico-
agulation therapy with vitamin K antagonists possible. Guide-
lines generally do not endorse self-monitoring or self-manage-
ment (Fitzmaurice 2001), despite several authors of trials suggest-
ing this approach may be equal to or better than standard moni-
toring (Anderson 1993; Cromheecke 2000; Sawicki 1999). A re-
cent study suggested that self-monitoring and self-management
are cost-effective strategies for those receiving long-term oral an-
ticoagulation (Regier 2006). In addition, newer oral anticoagu-
lants that do not require monitoring have not been established in
heart valve patients (Eikelboom 2013) and are not suitable for all
because of the numerous exclusion and individuals who cannot
tolerate these drugs (DiNicolantonio 2012).
To establish the current strength of the available evidence, we up-
dated our systematic review of the impact of patient self-moni-
toring or self-management on treatment with oral anticoagulation
therapy.

Criteria for considering studies for this review
Types of studies
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the therapeutic ef-
fectiveness and safety of self-monitoring or self-management of
oral anticoagulation therapy.
Types of participants
All patients, adults and children, on long-term anticoagulant ther-
apy (treatment duration longer than two months), irrespective of
the indication for treatment (for example, valve replacement, ve-
nous thromboembolism, atrial fibrillation).
Types of interventions
Self-monitoring or self-management of oral anticoagulation com-
pared with:
• control of and dosage by personal physician;
• anticoagulation managed services (hospital anticoagulation
service);
• anticoagulation clinics (management conducted by
registered nurses, nurse practitioners, or pharmacists using
dosage-adjustment protocols).

 Types of outcome measures
Primary outcomes
• Thromboembolic events
• All-cause mortality
• Major haemorrhage (e.g. haemorrhage requiring hospital
admission or transfusion)
• Time in range, and proportion of measurements within the
therapeutic range for each particular condition
Secondary outcomes
• Minor haemorrhage (e.g. bleeding after minor trauma, nose
bleed)
• Frequency of testing
• Feasibility of testing: participant factors (e.g. physical
limitations), and non-participant factors (e.g. inability to attend
training)
• Quality of life and general satisfaction with treatment
Search methods for identification of studies
Electronic searches
The searches for the initial review were run in November 2007
(Appendix 1). We re-ran the searches on 27 November 2013
(Appendix 2). We updated the searches on 1 July 2015 (Appendix
2) with exception of CINAHL which was last searched on 27
November 2013 (an updated search of CINAHL was not manda-
tory):
• Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials
(CENTRAL) 2015, Issue 6, the Cochrane Library,
• MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to June week 4 2015),
• Embase (Ovid, 1980 to 2015 week 27), and
• CINAHL (EBSCO, 1982 to November 2013).
We limited our searches to randomised controlled trials by using
a maximally sensitive strategy (Dickersin 1994; Lefebvre 1996 in
2007 and Lefebvre 2011 in 2015).
Searching other resources
We also searched for ongoing trials on the UK National Re-
search Register (webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk), Trials Cen-
tral, Current Controlled Trials (www.controlled-trials.com/mrct/)
(November 2013) and handsearched reference lists of all retrieved
papers. We contacted Roche® Diagnostics (one manufacturer of
PT and INR monitors) in order to identify further published and
unpublished studies. There were no language restrictions.
Data collection and analysis
Data extraction
Two review authors (EAS and IJO) screened studies for inclusion
and retrieved all potentially relevant studies. Three review authors
(JM, PA, CH) independently extracted data on study population,
intervention, pre-specified outcomes, methodology, and quality
from eligible trials. The authors were not blinded to any aspect of
the studies (for example, journal type, authors’ names, institution).
We resolved disagreements by consensus. If needed, we sought
additional information from trial authors. We used Cohen’s kappa
to assess agreement between the two authors on the selection of
articles for inclusion.
We extracted information on disease characteristics and training
provided to the different groups. In the self-management group,
we extracted information on the actions participants subsequently
undertook.We extractedthe characteristicsof the populationstud-
ied, including the number of, and reasons for, participants not
entering the trial (for example, refusal or exclusion). Additionally,
we sought information on the reasons for discontinuation by par-
ticipants allocated to the intervention.
In the case of cross-over studies, the outcomes of interest are po-
tentially confounded by the cross-over and we only used data from
the first part of the trial (before cross-over).
Quality assessment
Three review authors (EAS, IJO, CH) independently extracted
methodological information for the assessment of risk of bias.
They used the following five components: method of randomi-
sation, concealment of allocation, intention-to-treat, number of,
and reasons for, participant losses to follow-up, and blinding. We
performed a sensitivity analyses for study quality by including only
those studies with clear methods of randomisation and conceal-
ment of allocation (high-quality studies). We also used the Grades
of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation
(GRADE) (GRADE 2008) to assess the quality of the included
studies.
Quantitative data synthesis
For the analysis we used Review Manager (RevMan) Version 5.3.
For the statistical analysis we calculated risk ratios (RRs) and 95%
confidence intervals (CIs) as summary statistics. We used a fixed-
effect model with the Mantzel-Haenzel method to calculate the
pooled odds ratio; and Peto’s method to verify the results in un-
common outcomes. We examined heterogeneity amongst stud-
ies with the Chi2 and I2 statistics (Higgins 2003). Where sig-
nificant heterogeneity existed, we used the random-effects model
(DerSimonian 1986).
We examined publication bias by constructing a funnel plot of
precision (SE of the log RR) against RR for the endpoints of major
7

 haemorrhage and thromboembolic episodes. We performed a sen-
sitivity analysis by excluding studies with high risk of bias and pre-
specified subgroup analyses according to clinical indication (me-
chanical valve replacement or atrial fibrillation), and self-monitor-
ing or self-management therapy. We performed a post-hoc sub-
group analysis according to who provided the control group care
(specialist anticoagulation clinic, family physician). Meta-regres-
sion in STATA tested any subgroup interaction on the outcomes.
The ratio of the average test frequency per individual patient/year
between intervention and control groups was calculated and lin-
ear regression was used to assess the association with study du-
ration. Pooling of the mean percentage of tests in the therapeu-
tic range was not possible; results were summarised using means
and ranges. We tested subgroup interactions using meta-regression
(Intercooled STATA 9.1 for Windows).
To provide further insight into the adequacy of the total sample
size across all trials, we calculated a posteriori the optimal infor-
mation needed for our meta-analysis (Pogue 1997). To determine
this optimal information size, we assumed a 2% risk of throm-
boembolism (median control event rate from trials in the review)
and a 50% RR reduction with a power of 95% and a two-sided
alpha = 0.01.

Description of studies
Results of the search
The search for the initial review retrieved 463 citations, which
included 18 relevant trials. The updated searches in November
2013 and July 2015 identified 5136 new citations and identified
an additional 10 trials (with 4227 participants) for inclusion.
In total, we identified 5894 citations through database searching as
well as one additional unpublished citation (Kaatz Unpublished).
Of these, we excluded 758 duplicate records, leaving 5136 po-
tentially relevant studies. A further 5067 citations were removed
after being deemed irrelevant to our research question. We inde-
pendently assessed 69 full-text articles for eligibility. Of these, 22
articles were excluded and 20 articles were secondary publications
of primary studies already included in the review (Figure 1).

Flowchart showing the results of combined searches
Included studies
A total of 27 included publications provided data on 28 trials in-
cluding 8950 participants (one publication, Gadisseur 2003 Self
mge; Gadisseur 2003 Self monit, contained data on two trials that
compared self-monitoring or self-management of oral anticoagu-
lation with standard monitoring). Trials were published between
1989 and 2013 and were largely undertaken in Europe (five each
in UK and Germany; three each in the Netherlands and Denmark;
one in each of Ireland, France, Spain and Austria); seven were un-
dertaken in United States and Canada; and one was conducted
in Australia. In total, 4723 participants on long-term anticoag-
ulation were included in our analysis. Three trials (Cromheecke
2000; Grunau 2011; Ryan 2009) used a cross-over design. The
remaining 25 trials were parallel design; this included the unpub-
lished study for which we were given access to the complete data
by the authors (Kaatz Unpublished).
One trial (Gadisseur 2003 Self mge; Gadisseur 2003 Self monit)
presented results on four groups. One group used self-manage-
ment therapy (Gadisseur 2003 Self mge), one used self-monitor-
ing therapy (Gadisseur 2003 Self monit). The two other arms with
no self-monitoring were combined (trained and untrained partic-
ipants) to provide an overall control group and were then subdi-
vided for the independent comparisons.
Six trials included only participants on life-long anticoagula-

 tion therapy following mechanical valve insertion (Azarnoush
2009; Horstkotte 1998; Körtke 2001; Sidhu 2001; Soliman
Hamad 2009; Thompson 2013); two trials included partici-
pants on long-term anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation (Khan
2004; Voller 2005); 20 trials included participants on long-
term anticoagulation for any indication (Beyth 2000; Christensen
2006; Christensen 2011; Cromheecke 2000; Dignan 2013;
Fitzmaurice 2002; Fitzmaurice 2005; Gadisseur 2003 Self mge;
Gadisseur 2003 Self monit; Gardiner 2005; Grunau 2011; Kaatz

2009; Sawicki 1999; Siebenhofer 2007; Sunderji 2004; Verret
2012; White 1989). In 15 trials the intervention group used
self-management (Christensen 2006; Cromheecke 2000; Dignan
2013; Fitzmaurice 2002; Fitzmaurice 2005; Grunau 2011; Körtke
2001; Menendez-Jandula 2005; Sawicki 1999; Sidhu 2001;
Siebenhofer 2007; Soliman Hamad 2009; Sunderji 2004; Verret
2012; Voller 2005) and 12 trials used self-monitoring (Azarnoush
2009; Beyth 2000; Christensen 2011; Gardiner 2005; Horstkotte
1998; Kaatz Unpublished; Khan 2004; Matchar 2010; Rasmussen
2012; Ryan 2009; Thompson 2013; White 1989). One further
study (Gadisseur 2003 Self mge; Gadisseur 2003 Self monit),
reported information on both self-management and self-moni-
toring groups. Eleven trials used primary care for the control
group (Beyth 2000; Fitzmaurice 2002; Grunau 2011; Horstkotte
1998; Körtke 2001; Rasmussen 2012; Sawicki 1999; Sidhu 2001;
Sunderji 2004; Thompson 2013; Voller 2005); 13 studies used
specialist anticoagulation clinics (Christensen 2011; Cromheecke
2000; Fitzmaurice 2005; Gadisseur 2003 Self mge; Gadisseur
2003 Self monit; Gardiner 2005; Kaatz Unpublished; Khan 2004;
Matchar 2010; Menendez-Jandula 2005; Ryan 2009; Soliman
Hamad 2009; Verret2012; White 1989); and one trial (Azarnoush
2009) used a medical analysis laboratory. In the three remain-
ing trials participants in the control group could use either pri-
mary care or specialist clinics (Christensen 2006; Dignan 2013;
Siebenhofer 2007). Duration of studies varied from two months
(White 1989) to more than 24 months (Körtke 2001; Matchar
2010); the mean duration was 12 months.
Analysis of publication bias using funnel plots of major haemor-
rhage and thromboembolic events showed no evidence of asym-
metry (Figure 2, Figure 3).

Risk of bias in included studies
The reportedriskof biaswasgenerallylowtomoderate.The nature
of the intervention made blinding of the allocation of intervention
to the participants impossible, although blinding of study staff
and outcome assessment was possible. We contacted nine authors
of the 27 included trials for additional details of randomisation
process, concealment of allocation, and blinding. The additional
information provided generally raised our ratings of the quality of
the trial, indicating that authors had met methodological criteria.
We also obtained valuable validity information from the ACP
Journal Club structured reviews on two occasions. ACP reviews
contact study authors when needed and are a valuable source of
additional information for validity issues.
After the addition of extra information supplied by authors, 11
trials were judged to be of high risk of bias (Azarnoush 2009;
Christensen 2011; Gardiner 2005; Khan 2004; Matchar 2010;
Rasmussen 2012; Sidhu 2001; Soliman Hamad 2009; Thompson
2013; Verret 2012; White 1989) and were removed in the sensi-
tivity analysis. These 11 trials did not perform intention-to-treat
analyses and randomisation and/or allocation concealment was
unclear. Overall, the available evidence was judged to be moder-
ate according to the GRADE Working Group grades of evidence
(Summary of findings for the main comparison). This was due
to flaws in study design; most commonly there was an absence of
information about the allocation concealment procedure or blind-
ing and the number of events was less than 300 for the primary
outcomes (Characteristics of included studies). The overall risk of
bias graph and summary table are shown in Figure 4 and Figure
5.

 Randomisation and allocation concealment
Twenty-one trials reported adequate information about the
randomisation process (Christensen 2006; Christensen 2011;
Cromheecke 2000; Dignan 2013; Fitzmaurice 2002; Fitzmaurice
2005; Gadisseur 2003 Self mge; Gadisseur 2003 Self monit;
Grunau 2011; Kaatz Unpublished; Khan 2004; Körtke 2001;
Menendez-Jandula 2005; Rasmussen 2012; Ryan 2009; Sawicki
1999; Sidhu 2001; Siebenhofer 2007; Sunderji 2004; Voller 2005;
White 1989) and were therefore judged to be of low risk of bias
in this domain.
However, the method of allocation concealment was generally not
reported in the published papers. After contacting authors for ad-
ditional information,14of the 28trialshadanappropriate method
of concealment (Beyth 2000; Christensen 2006; Cromheecke
2000; Fitzmaurice 2002; Fitzmaurice 2005; Gadisseur 2003 Self
mge; Gadisseur 2003 Self monit; Kaatz Unpublished; Körtke
2001; Menendez-Jandula 2005; Ryan 2009; Siebenhofer 2007;
Sunderji 2004; Voller 2005). Four studies used both conceal-
ment of allocation and intention-to-treat (Christensen 2006;
Fitzmaurice 2005; Menendez-Jandula 2005; Siebenhofer 2007)
(see Figure 4 and Figure 5).
Blinding
Participant blinding was not possible due to the nature of the inter-
vention. Seven studies included information about blinding. Two
trials blinded data collectors (Beyth 2000; Sawicki 1999), three
blinded healthcare providers (Gadisseur 2003 Self mge; Gadisseur
2003 Selfmonit; Rasmussen 2012), and six trials blinded outcome
assessors (Cromheecke 2000; Dignan 2013; Fitzmaurice 2005;
Grunau 2011; Menendez-Jandula 2005; Siebenhofer 2007) (see
Figure 4 and Figure 5).
Follow-up
Of those assigned to the intervention, 25% (range 0% to
57%) stopped self-monitoring or self-management by the end of
the trial. Nine trials used an intention-to-treat analysis (Beyth
2000; Dignan 2013; Fitzmaurice 2005; Grunau 2011; Kaatz
Unpublished; Matchar 2010; Menendez-Jandula 2005; Sawicki
1999; Sunderji 2004). All included studies described appropriate
participant follow-up (see Figure 4 and Figure 5).
Financial support
Eight studies (Beyth 2000; Cromheecke 2000; Grunau 2011;
Horstkotte 1998; Kaatz Unpublished; Körtke 2001; Soliman
Hamad 2009; Thompson 2013) did not describe financial sup-
port. Six studies were supported by grants from professional as-
sociations or national agencies (Christensen 2006; Fitzmaurice
2005; Khan 2004; Matchar 2010; Sunderji 2004; White 1989).
Twelve studies (Azarnoush 2009; Fitzmaurice 2002; Gadisseur
2003 Self mge; Gadisseur 2003 Self monit; Gardiner 2005;
Menendez-Jandula 2005; Ryan 2009; Sawicki 1999; Sidhu 2001;
Siebenhofer 2007; Verret 2012; Voller 2005) were part funded by
an unrestricted research grant from industry or received the co-
agulometer and strips for utilisation during the study. One study
was funded by a private hospital (Christensen 2011); and two by
a combination of government and private agencies (Dignan 2013;
Rasmussen 2012).

Primary endpoints
Thromboembolic events
Twenty-six trials reported thromboembolic outcomes; however,
eight trials showed no events in either the intervention or con-
trol arm (Christensen 2006; Dignan 2013; Gadisseur 2003 Self
mge; Gadisseur 2003 Self monit; Gardiner 2005; Grunau 2011;
Khan 2004; Verret 2012), and were therefore not included in
the pooled analysis (chapter 16.9.3, Higgins 2011). Eighteen
trials provided the information to calculate the overall effect
size (Azarnoush 2009; Beyth 2000; Cromheecke 2000; Dignan
2013; Fitzmaurice 2005; Horstkotte 1998; Kaatz Unpublished;
Körtke 2001; Matchar 2010; Menendez-Jandula 2005; Ryan
2009; Sawicki 1999; Sidhu 2001; Siebenhofer 2007; Soliman
Hamad 2009; Sunderji 2004; Voller 2005; White 1989).
Compared to standard therapy, self-monitoring or self-manage-
ment reduced thromboembolic events (risk ratio (RR) 0.58, 95%
confidence interval (CI) 0.45 to 0.75; participants = 7594; studies
= 18) (Analysis 1.1). The overall quality of evidence was down-
graded from high to moderate because of serious risk of bias
(Summary of findings for the main comparison). The findings
were not affected by the removal of the five trials deemed to have
high risk of bias (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.69; participants =
4558; studies = 13) (Analysis 1.3).
In those groups that self-managed (Cromheecke 2000;
Fitzmaurice 2005; Körtke2001; Menendez-Jandula 2005; Sawicki
1999; Soliman Hamad 2009; Sidhu 2001; Siebenhofer 2007;
Sunderji 2004; Verret 2012; Voller 2005), the effect was larger
(RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.70; participants = 3497; studies =

 11; Summary of findings 3) than in the groups that self-moni-
tored (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.97; participants = 4097; stud-
ies = 7); Summary of findings 2) (Azarnoush 2009; Beyth 2000;
Horstkotte 1998; Kaatz Unpublished; Matchar 2010; Ryan 2009;
White 1989). In either group, the quality of the evidence was
downgraded from high to moderate because of serious risk of bias.
However, the subgroup interaction was non-significant (P = 0.66).
Compared to standard therapy, self-monitoring or self-man-
agement in patients with mechanical valves (Azarnoush 2009;
Horstkotte 1998; Körtke 2001; Sidhu 2001; Soliman Hamad
2009; Thompson 2013) resulted in a significant effect on throm-
boembolic events (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.90; participants =
1816; studies = 6) (Analysis 1.2). The post-hoc subgroup analysis
for specialised care (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.90; participants
= 4947; studies = 8) and family physician care (RR 0.56, 95%
CI 0.38 to 0.84; participants = 2397; studies = 8) (Analysis 1.4)
showed both to be significant (subgroup interaction P = 0.33).
All-cause mortality
Twenty-two trials reported information on mortality; 11 trials did
not report any deaths in the intervention and control groups and
are therefore excluded form the pooled analysis (Azarnoush 2009;
Christensen 2006; Christensen 2011; Dignan 2013; Horstkotte
1998; Kaatz Unpublished; Khan 2004; Sunderji 2004; Verret
2012; Voller 2005; White 1989) (chapter 16.9.3, Higgins 2011).
Eleven trials (Beyth 2000; Fitzmaurice 2002; Fitzmaurice 2005;
Gardiner 2005; Körtke 2001; Matchar 2010; Menendez-Jandula
2005; Sawicki 1999; Sidhu 2001; Siebenhofer 2007; Soliman
Hamad 2009) reported all-cause mortality events. No reduction in
all-cause mortality was found (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.01; par-
ticipants = 6358; studies = 11) (Analysis 2.1). The overall quality
of evidence was downgraded from high to moderate because of se-
rious risk of bias (Summary of findings for the main comparison).
Removal of three studies deemed to have high risk of bias resulted
in no difference of the effect (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.02;
participants = 6160; studies = 8) (Analysis 2.3). In three stud-
ies of participants with mechanical valves (Körtke 2001; Sidhu
2001; Soliman Hamad 2009) self-monitoring or self-management
showed a significant reduction in mortality (RR 0.50, 95% CI
0.29 to 0.86; participants = 1295; studies = 3) (Analysis 2.2).
Two studies (Khan 2004; Voller 2005) reported on participants
with atrial fibrillation, no deaths were reported. A reduction in
mortality occurred in participants who self-managed (Fitzmaurice
2002; Fitzmaurice 2005; Körtke 2001; Menendez-Jandula 2005;
Sawicki 1999; Sidhu 2001; Siebenhofer 2007; Soliman Hamad
2009) compared to standard therapy (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.36 to
0.84; participants = 3058; studies = 8) (Analysis 2.1). The overall
quality of evidence was downgraded from high to moderate be-
cause of serious risk of bias (Summary of findings 3). No effect was
found for the self-monitoring only trials (Beyth 2000; Gardiner
2005; Matchar 2010) (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.15; participants
= 3300; studies = 3) (Analysis 2.1); The overall quality of evidence
was downgraded from high to moderate because of serious risk of
bias (Summary of findings 2). The subgroup interaction was sig-
nificant (P = 0.02). The post-hoc subgroup analysis for specialised
care (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.13; participants = 4387; studies
= 5) and family physician care (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.90;
participants = 1776; studies = 5) (Analysis 2.4) showed only family
physician care to be significant; however the subgroup interaction
was not significant (P = 0.06).
Major haemorrhage
Twenty-four trials reported major haemorrhage outcomes, four of
which did not report any events (Christensen 2006; Cromheecke
2000; Gardiner 2005; White 1989). Twenty trials provided
the information to calculate the overall effect size (Azarnoush
2009; Beyth 2000; Dignan 2013; Fitzmaurice 2002; Fitzmaurice
2005; Gadisseur 2003 Self mge; Gadisseur 2003 Self monit;
Horstkotte 1998; Kaatz Unpublished; Khan 2004; Körtke 2001;
Matchar 2010; Menendez-Jandula 2005; Sawicki 1999; Sidhu
2001; Siebenhofer 2007; Soliman Hamad 2009; Sunderji 2004;
Verret 2012; Voller 2005). Compared to standard therapy, self-
monitoring or self-management were associated with no reduction
in major haemorrhage (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.12; partici-
pants = 8018; studies = 20) (Analysis 3.1). The overall quality of
evidence was downgraded from high to moderate because of seri-
ous risk of bias (Summary of findings for the main comparison).
After removal of the six studies deemed to have high risk of bias,
the result remained similar (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.14; par-
ticipants = 7337; studies = 14) (Analysis 3.3). In terms of clini-
cal condition, four studies (Horstkotte 1998; Körtke 2001; Sidhu
2001; Soliman Hamad 2009) included participants with mechan-
ical valves only and two studies (Khan 2004; Voller 2005) reported
on participants with atrial fibrillation. No significant differences
were found.The inability to distinguish between the two condi-
tions in the remaining trials meant there was insufficient power to
determine significance by clinical condition (Analysis 3.2).
In those who self-monitored (Azarnoush 2009; Beyth 2000;
Gadisseur 2003 Self mge; Horstkotte 1998; Kaatz Unpublished;
Khan 2004; Matchar 2010), there was no significant reduction in
the number of events that occurred compared to standard ther-
apy (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.09; participants = 4038; studies
= 7). The quality of the evidence was downgraded from high to
low because of serious risk of bias and strong suspicion of publi-
cation bias (Summary of findings 2). Self-management (Dignan
2013; Fitzmaurice 2002; Fitzmaurice 2005; Gadisseur 2003 Self
monit; Körtke 2001; Menendez-Jandula 2005; Sawicki 1999;
Sidhu 2001; Siebenhofer 2007; Soliman Hamad 2009; Sunderji
2004; Verret 2012; Voller 2005) was comparable with standard
therapy (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.47; participants = 3980;
studies = 13) (Analysis 3.1). The subgroup interaction for this
outcome, between the two groups, was not significant (P = 0.32).

 The quality of the evidence was downgraded from high to low
because of serious risk of bias and imprecision of effect estimate
(Summary of findings 3). The post-hoc subgroup analysis for spe-
cialised care (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.19; participants = 5054;
studies = 9) and family physician care (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.66 to
1.30; participants = 2267; studies = 8) showed no effect (subgroup
interaction P = 0.79).
T
ests in range
Sixteen trials reported results of mean international normalized
ratio (INR) within target range (Cromheecke 2000; Fitzmaurice
2002; Gadisseur 2003 Self mge; Gadisseur 2003 Self monit;
Grunau 2011; Horstkotte 1998; Kaatz Unpublished; Körtke
2001; Menendez-Jandula 2005; Sawicki 1999; Sidhu 2001;
Siebenhofer 2007; Soliman Hamad 2009; Sunderji 2004; Voller
2005; White 1989). All studies but one (Kaatz Unpublished),
reported improvements in the self-monitoring or self-manage-
ment groups; six were statistically significant (Horstkotte 1998;
Körtke 2001; Menendez-Jandula 2005; Sidhu 2001; Voller 2005;
White 1989). Pooling of the mean percentage of tests in range was
not possible as information was collected in two different ways:
as the percentage of overall tests in range (Cromheecke 2000;
Fitzmaurice 2002; Horstkotte 1998; Körtke 2001; Sawicki 1999;
Sidhu 2001; Sunderji 2004; Voller 2005; White 1989), and the
percentage of tests for each individual in range (Gadisseur 2003
Self mge; Gadisseur 2003 Self monit; Menendez-Jandula 2005;
Ryan 2009). Improvements ranged from 3% to 21%. Eighteen
trials reported the percentage time within range (Azarnoush 2009;
Beyth 2000; Christensen 2006; Christensen 2011; Fitzmaurice
2002; Fitzmaurice 2005; Gardiner 2005; Grunau 2011; Kaatz
Unpublished; Khan 2004; Matchar 2010; Menendez-Jandula
2005; Rasmussen 2012; Sidhu 2001; Siebenhofer 2007; Sunderji
2004; Thompson 2013; Verret 2012). Seven studies (Azarnoush
2009; Beyth 2000; Christensen 2011; Matchar 2010; Sidhu 2001;
Siebenhofer 2007; Thompson 2013) reported a significant im-
provement in the time in therapeutic range in the self-monitoring
or self-management groups (see additional tables, Table 1).
The method used to estimate the time within therapeutic INR
target range in 16 studies was linear interpolation (Beyth 2000;
Christensen 2006; Fitzmaurice 2002; Fitzmaurice 2005; Gardiner
2005; Grunau 2011; Kaatz Unpublished; Khan 2004; Matchar
2010; Menendez-Jandula 2005; Rasmussen 2012; Ryan 2009;
Sidhu 2001; Siebenhofer 2007; Sunderji 2004; Verret 2012).
Secondary endpoints
Minor haemorrhage
Eighteen trials reported minor haemorrhage outcomes, with 13 re-
porting events (Azarnoush 2009; Cromheecke 2000; Fitzmaurice
2002; Fitzmaurice 2005; Gardiner 2005; Kaatz Unpublished;
Khan 2004; Matchar 2010; Menendez-Jandula 2005; Sawicki
1999; Sidhu 2001; Verret 2012; White 1989). Compared to stan-
dard therapy, self-monitoring or self-management there was no
difference in minor haemorrhage (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.41;
participants = 5365; studies = 13) (Analysis 4.1), but results varied
considerably(I2 =82%).The overall qualityof evidence wasdown-
graded from high to low because of serious risk of bias and substan-
tial heterogeneity (Summary of findings for the main comparison).
There was no reduction in minor haemorrhage with self-manage-
ment (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.76; participants = 1862; studies
= 7), or with self-monitoring (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.42; par-
ticipants = 3503; studies = 6) (Analysis 4.1). The quality of the evi-
dence for self-monitoring was downgraded from high to moderate
because of serious risk of bias (Summary of findings 2). The qual-
ity of evidence for self-management was downgraded from high to
low because of serious risk of bias and high heterogeneity (82%)
(Summary of findings 3). Onlyone trial (Menendez-Jandula2005)
showed a significant effect on minor haemorrhage with self-man-
agement (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.54).
Frequency of testing
Fourteen studies reported on the total number of tests performed
throughout the study (Fitzmaurice 2002; Gadisseur 2003 Self
mge; Gadisseur 2003 Self monit; Horstkotte 1998; Körtke 2001;
Menendez-Jandula 2005; Sidhu 2001; Siebenhofer 2007; Soliman
Hamad 2009; Sunderji 2004; Thompson 2013; Verret 2012;
Voller 2005; White 1989). Maximum test frequency occurred in
the study with the shortest duration (White 1989). The ratio of
tests in the self-monitoring or self-management groups compared
to the control groups ranged from 1.00 to 4.98; this ratio increased
with duration of study (test for linear trend P < 0.002). Due to
inadequate data, we were unable to rate the quality of the evidence.
Feasibility of testing
A population of 11,738 was sampled in 15 trials (Beyth
2000; Christensen 2006; Fitzmaurice 2002; Fitzmaurice 2005;
Gadisseur 2003 Self mge; Gadisseur 2003 Self monit; Gardiner
2005; Khan 2004; Kaatz Unpublished; Körtke 2001; Menendez-
Jandula 2005; Sawicki 1999; Sidhu 2001; Sunderji 2004;
Siebenhofer 2007). Of that population, 7974 were either excluded
or decided not to take part. The average proportion of people that
could not (or would not) take part in the trials was 68% (range
31% to 88%). In trials which included older populations (Beyth
2000; Fitzmaurice 2005), the exclusion rates were much higher.
Of the participants assigned to the intervention 24.9% (range 0%
to 57.3%) were unable to complete self-monitoring or self-man-
agement. The main reasons for the dropouts were: problems with
the device, physical limitations preventing self-testing and prob-
lems with attending the training assessments or failing the assess-
ment. Due to inadequate data, we were unable to rate the quality
of the evidence.

 Other outcomes
Thirteen studies evaluated quality of life outcomes. These in-
cluded ease of use (Gardiner 2005), anxiety caused by testing
(Kaatz Unpublished), beliefs specific to warfarin (Khan 2004), and
quality of life (Cromheecke 2000; Fitzmaurice 2002; Fitzmaurice
2005; Gadisseur 2003 Self mge; Gadisseur 2003 Self monit;
Grunau 2011; Khan 2004; Kaatz Unpublished; Matchar 2010;
Sawicki 1999; Soliman Hamad 2009; Verret 2012 ). Khan 2004
evaluated health status and quality of life using a validated tool,
the 36-item United Kingdom Short Form Health Survey (UKSF-
36) and the European Quality of Life questionnaire (Euroqol).
Fitzmaurice 2002 used the individual quality of life (SEIQoL) tool
for estimating quality of life and reported on results of participant
interviews (Fitzmaurice 2005). Grunau 2011 used a treatment-re-
lated satisfaction survey measuring five categories; Matchar 2010
used the Health Utilities Index Mark; Soliman Hamad 2009 used
the SF-36v2 questionnaire; and Verret 2012 used a validated ques-
tionnaire including 32 statements covering five socio-psycholog-
ical topics: general treatment satisfaction, self-efficacy, daily has-
sles, psychological distress, and strained social network. Four trials
(Cromheecke 2000; Gadisseur 2003 Selfmge; Gadisseur 2003 Self
monit; Sawicki 1999) used a questionnaire designed by Sawicki
on patients’ feelings towards anticoagulation therapy. Six studies
(Cromheecke 2000; Gadisseur 2003 Self mge; Gadisseur 2003
Self monit; Matchar 2010; Sawicki 1999; Verret 2012) showed
a significant difference in treatment satisfaction. In addition, one
study (Gadisseur 2004) (one of the articles from Gadisseur 2003
Self mge; Gadisseur 2003 Self monit) reported quality of life out-
comes showing greater treatment satisfaction in the self-monitor-
ing group compared to the self-management group. One study
(Matchar 2010), reported that there were no adverse events re-
sulting from physical interaction with the testing device. Due to
inadequate data, we were unable to rate the quality of the evidence
for quality of life and satisfaction.
Optimal information size
The calculated optimal information size needed for a reliable and
conclusive treatment effect was 5150 in each arm. This assumed
a 2% thromboembolic event rate in the control group, a 50% RR
reduction, a power of 95%, and a two-sided alpha = 0.01. The
current meta-analysis has approximately 4000 in each arm, which
would give a 78% power using the same assumptions.
One of the main trials included in the meta-analysis showed a
clear absence of correlation between the benefits observed and the
degree of control (Menendez-Jandula 2005). We therefore ques-
tioned the influence of this study by performing a post hoc sensi-
tivity analysis that removed the trial; the beneficial effects observed
for all the major outcomes remained similar.

Self-monitoring and self-management of oral anticoagulation (Review)
Copyright © 2016 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 D I S C U S S I O N
To our knowledge the present review is the most comprehensive re-
view to date. We identified 28 randomised controlled trials (RCTs)
trials (8950 participants). Self-monitoring or self-management of
oral anticoagulation leads to a significant 50% reduction in throm-
boembolism but no reduction in all-cause mortality. However, tri-
als of self-management led to a significant reduction in all-cause
mortality. Self-management did not reduce major haemorrhages
nor did self-monitoring.
Quality of the evidence
The GRADE approach was employed to interpret result findings
and the GRADE profiler (GRADEPRO) allowed us to import
data from Review Manager to create ’Summary of findings’ tables.
The overall quality of the evidence for the effect of self-monitoring
or self-management of oral anticoagulation on major haemorrhage
was moderate; the quality was downgraded because of serious risk
of bias across the studies. The quality of the evidence for trials of
self-management was downgraded from high to low because of
serious risk of bias and imprecision of effect estimate (i.e. large
confidence intervals). The quality of the evidence for trials of self-
monitoring was downgraded from high to low because of serious
risk of bias across the studies and strong suspicion of publication
bias.
The overall quality of the evidence for thromboembolic events was
moderate; downgraded because of serious risk of bias across the
included studies. The quality of the evidence for trials of either
self-monitoring or self-management were downgraded from high
to moderate because of serious risk of bias. The overall quality of
the evidence for mortality was moderate; downgraded because of
serious risk of bias across the included studies. The quality of the
evidence for trials of either self-monitoring or self-management
were downgraded from high to moderate because of serious risk
of bias.
The overall quality of the evidence for minor haemorrhage of the
evidence was low; downgraded because of serious risk of bias and
substantial heterogeneity in the meta-analysis result. The qual-
ity of the evidence for trials of self-management was downgraded
from high to low because of serious risk of bias and substantial
heterogeneity. The quality of the evidence for trials of self-moni-
toring was downgraded from high to moderate because of serious
risk of bias across the included studies. Due to inadequate data, we
were unable to rate the quality of the evidence for the following
outcomes: (i) Frequency of testing; (ii) Feasibility of testing; and
(iii) Quality of life and satisfaction.
Comparison with other reviews
This systematic review provides information additional to a sub-
stantial body of evidence from previously published reviews
of self-monitoring or self-management of oral anticoagulation
(Bazian 2005; Bloomfield 2011 Christensen 2007; Connock
2007; de Solà-Morales 2005; Heneghan 2006a; Ødegaard 2004;
Siebenhofer 2004) and a meta-analysis of individual patient data
(Heneghan 2012).
The main results of this review are consistent with previous re-
views. The Christensen 2007 review of 10 trials showed that
self-management was associated with a reduced risk of mortality
and major complications with increased time being spent within
the therapeutic INR target range. A 2004 review of eight trials
(Ødegaard 2004) identified a significant reduction in major clin-
ical events and a 2004 review of four trials (Siebenhofer 2004)
concluded that patient self-management is safe and can improve
the quality of anticoagulation control. A 2005 review of 12 trials
(seven RCTs and five quasi-experimental trials) (de Solà-Morales
2005), reported no difference between participants undertaking
self-management and those receiving usual care in the time spent
in the therapeutic range and in the incidence of adverse effects.
Bazian’s review (which was less comprehensive) also did not show
a difference between self-management and routine care (Bazian
2005). In the Bloomfield 2011 review, patients assigned to self-
monitoring or self-management had significantly lower total mor-
tality, lower risk for major thromboembolism, and no increased
risk in major haemorrhage.
An individual patient data meta-analysis (Heneghan 2012), which
included 11 trials with data for 6417 participants and 12,800 per-
son-years of follow-up, reported a significant reduction in throm-
boembolic events in the self-monitoring group (Hazard Ratio
(HR) 0.51; 95% CI 0.31 to 0.85), but not for major haemor-
rhagic events (HR 0.88, 95% CI, 0.74 to 1.06) or mortality (HR
0.82, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.09). In this review patients, younger than
55 years showed marked reductions in thrombotic events (HR
0.33, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.66), as did patients with mechanical heart
valve (HR 0.52, 95% CI, 0.35 to 0.77). The greater reduction in
mortality with self-management compared with self-monitoring
observed in this review might be related to the higher frequency
of thromboembolic events seen in the latter group. Also, reduced
mortality might be affected by increased patient empowerment,
whereby self-management influences other aspects of a patient’s
lifestyle (i.e. adherence to treatments) as they take on more of a
locus of control for their condition.
A 2015 Health Technology Assesment (HTA) systematic review
(Sharma 2015) on the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness
of point-of-care tests of people receiving long-term vitamin K an-
tagonist therapy reported that self-monitoring significantly pre-
vented thromboembolic events and reduced all-cause mortality in
people with artificial heart valves, and similarly to this current re-
view, reported greater reductions in thromboembolic events and
all-cause in those self-managing. In addition, the review reported
net UK health and social care costs, which over a 10-year period
were equivalent to standard monitoring costs.
Intrinsic limitations to self-monitoring and self-management in-

 clude the reluctance of individuals to participate in self-manage-
ment and the extensive training required to do so. Self-monitor-
ing is not feasible for up to half of the patients requiring antico-
agulation. Factors influencing patient participation within trials
included problems with the device; physical limitations; attending
training sessions; or failing the assessment. An additional prob-
lem with adoption in clinical practice will be the relatively high
cost of the test strips. The reliability of self-testing devices can af-
fect test results; however, available devices give INR results which
are comparable with those obtained in laboratory testing (Ansell
2005). Self-monitoring and self-management are also associated
with a rate of testing that is higher than with usual care. In effect
self-managed warfarin dosing is analogous to self-adjusted insulin
dosing according to a pre-specified sliding scale (Ansell 1996).
Such self-managed treatment has been practiced for years by peo-
ple with diabetes (Ansell 1996), and the use of self-monitoring or
self-management offers independence and freedom to travel for
selected patients.
Our review has some potential limitations. First, our search was
comprehensive, making serious publication bias less likely, but it
remains a concern. Therefore, the results may represent an over-
estimate of the true effect of treatment. Second, variability in the
quality of care in the control groups can affect the rate of test-
ing and hence the benefit and safety of standard anticoagulation
monitoring. Specialist programmes may improve outcomes by the
same mechanism as self-monitoring or self-management, that is
improving the time in therapeutic range and lessening the fre-
quency of adverse outcomes. However, our post hoc subgroup
analysis did not verify this effect. A further modifying factor is ed-
ucation and training. The two trials in which patients consented
to participate and received education alone had better results than
did those patients allocated to routine care (Gadisseur 2003 Self
mge; Gadisseur 2003 Self monit; Khan 2004). Third, for all the
major outcomes of this review, limitations in the published reports
led to an absence of information about the allocation conceal-
ment procedure or blinding. However, several authors were suc-
cessfully contacted and the additional information that they pro-
vided generally raised the assessed quality of the trials. This find-
ing is in agreement with recent empirical evidence suggesting that
authors fail to report concealment of randomisation and blinding
(Devereaux 2004). Finally, for all the major outcomes there was
a low numbers of events. Overestimates are likely in trials with
fewer than 500 events and large overestimates of the effects are
more likely in trials with fewer than 200 events. (Bassler 2010)
Self-monitoring or self-management are likely to prevent throm-
boembolism to a greater extent than standard monitoring. The
mechanism of effect is probably through increasing the number
of INR values in range and therefore the longer time that pa-
tients are in the therapeutic range. Despite the limitations outlined
above the apparent beneficial effects are large, and even smaller
true underlying effects would probably justify widespread use of
self-monitoring and self-management of oral anticoagulation in
suitable candidates.

Implications for practice
Self-monitoring or self-management by patients can improve the
qualityof oral anticoagulationtherapycompared tostandardmon-
itoring. Patients spend more time within the therapeutic range
resulting in decreases in thromboembolic events with no increase
in harms. Self-monitoring or self-management is potentially not
feasible for half of the patients requiring anticoagulation. In addi-
tion, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)
guidance in the UK (NICE diagnostics guidance [DG14]) for
atrial fibrillation and heart valve disease currently recommends
both the CoaguChek XS and InRatio2 PT/INR meters for pa-
tients if they are able and suitably trained. NICE also recom-
mends not routinely offering self-monitoring to patients who have
had a deep vein thrombosis or a pulmonary embolism (NICE
Venous thromboembolic diseases (CG144). The British Commit-
tee for Standards in Haematology guidance (Jennings 2014) high-
lights the need for motivated patients to demonstrate competency
and to be trained. Patients should also be reviewed at least ev-
ery six months with documentation of their results and dosing,
with external quality assessment to be undertaken at least every
six months. The guidance also recommends that an INR > 8·0
(if confirmed on a repeat sample) requires a venous sample to be
analysed in a hospital laboratory and that medical advice is sought.
Implications for research
For the results to be generalisable to the population at large, there
is a need for population-based studies that collect data on adverse
event rates, time in range, and factors that impinge on successful
self-monitoring and self-management (Nagler 2014). The nature
of this intervention lends itself to a registry to guarantee its safety
and effectiveness in clinical practice. Future studies should set out
to understand why people decide to use self-management (or not)
and should incorporate consumer knowledge about self-manage-
ment, triggers to seek care, self-efficacy or self-confidence to self-
manage, and perceived or actual support. Further studies should
explore components of the intervention that affect the feasibility
of self-monitoring and self-management and identify means to
improve uptake and effectiveness. In addition, given the low rates
of adverse events in trials of self-monitoring, studies comparing
its use to newer oral anticoagulants, which do not require moni-
toring, are warranted.

Methods
Single-centre, randomised, parallel-group controlled trial.
Participants
206 adult patients who had undergone valve replacement with a mechanical prosthesis,
with or without myocardial revascularisation
Interventions
Self-monitoring vs standard monitoring
Randomised to standard monitoring of INR at a laboratory including at least one
monthly assay at a medical analysis laboratory (n = 103), or self-testing using either
the CoaguChek® system (n = 55) or the INRatio® system (n = 48). Self-testing was
performed weekly, and in addition once monthly INR measurements were carried out at
the laboratory on the same day as the self-measurement. Only the results of the monthly
tests for each group were compared. Education relating to VKA therapy was provided,
the same to all participants in all allocation groups. The target INR and target range
were determined for each participant on the basis of the type of surgery, and according
to their risk factors for thromboembolic disease (target ranges were between 2 and 3.5
INR). Aspirin was prescribed to some participants according to risk factors

 Christensen 2006
Methods
Single centre, open-label, randomised controlled trial
Participants
100 ambulatory patients aged > 18 years (mean age 63 years in intervention group, 69
years in control group) receiving oral anticoagulation therapy for > 8 months. The study
was based in the Center of Self-managed Oral Anticoagulation (Denmark)
Exclusion criteria included: previous self-management.
Interventions
Self-management vs usual care
Randomisation to a) self-management (n = 50), in which participants were trained to
self-monitor using a Coaguchek® coagulometer to measure INR once a week and also
to adjust their anticoagulant dosage accordingly
b) usual care (n = 50), in which conventional management included at least monthly
INR testing at a hospital or physician centre and dosage adjusted by the physician
In both groups an additional INR analysis was performed monthly and the participant
contacted if INR was < 1.5 or > 4.5
After 6 months intervention, the control group began training to self-manage their
anticoagulation therapy
Outcomes
Primary outcome: composite of the variance of the monthly INR test plus negative score
points for death, major complications, or study discontinuation
Secondary outcomes: variance of INR values in the control sample; time within thera-
peutic INR range
Trial identification
Study duration
6 months
Oral anticoagulant used
Warfarin or phenprocoumon.
Notes
Training took place over 6 months, during which time the participant gradually assumed
self-management of oral anticoagulation monitoring and dosing. Assessment of ability
to self-manage was made at the end of 6 months

Methods
Single centre, randomised, controlled cross-over trial.
Participants
Participants were 50 consecutive outpatients who were receiving long-term anticoagu-
lation (mean age 42 years). The study was based in the departments of cardiology and
internal medicine of the Academic Medical Centre (Amsterdam, The Netherlands)
Interventions
Self-management vs usual care
The intervention group used home self-testing using Coaguchek® to self-monitor pro-
thrombin time and self-dosing testing performed once a week
The conventional management was done by the anticoagulation clinic
INR testing was also performed in all participants at 1-2 week intervals by the central
laboratory; these results were not made available to participants or managing physicians
After three months patients crossed over the alternative management strategy
Outcomes
Primary outcome: no. of INR measurements within 0.5 of therapeutic target INR

Methods
Multicentre, randomised, controlled trial
Participants
Patients at least 18 years of age who were receiving warfarin for at least 3 months for
either atrial fibrillation or for one or more mechanical heart valves. Patients needed to
have a stable INR within the therapeutic range for the 2 weeks before enrolment, without
maintenance dose adjustments above 2 mg per day, so that an individual algorithm could
be developed.The study was conducted at Liverpool, Royal Prince Alfred, and Strathfield
Private Hospitals, all in Australia
Interventions
The intervention group was trained to perform home INR testing and warfarin dosing
using a validated ColourChart algorithm. Patients checked their INR at least once a
week, and more frequently if required by the algorithm
Patients were instructed to call the study nurse to discuss maintenance dose adjustment
if the INR was less than 1.6, greater than 4.5, or out-of-range for more than 4 tests
The usual-care group was also given instructions on how to complete a black-and-white
chart similar to the ColourChart to record their clinical INR test results but without the
algorithm instructions
For 12 months, all patients had monthly outcome INRs measured at a central accredited
laboratory
Outcomes
Primary outcome was the proportion of out-of-range INRs.
Secondary endpoints included: 1. the number of times outcome INR results occurred in
extreme ranges (≥ 4.5, < 1.5); and 2. rates of serious adverse events related to bleeding
or thrombosis. Subsidiary (tertiary) endpoints were: 1. the average deviation from the
middle of each individual’s INR target range; 2. the mean outcome INR, by treatment
group allocation; and 3. time to the first INR reading in an extreme range
Serious adverse events were classified as embolism, thrombosis, moderate bleeding (re-
quiring medical evaluation or treatment, minor and nuisance bleeding excluded), severe,
life-threatening, or fatal bleeding, and other events, and were adjudicated by a blinded
assessor as to nature and cause

Participants were individuals receiving ongoing warfarin therapy for > 2 months and

Interventions
Self-monitoring vs usual care
Participants were randomised to supervised self-testing or to usual care (conventional
clinic management) for 6 months; subsequently the allocation was reversed for a further
6 months
In the self-testing group, participants initially self-tested INR twice weekly. Once the
INRwastherapeuticfor2-3consecutive readings, the interval betweentests was increased
to a maximum of every 2 weeks. Participants accessed a web-based system to enter signs
and symptoms and INR and receive instant automated guidance on dose and testing;
if INR deviation was serious the participant was asked to take a bolus dose of warfarin
(< 1.5) or hold their warfarin (> 5.0) and/or to log in later the same day for additional
instructions. If a participant reported a symptom suggestive of a bleed or an embolus
they were told to seek immediate medical advice.
The research pharmacist accessed the caregiver interface of the program at least once
daily to review participant problems. Any participant who failed to test their INR or log
in to the program as scheduled was contacted by telephone the same day. All new dosage
recommendations were reviewed and adjusted if necessary. All extreme INRs (<1.5 or

 Verret 2012
Methods
Randomised, controlled, open-label trial
Participants
Participants were adults aged 18-75 years receiving long term warfarin at a specialised
anticoagulation clinic (n = 114)
Interventions
Self-management vs usual care
Randomised to pharmacist-led warfarin patient self-management program (n = 58) or
conventional anticoagulation clinic care
All participants attended an educational session on anticoagulation provided by a phar-
macist
Participants randomised to the self-management group also received training to use the
CoaguChek XS device and a self-management dosing algorithm
Participants monitored their INR weekly and adjusted their dose of warfarin according
to a written algorithm. Participants recorded their INR results and dose adjustments on
a voicemail, reviewed by pharmacists. The participant was contacted by a pharmacist if
a contact was missed. If an INR fell outside the algorithm limits (1.5 or 4.5 for a target
INR of 2.0-3.0, or 2.2 or 5.0 for a target INR of 2.5-3.5), the dose was adjusted by the
pharmacist. Each week participants completed a pre-INR questionnaire to identify and
inform the pharmacist of new factors that could affect their INR e.g. the addition of
prescription or non-prescription drugs, changes in diet. Participants in the self-manage-
ment group kept a record of their INR, daily doses of warfarin, and adverse events
Participants in the control group (n = 56) received standard anticoagulation clinic care
All participants attended clinic at 4 months to check INR and complete quality of life
questionnaires
Outcomes
Primary outcome: anticoagulation-related quality of life.

Feedback: Revisiting the ’unbelievable’ protective effects of Patient Self-Management with POC Anticoagulation?
Dear Authors,
You conclude that the Point of Care approach (POC) associated with Patient Self Management (PSM) reduces all-cause mortality by
45% (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.84) over a follow-up period of 2 years, in comparison to patients with a laboratory-based monitoring
of coagulation parameters.
However, we believe that such statement is not supported by available evidence.
To date, fourteen studies on POC+PSM reported all-cause mortality as an outcome. However, the results are estimable in only 7 of
them. On the basis of these 7 studies, the all cause mortality rate would decrease by 45% (95%CI: 16%-64%) for patients using
POC+PSM (Figure 9 of your review). Similar results were reported by other authors [1]. As displayed in the forest plot (figure 9 of your

 review), one specific study is very influential in the analysis of POC+PSM, the one by Koertke et al. [2], which is the long-term follow-
up of another study by the same authors [3]. That study bears a 59.0% weight in the meta-analysis POC+PSM. Thus the quality of
that study determines the strength or the weakness of the analysis. Strikingly, that study presents a number of important flaws:
1. The randomization procedure is unclear and allocation concealment is not described.
2. Only 930 patients over the 1,155 patients (80.5%) in the initial trial 4 participated in the follow- up study (442 in the control
group and 488 in the PSM group). How the patient selection was done is not described. We don’t know how much the 930 follow-
up patients differed from the 1,155 patients of the initial study. There are indirect clues of selection bias. In the 2001 paper, no
differences at baseline between groups were reported (although the results were not displayed). In contradiction, in the follow-up study,
important and clinically relevant differences between groups at baseline were obvious (table 1 in [2)]. Patients in the control group
were significantly in
worse health condition at baseline than PSM patients: 5.9% were in NYHA functional class vs. 2.0% of PSM
patients (p=0.04), and 10.2 % had undergone a double valve replacement vs. 5.3% of the PSM patients (p=0.01). Authors of the paper
acknowledged that a double valve replacement bears a higher mortality risk. Age difference between groups at baseline is not reported
in the paper, although being also a determinant of lethality. As the patient selection is not described in the follow-up study, we cannot
conclude if such differences were due to selection bias or differential lost to follow-up, but this question is of secondary interest.
3. The authors reported 236 deaths over the follow-up period (94 in PSM patients, 142 in controls). However, when these numbers
are subtracted from the initial numbers of participants, 300 and 394 participants should remain at months 120 in the control and
PSM group, respectively. In figure 2 of the paper by Koertke et al. [2], these numbers are 260 and 305. So, 40 were lost to follow-
up in the control group and 89 in the PSM group. Such difference could explain some or most of the mortality difference between
groups. However, the authors did not discuss the fact nor provide a description of these lost to follow-ups, in particular if they presented
differential characteristics between groups. Authors laconically reported that “122 patients were either noncompliant within the first
two years of the study or switched over from INR self-management to INR measurement by a GP and vice-versa during follow-up
(p27 in [2]).
On the basis of these elements, the study can be rated low quality. Christensen et al. also categorized the study by Koertke et al. in ?
lower quality trials? [1]. We argue that when a study presents such potential flaws and bears a dominant weight in the meta-analysis,
a sensitivity analysis should be performed for a more realistic appraisal of evidence, and results of such sensitivity analysis should be
fully discussed. Not surprisingly in this case, when the study by Koerkte et al. is removed from the meta-analysis, there is no more
statistically significant evidence that POC+PSM confers an improved survival to patients (RR=0.72; 95%CI: 0.42-1.24). Christensen
et al. also reached a non significant RR=0.49 (95%CI: 0.21-1.14) when analysing only high quality trials [1].
Also noteworthy, Koerkte et al. reported 4 baseline factors associated to an excess mortality in their study: age; being a control; atrial
fibrillation; and other than aortic surgery. When adjusting for these factors in a multivariate analysis, the “protective effect” of PSM fell
to 23% (95%: 0%-42%), a much lower value than the one used in previous meta-analyzes [1, 4, 5].
I would appreciate receiving your thoughts on my comments.

In response to comments by Dominique Roberfroid submitted 2nd April 2012:
Dear Dominique,
In terms of mortality we report a reduction in all-cause mortality of 36% (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.89) and as stated for self-
management of 45% (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.84) over a follow-up period of 2 years.[1]
It is correct that the study by Koertke et al [2] provides a substantial amount of data to the mortality analysis for self-management. In
terms of the GRADE of the paper we therefore judged the evidence to be of moderate quality around the reported effects, particularly
due to an absence of information on allocation concealment and also because there was a few number of events. However, in terms of
study quality we confirmed in a subsequent publication, [3] and with direct communication with the authors for this Cochrane review
that randomization and allocation concealment were clear in this study.
In terms of the baseline difference in this trial these imbalances could have led to differences in the outcomes. We stated in the discussion
that the 36% reduction in mortality from all causes was largely influenced by one study. In addition we applied the logic of early
stopping of randomized controlled trials to determine whether our meta-analysis could be considered definitive. It is not, the calculated
optimal information size needed to reliably detect a plausible treatment effect is 2,300 patients per group for thromboembolic events
alone.
Further to the publication of this review a large RCT was published in the US.[4] We have analysed this in our subsequent publication
‘Self-monitoring of oral anticoagulation: systematic review and meta-analysis of individual patient data’ [3] including individual patient
data from 11 trials of 6,417 participants including the Koertke data.
This allowed us to verify the trial methods as well as undertake time-to-event outcomes analysed with hazard ratios (HR) with 5 years
of follow-up data, which take into account the number of people randomized and timing of events, and the time until last follow-up
for each patient not experiencing an event. In this study [3] we reported a significant reduction in thromboembolic events in the self-
monitoring group (HR 0.51; 95% CI 0.31 to 0.85) but a non-significant reduction in death for the self-monitoring group (HR 0·82,
95% CI 0.62 to 1.09) and a non-significant effect in terms of death for the self-management group alone (HR 0.75, 95% CI, to 0.42
to 1.33).
Therefore, the protective effect is lower than previously estimated in our previous review.[1] Reasons for this could include lower quality
trial methodology but could also results as improvements in the control group care occur over time. The increase in the number of
trials and participants allows us to improve the confidence around our estimated and we will incorporate this additional data into our
updated review.

The search was updated in July 2015. Ten new trials were
found for inclusion
1 June 2016
New citation required and conclusions have changed
The original review reported a reduction in mortality with
self-management or self-monitoring; in this update, with the
addition of the 10 new trials (adding 4227 participants) this
risk reduction was no longer statistically significant; however,
after the removal of low-quality studies, the original finding
of a reduction in all-cause mortality was found
Secondly, the original review found that trials of self-monitor-
ing alone did not result in a statistically significant reduction
in thromboembolic events; the new finding is a statistically
significant reduction
Thirdly, in the original review, self-monitoring significantly
reduced major haemorrhage; in this update, self-monitoring
did not reduce major haemorrhage, but removal of studies
with low quality resulted in a statistically significant reduction

Changes were introduced between protocol and review stage to increase the scope and quality of the review. The title changed from “Self
management for oral anticoagulation” to “Self-monitoring and self-management of oral anticoagulation”. The authors’ list changed
from Garcia-Alamino JM, Martin JLR, Subirana M, Gich I to Garcia-Alamino JM, Ward AM, Alonso-Coello P
, Perera R, Bankhead
C, Fitzmaurice D, Heneghan C. The type of studies changed from “Randomised controlled trials assessing the therapeutic efficacy and
safety of self-management” to “Randomised controlled trials assessing the therapeutic effectiveness and safety of self-monitoring or self-
management of oral anticoagulation”. In the ’Types of outcome measures’ mortality was added as an outcome. The quality assessment
of the studies in the review now includes assessment of the evidence with the GRADE system.
