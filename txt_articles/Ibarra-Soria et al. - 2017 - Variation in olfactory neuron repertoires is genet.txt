Abstract The mouse olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) repertoire is composed of 10 million cells
and each expresses one olfactory receptor (OR) gene from a pool of over 1000. Thus, the nose is
sub-stratified into more than a thousand OSN subtypes. Here, we employ and validate an RNA-
sequencing-based method to quantify the abundance of all OSN subtypes in parallel, and
investigate the genetic and environmental factors that contribute to neuronal diversity. We find
that the OSN subtype distribution is stereotyped in genetically identical mice, but varies
extensively between different strains. Further, we identify cis-acting genetic variation as the
greatest component influencing OSN composition and demonstrate independence from OR
function. However, we show that olfactory stimulation with particular odorants results in
modulation of dozens of OSN subtypes in a subtle but reproducible, specific and time-dependent
manner. Together, these mechanisms generate a highly individualized olfactory sensory system by
promoting neuronal diversity.

Introduction
Mapping the neuronal diversity within a brain remains a fundamental challenge of neuroscience.
Quantifying variance in a population of neurons within and between individuals first requires precise
discrimination of cellular subtypes, followed by an accurate method of counting them. While this has
been achieved in a simple invertebrate model containing hundreds of neurons (White et al., 1986),
applying the same approach to mammalian brains that encompass many millions of neurons repre-
sents a significant challenge (Wichterle et al., 2013).
The main olfactory epithelium (MOE) is an essential component of the olfactory sensory system. It
contains olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) that express olfactory receptors (ORs), the proteins that
bind odorants (Buck and Axel, 1991; Zhao et al., 1998). The mouse genome codes for over a thou-
sand functional OR genes, but each mature OSN expresses only one abundantly, in a monoallelic
fashion (Hanchate et al., 2015; Saraiva et al., 2016; Tan et al., 2015; Chess et al., 1994). This
results in a highly heterogeneous repertoire of approximately 10 million OSNs (Kawagishi et al.,

 2014) within the nose of a mouse, stratified into more than a thousand functionally distinct subpopu-
lations, each one characterized by the particular OR it expresses. The monogenic nature of OR
expression serves as a molecular barcode for OSN subtype identity. Thus, the MOE offers a unique
opportunity to generate a comprehensive neuronal map of a complex mammalian sensory organ,
and investigate the mechanisms that influence its composition and maintenance.
To date only a few studies have quantified the number of OSNs that express a given OR
(Bressel et al., 2016; Fuss et al., 2007; Khan et al., 2011; Rodriguez-Gil et al., 2010; Royal and
Key, 1999; Young et al., 2003). For the scarce data available (<10% of the full repertoire) reproduc-
ible differences in abundance have been observed between OSNs expressing different ORs
(Bressel et al., 2016; Fuss et al., 2007; Khan et al., 2011; Young et al., 2003). This suggests vari-
ance in the representation of OSN subtypes exists within an individual, but the extent of variation
between individuals is unknown. Moreover, the mechanisms that dictate the abundance of OSN sub-
types are poorly understood. Most promoters of OR genes contain binding sites for Olf1/Ebf1 (O/E)
and homeodomain (HD) transcription factors (Young et al., 2011), and these are involved in deter-
mining the probability with which the OR genes are chosen for expression (Rothman et al., 2005;
Vassalli et al., 2011). Enhancer elements also regulate the gene choice frequencies of nearby, but
not distally located, ORs (Khan et al., 2011). To date, these studies have focused only on a handful
of OSN subtypes.
In addition to OR gene choice regulation exerted by genetic elements, it is conceivable that the
olfactory system adapts to the environment. The MOE is continually replacing its OSN pool and the
birth of every neuron presents an opportunity to shape the proportion of different subpopulations.
It is also possible that relative OSN abundances could be altered by regulating the lifespan of each
OSN subtype. Indeed activation extends a sensory neuron’s life-span (Santoro and Dulac, 2012),
suggesting that persistent exposure to particular odorants may, over time, increase the relative pro-
portions of the OSNs responsive to them. Some OSN subtypes do reportedly increase in number in
response to odor activation, but others do not (Cadiou et al., 2014; Cavallin et al., 2010;
eLife digest Smells are simply chemicals in the air that are recognized by nerves in our nose.
Each nerve has a receptor that can identify a limited number of chemicals, and the nerve then relays
this information to the brain. Animals have hundreds to thousands of different types of these nerves
meaning that they can detect a wide array of smells.
Smell receptors are proteins, and the genes that encode these proteins can be very different in
two unrelated people. This could partly explain, for example, why some people find certain odors
intense and unpleasant while others do not. However, having different genes for smell receptors
does not by itself completely explain why some people are more sensitive than others to particular
smells. The amounts of each nerve type in the nose might also differ between people and have an
effect, but to date it has not been possible to accurately count them all.
Ibarra-Soria et al. have now devised a new method to essentially count the number of each nerve
type in the noses of mice from different breeds. The method makes use of a technique called RNA-
sequencing, which can reveal which genes are active at any one time, and thus show how many
nerves are producing each type of smell receptor. Ibarra-Soria et al. learned that different breeds of
mice had remarkably different compositions of nerves in their noses. Further analysis revealed that
this was due to changes to the DNA code near to the genes that encode the smell receptor.
Next, Ibarra-Soria et al. sought to find out how the amount of each nerve type is controlled by
giving mice water with different smells for weeks and looking how this affected their noses. These
experiments revealed that a small number of the nerve types became more or less common after
exposure to a smell. The altered nerves were directly involved in recognizing the smells, proving
that the very act of smelling can change the make-up of nerves in a mouse’s nose.
These results confirm that the diversity in the nose of each individual is not only dictated by the
types of receptors found in there, but also by the number of each nerve type. The next challenge is
to understand better how these differences change the way people perceive smells.

 Watt et al., 2004). Whether this variation reflects differences in the biology of OSN subtypes or
experimental procedures is unclear.
Here, we fully map OSN diversity in the MOE and characterize the influence of both genetic and
environmental factors on its regulation. We show that RNA sequencing (RNAseq) is an accurate
proxy for measuring the number of OSNs expressing a particular OR type, and use this approach to
quantify, in parallel, the composition of 1115 OSN subtypes in the MOE. We report that, while the
repertoire of OSN subtypes is stable across individuals from the same strain, it reproducibly and
extensively differs between genetically divergent strains of laboratory mice. We show that under
controlled environmental conditions, these stereotypic differences in OSN abundance are directed
by genetic variation within regulatory elements of OR genes that predominantly act in cis and are
independent of the function of the OR protein. However, we find that persistent, but not continuous,
exposure to specific odorants can also subtly alter abundance of the OSN subtypes that are respon-
sive to such stimuli. Taken together, these results show that the OSN repertoire is shaped by both
genetic and environmental influences to generate a unique nose for each individual.
Results
Olfactory sensory neuron diversity measured by RNAseq
Previously, we characterized the transcriptional profile of the whole olfactory mucosa (WOM) in adult
C57BL/6J animals (hereafter termed B6) to generate hundreds of new, extended OR gene annota-
tions (Ibarra-Soria et al., 2014). As each OR gene is expressed in only a small fraction of cells within
WOM, differences in their abundance are difficult to distinguish from sampling bias. We hypothe-
sized that mapping RNAseq data to significantly extended OR transcripts should increase detection
sensitivity. With these models, OR gene mRNA level estimates in adult WOM increase, on average,
2.3-fold, but some increase almost 20-fold (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A). Despite this improve-
ment, most OR mRNAs still have relatively low-expression values (Figure 1A). Nevertheless, they
show a dynamic range of abundance levels (Figure 1A, inset) that are consistent between biological
replicates, as indicated by their very high correlation values (median rho = 0.89, p<2.2 � 10�16).
To assess whether these low OR mRNA expression values are biologically meaningful or if they
represent low-level technical artifacts of RNAseq analysis, we sequenced RNA from WOM of a
mouse strain that has a targeted homozygous deletion of the Olfr7 OR gene cluster on chromosome
9 (Xie et al., 2000; Khan et al., 2011), and compared their gene expression profile to control mice.
From the 94 OR genes of the cluster that have been deleted, 83 (88.3%) have no counts in any of
the three biological replicates. The 11 remaining genes have just one or two fragments mapped in
only one of the replicates (Figure 1B), resulting in normalized counts of less than 0.4. In contrast, the
control mice have from 14.2 to 498.1 normalized counts for the same genes. Together these experi-
ments demonstrate that the use of extended gene models significantly increases the sensitivity to
detect OR mRNA expression in WOM, and that the full dynamic range of abundances reflects true
measures of OR gene expression.
The wide range of stereotypic OR gene expression can be explained by two scenarios, acting
alone or in combination (Figure 1C): either (1) OR genes with high-expression values are monogen-
ically expressed in more OSNs than those with low-expression values; and/or (2) OR genes are con-
sistently expressed at different levels per OSN. To differentiate between these possibilities, we
performed in situ hybridization (ISH) of probes specific to nine OR genes with expression values dis-
tributed across the dynamic range. We then counted the number of OSNs in which each OR is
expressed (Figure 1D). We find very strong correlation between OSN number and RNAseq expres-
sion value (rho = 0.98, p=5 � 10�5). We additionally compared OR gene RNAseq expression levels
with three independent measures of the number of OSNs expressing the same ORs (Bressel et al.,
2016; Fuss et al., 2007; Khan et al., 2011). In all three cases, we find high correlations (Figure 1—
figure supplement 1B–D). We next collected 63 single mature OSNs from WOM, and determined

OSNs that express each receptor (Figure 1C), the probability of isolating each OSN type is not
equal. Indeed, we find a strong selection bias towards OSNs that express OR genes with high RNA-
seq levels in WOM (hypergeometric test, p=6.44 � 10�9; Figure 1E), suggesting those OSN types

 are more numerous in the olfactory epithelium. Thus, consistent with a recent analysis in zebra fish
(Saraiva et al., 2015), OR RNAseq values are an accurate measure of the number of each OSN sub-
type in the mouse WOM (scenario 1). But do consistent differences in OR mRNA levels per cell also
contribute (scenario 2)? To test this, we quantified the mRNA levels of the most abundant OR gene
in each of the 63 single, mature OSNs, normalized to three stably expressed OSN marker genes
(Khan et al., 2013). We find OR mRNA levels vary within the single cells, but this does not correlate
with expression levels across the WOM (rho = �0.04, p=0.7518) (Figure 1F). Analysis of ERCC
spike-ins confirmed that the levels of OR mRNAs in single OSNs are reliable. Moreover, the single
OSN transcript levels also positively correlate with transcript levels in pools of millions of OSNs
(Saraiva et al., 2016). Together, these data demonstrate that OR mRNA levels obtained by RNAseq
are an accurate proxy for quantifying the diversity of OSN subtypes that express each receptor.
The OSN repertoire differs between strains of mouse
The relative proportion of each OSN subtype is stable between genetically identical animals. We
have previously reported the expression of OR genes in B6 male and female mice (Ibarra-
Soria et al., 2014). By applying full gene models to these data, here we confirm their OSN distribu-
tion profiles are remarkably similar (Figure 2A); only 1.2% of the OR gene repertoire is significantly
differentially expressed (Figure 2B). To investigate whether this OSN distribution is a stereotypic
feature of the species, we next reconstructed the WOM transcriptome of a different laboratory
strain, 129S5SvEv (hereafter termed 129). The 129 genome has 4.4 million single nucleotide poly-
morphisms (SNPs) and 0.81 million small indels compared to B6 (Keane et al., 2011), of which we
find 13,484 SNPs and 1,936 indels within our extended OR gene transcripts. As OR genes are partic-
ularly variable in coding sequence between strains of mice (Logan, 2014), mapping RNAseq data
from other strains to a B6 reference genome results in biases in OR gene expression estimates (Fig-
ure 2—figure supplement 1A). We therefore generated a pseudo-129 genome on which to map
the RNAseq data, by editing the reference genome at all polymorphic sites. We confirmed that the
RNAseq expression estimates correlate with the number of OSNs that express the corresponding
receptor genes in 129 animals, as judged by in situ hybridization (rho = 1, p=5.5 � 10�6; Figure 2—
figure supplement 1B). From the 1,249 OR genes, we find 462 are significantly differentially
expressed (DE) compared to B6 (false discovery rate (FDR) < 5%), representing 37% of the whole
repertoire (Figure 2C,D).
To determine whether greater genetic diversity influences the variance in OSN repertoire, we
repeated this experiment using a wild-derived strain from the Mus musculus castaneus subspecies
(CAST/EiJ, henceforth CAST). This strain has more than 17.6 million SNPs and 2.7 million indels rela-
tive to B6 (Keane et al., 2011); of these, we counted that 45,688 SNPs and 6,303 indels are found
within our extended OR transcripts. After mapping to a pseudo-CAST genome (Figure 2—figure
supplement 1C), 634 OR genes are significantly differentially expressed (FDR < 5%) compared to
B6, constituting 50.8% of the whole OR repertoire (Figure 2E,F). The changes in expression for

levels for different OR genes can be explained by two scenarios: (left) an OR gene with high RNAseq levels is expressed by a larger number of OSNs
than a gene with low RNAseq abundance; and/or (right) an OR with high RNAseq values is expressed in the same number of OSNs as one with low
RNAseq values, but at higher levels per OSN. (D) Comparison of the number of OSNs that express nine OR genes assessed by in situ hybridization

samples is plotted (left), alongside the equivalent values for the ORs that were present in the picked single-OSNs (right). There is a significant

expression value for the highest OR detected in each of the 63 single-OSNs (y-axis) to the corresponding mean value in WOM (x-axis, n = 3). The line is

 some OR genes are dramatic: 132 genes have differences of at least eight fold. Taking all pairwise
comparisons into account (including 129 vs CAST, Figure 2—figure supplement 1D,E), 821 OR
genes (65.7%) are DE between at least two strains. One hundred and thirty-six of these are DE in all
three pairwise comparisons (Figure 2G); for example, there are consistently different numbers of
Olfr6-expressing OSNs in each strain (Figure 2H).
To determine if the DE OR genes between strains reflect differences in the proportions of OSN
subtypes, we performed ISH with probes specific to OR genes with significantly different expression
values between B6 and 129 (Figure 2I). We then counted the number of OSNs that express nine dif-
ferent OR mRNAs, in each strain, and compared this with their RNAseq expression values
(Figure 2J). We find a high correlation between the difference in OSN number and the difference in
RNAseq expression values between B6 and 129 (rho = 0.98, p=5 � 10�5; Figure 2K), demonstrating
our RNAseq-based approach accurately measures the difference in OSN repertoires between
strains.
OR gene clusters are enriched in copy number variants (CNVs) between individual human
(Nozawa et al., 2007; Young et al., 2008) and mouse strain genomes (Graubert et al., 2007).
Thus, it is possible that variance in OSN subtype representations are a consequence of different
numbers of highly similar OR genes between strains. To assess this, we mined CAST genome
sequence data (Keane et al., 2011) for heterozygous SNPs within annotated OR genes. We identi-
fied 51 ORs that contain 10 or more heterozygous SNPs, an indication of additional alleles. Using
genome sequencing data from these genes, we identified 30 novel or misassembled OR genes. We
remapped the CAST RNAseq data to a pseudo-CAST genome incorporating these new OR alleles
and re-estimated the expression of the OR repertoire. The overall abundance profile remains
unchanged except for 36 genes (Figure 2—figure supplement 1F). To assess whether this accounts
for the observed differential expression between strains, we compared these estimates to B6. Only
12 of 634 OR genes lose their DE status, and 4 OR genes now become DE (Figure 2—figure sup-
plement 1G). Thus, while differences in OR gene copy number minimally contribute to the diversity
in OSN repertoire between three strains of mice, other mechanisms are responsible for most of the
variation.

 each strain of mouse, when housed in homogeneous groups, is exposed to a unique pre- and post-
natal olfactory environment. As odor exposure alters the life-span of OSNs in an activity-dependent
manner (Franc
¸ois et al., 2013; Santoro and Dulac, 2012; Watt et al., 2004), genetic variation could
regulate OSN population dynamics either directly or indirectly, via odortype. We, therefore, devised
an experiment to test and differentiate the influence of the olfactory environment from the genetic
background.
We transferred four to eight-cell stage B6 and 129 zygotes to F1 mothers to ensure they experi-
enced an identical in utero environment. At birth, B6 litters were cross-fostered to B6 mothers and
129 litters to 129 mothers. In addition, B6 litters received a single 129 pup, and 129 litters a single
B6 pup. Therefore, each litter experienced a characteristic olfactory environment, but one animal
(the alien) had a different genetic background from the others (Figure 3A). At 10 weeks of age, we
quantified the OSN repertoires of six alien animals and six cage-mates using RNAseq. We found
that the OSN repertoires cluster in two groups, clearly defined by genetic background (Figure 3B).
The correlation coefficient for any two B6 samples was on average 0.97, with no significant differ-
ence between the environments (t-test, p=0.09). In contrast, the correlation for any B6 with a 129
sample had a mean of 0.89, which is significantly lower (t-test, p=3.8 � 10�12). Five hundred and
seven OR genes, among 5475 other genes are DE between these mice when grouped by strain (Fig-
ure 3—figure supplement 1A). In striking contrast, across the whole transcriptome we find only
mRNA from two genes that show differences in expression according to odor environment, both of
which encode ORs (Figure 3C, Figure 3—figure supplement 1B). These data demonstrate that the
diversity in OSN repertoire we observe between strains is almost entirely dictated by direct genetic
effects. In a controlled environment, the influence of odortype on the development and maintenance
of the MOE is minimal, perhaps restricted to only a few OSN subtypes.
OSN diversity profiles are independent of OR function and are
controlled in cis
The indifference of the OSN repertoire to the olfactory environment suggests its development and
maintenance is not influenced by the specific activity of OR proteins or, by inference, their protein
coding sequence. To further test this, we analyzed the OSN repertoire of newborn pups. We identify
the presence of 1,198 (95.9%) OSN subtypes across a dynamic range of abundance (Figure 4A). The
differential proportions of OSNs expressing particular OR genes are therefore already present dur-
ing the development of the MOE, suggesting that it is not dependent on the activity of the OSNs
nor on differences in OSN life-span.
Next, we analyzed the expression of ORs that are pseudogenized and do not produce receptor
proteins capable of odor-mediated activity, but can be co-expressed with functional ORs
(Serizawa et al., 2003; Saraiva et al., 2016). These are represented in OSNs with a very similar dis-
tribution to functional OR genes (Figure 4B). Moreover, we analyzed the OR genes that encode
identical protein-coding sequences between different strains. 36.3% of the OSN subtypes that
express identical ORs are differentially represented between 129 and B6. 44.8% are differentially
represented between CAST and B6. Together, these results suggest that the proportion of each
OSN subtype is not dependent on its endogenous OR receptor activity.
To directly test whether the abundance of a particular OSN subtype is influenced by the identity
of the receptor protein it expresses, we used CRISPR-Cas9 to replace only the coding sequence of
Olfr1507 with that of Olfr2 (referred to as Olfr2 > Olfr1507), in a pure B6 genetic background
(Figure 4C). OSNs expressing Olfr1507 are the most common subtype in B6, while Olfr2 expressing
OSNs are ranked 334th by decreasing abundance. Homozygous Olfr2 > Olfr1507 animals have 47
fold more Olfr2-expressing OSNs compared to controls, and is the highest subtype in these animals
(Figure 4D). DE analysis of OR genes supports the striking reciprocal differences in Olfr1507 and
Olfr2-expressing OSNs in the Olfr2 > Olfr1507 animals, but we also find 118 other OSN subtypes
with significant, albeit comparatively subtle, differences (over 90% have fold-changes < 2)
(Figure 4E). Taken together, these data indicate that the extensive variance in OSN subtype compo-
sition we observe in mice is determined by the wider genetic architecture of the animal, and is inde-
pendent of the function of the OR protein each subtype expresses.
To investigate how genetic background influences OSN subtype abundances, we mined 129 and
CAST whole genome sequences (Keane et al., 2011) for SNPs and short indels in regulatory regions
of OR genes. We find that differentially represented OSN subtypes express OR genes with

genetic from environmental influences on OSN diversity. B6 (blue) and 129 (yellow) embryos, depicted as circles, were transferred into F1 recipient
mothers (grey). After birth, the litters were cross-fostered to B6 and 129 mothers, respectively. Each B6 litter received one 129 pup (the alien) and vice
versa. After 10 weeks, the WOM was collected for RNAseq from three aliens from each strain, and one cage-mate each. (B) Heatmap of the expression

each mouse is indicated through shading (right). (C) Differential expression analyses revealed mRNA from only two genes, Olfr875 and Olfr491, that are
significantly altered based on the olfactory environment. Expression values are shown for each group. Blue and yellow boxes indicate B6 or 129 animals

 significantly greater amounts of variation in their coding sequence, whole transcript and regions of
300 bp or 1 kb upstream of the transcription start site, for both the 129 and CAST genomes (Mann-
Whitney one tail, p<0.02 for 129 and p<0.0002 for CAST; Figure 4—figure supplement 1A). Fur-
ther, we scanned OR gene promoters for O/E and HD binding sites. In the CAST genome, 58 and
310 putative OR promoters have gains or losses of O/E and HD-binding sites respectively, compared
to the B6 genome. In contrast, only 12 and 46 OR promoters show differences in the number of O/E
and HD-binding sites, respectively, when comparing the 129 and B6 genomes.
We therefore hypothesized that OSN subtype repertoires are generated via sequence variance in
OR gene promoter and/or local enhancer elements, which dictate the frequency of OR gene choice.
For two OR gene clusters, it has been demonstrated that enhancer/promoter interactions act in cis
and do not influence the expression of the homologous OR allele on the other chromosome
(Fuss et al., 2007; Khan et al., 2011; Nishizumi et al., 2007). However, recent chromosome confor-
mation capture experiments revealed interchromosomal interactions between OR enhancer ele-
ments (Markenscoff-Papadimitriou et al., 2014). Moreover, the differential representation of 118
other OSN subtypes in the Olfr2 > Olfr1507 line (Figure 4E), 108 of which express ORs that are
located on a different chromosome from Olfr1507, is consistent with the possibility that genetic
modification of one OR locus directly influences the probability of choice in other ORs, in trans.
To determine whether the genetic elements that instruct the whole OSN repertoire are cis- or
trans-acting, we carried out an analysis at the OR allele level in B6 � CAST F1 hybrids. Following the
logic of (Goncalves et al., 2012), if the genetic elements act in cis then we would expect the OSN
subtypes that differ between B6 and CAST to be maintained between OSNs expressing the corre-
sponding B6 and CAST alleles within an F1 hybrid. On the other hand, if the elements act in trans
the number of OSNs that express the B6 derived allele in the F1 would not differ from those that
express the CAST allele.
Within F1 mice, 840 OSN subtypes (67.2%) expressed OR mRNAs that could be distinguished at
the allelic level. The ratios between B6 and CAST OSN subtype abundance (F0) strongly correlate
with the ratios between alleles in the F1 hybrids at approximately 1:1 (concordance correlation coef-
ficient (ccc) = 0.86; Figure 4F). In other words, taken across over 800 OSN subtypes, those express-
ing a B6 OR allele in F1 animals have the same repertoire as the B6 parent, while the subtypes
expressing the CAST OR allele match the CAST parent (Figure 4G). To better understand the signifi-
cance of any deviations from 1:1 concordance in specific OSN subtypes, we corrected for technical
noise associated with distinguishing allelic expression at low counts (see Materials and methods; Fig-
ure 4—figure supplement 1B,C). The corrected data has a stronger correlation (ccc = 0.92) and the
best fit of this data matches 1:1 concordance (Cb = 0.999). We therefore conclude that, collectively,
the genetic elements dictating the abundance of over 800 OSN subtypes act in cis. However, we
cannot exclude the possibility that a small contribution from trans-acting elements may account for
subtle deviations from unity for some OSN subtypes.
Taken together, these data are consistent with a predominant model where genetic variation in
local, non-coding regulatory elements determines the probability with which each OR gene is chosen
early in OSN neurogenesis.
Acute but not chronic odor exposure affects OR mRNA expression in
the WOM
Previous studies have shown that OSNs activated by their cognate ligands have increased life-span
(Franc
¸ois et al., 2013; Santoro and Dulac, 2012; Watt et al., 2004). With time, longer survival rates
should translate into enrichment in the neuronal population, compared to those OSN types that are
mostly inactive (Santoro and Dulac, 2012). However, we found no evidence of different strain- or
sex-derived odors influencing the OSN repertoire (Figures 2A and 3B). Because these odor expo-
sures were temporally constant, we hypothesized that the absence of an observed environmental

 influence on OSN repertoire could be due to olfactory adaptation (a reduction of specific olfactory
sensitivity due to prolonged odor exposure, reviewed in [Zufall and Leinders-Zufall, 2000]).
To test this, we exposed mice to a mix of four chemically distinct odorants (acetophenone, euge-
nol, heptanal and (R)-carvone). The odorant mixture was added to the drinking water supplied to
the animals to avoid adaptation, such that they could smell the odor mixture when they approached
the bottle to drink (Figure 5A). We collected the WOM from animals exposed to the odorants for
24 weeks from birth, along with water-exposed controls, and performed RNAseq. DE analysis
reveals 36 OR genes with significantly different mRNA levels (FDR < 5%), with similar numbers more
or less abundant in the exposed animals (Figure 5B, Figure 5—figure supplement 1). We selected
seven OR genes with the biggest fold-changes in mRNA level for which specific TaqMan qPCR
probes were available, and validated their expression levels in a larger cohort. The results indicate
that all the tested genes have mRNA levels that are statistically significantly different from controls
(t-test, FDR < 5%) and the direction of the expression changes are concordant with the RNAseq
data (Figure 5C).
To characterize the temporal dynamics of these OR mRNAs, we tested their expression after dif-
ferent periods of exposure (1, 4 and 10 weeks) in independent samples. After 1 week of treatment,
none showed significant differences from controls, which is expected since young pups do not drink
from the odorized water bottle. After 4 weeks, three of the OR genes are DE from controls, and at
10 weeks, five out of the seven receptors are DE (t-test, FDR < 5%; Figure 5C). To assess the plastic-
ity of these changes, we stimulated a group of animals for four weeks, and then removed the odor
stimuli for an additional 6 weeks. In these mice, none of the OR genes are DE from controls
(Figure 5D). Thus, the abundance of specific OR types in WOM is increasingly altered, over a period
of weeks to months, upon frequent environmental exposure to defined olfactory cues. These differ-
ences are reversible and require persistent stimulation to be maintained.
To investigate whether olfactory adaptation blocks this effect, we presented the same odor mix-
ture on a cotton ball inside a tea strainer (Figure 5E), such that the stimuli are present in a sustained
manner. None of the same seven OR genes are DE after 24 weeks, nor are any consistently dysregu-
lated during the course of the exposure experiment (t-test, FDR < 5%; Figure 5E). Therefore, when
odorants are present in the environment in a constant manner (similar to those differentially pro-
duced by gender or strains of mice), the OR mRNA abundance levels most responsive to acute
exposure remain unchanged.

of the mean normalized counts (x-axis) of OR genes versus the log2 fold-change between Olfr2 > Olfr1507 homozygotes and WT controls (y-axis, n = 4).
OR genes that are significantly differentially expressed are represented in blue. Olfr2 and Olfr1507 are strikingly different, whereas the rest of the
repertoire is equivalent or very slightly altered. (F) Comparison of the fold-change of the CAST versus B6 OR expression (y-axis) to the fold-change
between the CAST and B6 alleles in the F1 (x-axis). The genes fall largely on the 1:1 diagonal (red line) indicating the mRNA expression pattern
observed in the parents is preserved in the F1 and thus OR abundance is controlled in cis. The concordance correlation coefficient (ccc) is indicated,
which quantifies the correlation between the two fold-change estimates while correction for agreement on the x=y line. (G) Examples of the normalized
mRNA expression in the parental strains (top) of an OR gene that is more abundant in CAST (Olfr1535) or in B6 (Olfr598). The corresponding mRNA

 Differential regulation of OR gene mRNAs is odorant-specific
If temporal differences in OR mRNA abundance are a consequence of odorant-specific activity,
exposure to different odorants should lead to the differential expression of discrete subsets of OR
genes. To test this, we odorized the drinking water with (R)-carvone alone, heptanal alone, or with
the combination of both (Figure 6A). After 10 weeks of exposure, we tested the expression of the
seven DE OR mRNAs that were responsive to the four odor mix (acetophenone, eugenol, heptanal
and (R)-carvone), by TaqMan qRT-PCR. None of the genes are significantly DE in the animals
exposed to (R)-carvone alone. However, four of the seven OR genes have mRNA levels significantly
different in the animals exposed to heptanal, or to the combination of both odorants (t-test,
FDR < 5%; Figure 6—figure supplement 1A). We next carried out a transcriptome-wide analysis by
RNAseq, finding 43 OR genes significantly DE in at least one of the conditions (FDR < 5%) of which
32 (74.4%) are upregulated in the odor-stimulated animals (Figure 6B). Exposure to (R)-carvone or
heptanal resulted in a change in mRNA expression of 15 and 20 OR genes, respectively. These sets
of receptors are almost completely independent, with only one OR mRNA significantly upregulated
in both groups (Olfr538; Figure 6C–D). The animals that were exposed to both odorants simulta-
neously showed significant changes in mRNA levels for 24 OR genes, 15 of which are shared with
the individually exposed groups (hypergeometric test, p=1.87 � 10�19). Almost 40% of the ORs that
show significant changes when exposed to all four odorants (Figure 5B) are also significantly altered
in one or more of the groups exposed to (R)-carvone, heptanal or their combination. Thus, together
these data demonstrate that acute environmental exposure to the odorants alters the global expres-
sion of around 1.2–1.6% of OR genes in the WOM. These changes are odor-specific and reproduc-
ible in isolation and in increasingly complex mixtures.
To investigate whether DE OR genes are directly activated by the environmental odorants, we
expressed a subset (Olfr538, Olfr902, Olfr916, Olfr1182, Olfr347 and Olfr524) in a heterologous sys-
tem (Zhuang and Matsunami, 2008) and challenged them with increasing concentrations of (R)-car-
vone and heptanal. Half of the DE ORs we tested were responsive in vitro (Figure 6E–F, Figure 6—
figure supplement 1B): for example, Olfr538 displayed a dose-dependent response to (R)-carvone
(Figure 6E) and Olfr524 was responsive to heptanal (Figure 6F).
Some odorants, including heptanal, are known to be decomposed by enzymes present in the
nasal mucus (Nagashima and Touhara, 2010) such that in vivo exposure to an odorant may result in
stimulation of the OSNs with chemically distinct byproducts. We therefore employed a recently pub-
lished deorphanization system to identify the ORs that respond to heptanal stimulation in vivo
(Jiang et al., 2015). This strategy exploits the phosphorylation of the S6 ribosomal subunit when an
OSN is activated. Thus, by coupling pS6-immunoprecipitation (ps6-IP) and RNAseq, the OR mRNAs
expressed in the activated OSNs can be identified. We exposed mice to two concentrations of hep-
tanal for an hour, and sequenced the mRNAs from OSNs after pS6-IP. Twelve and 210 OR mRNAs
were significantly enriched (FDR < 5%) upon exposure to 1% and 100% heptanal, respectively, com-
pared to controls. Over half of the DE ORs after 10-week acute exposure to heptanal (Figure 6B)
are also DE in the pS6+ cells (11 out of 20; Figure 6G), which is significantly more than expected by

have significantly up- or downregulated mRNAs, respectively. OR genes represented by an asterisk were selected for further validation. (C) qRT-PCR
validation of the DE genes highlighted in (B). The mean fold-change between exposed and control samples is plotted for animals exposed for differing
periods of time (x-axis). After 24 weeks of exposure, all the genes are significantly DE (n = 8–13). (D) Animals were acutely exposed to the odor mix for
four weeks and then the stimulus was removed for 6 weeks. After the recovery period none of the OR mRNAs are significantly different from controls
(n = 8). (E) A chronic exposure paradigm was tested by presenting the odor mix on a cotton ball, placed in the cages of the animals for 24 hr a day. The
WOM was collected at different time-points. The genes previously shown to be DE were tested by qRT-PCR and none show consistent changes in
mRNA levels across time (n = 3–10). T-test, FDR < 5%; * < 0.05, ** < 0.01, *** < 0.001. Error bars are the standard error of the mean. See also

that long-term odor-mediated changes in OR gene expression occurs via direct activation of OSNs
expressing those receptors.
Discussion
We have exploited the power of RNA sequencing and the monogenic and monoallelic nature of OR
gene expression, to comprehensively characterize the full neuronal diversity of a mammalian nose.
We have discovered that the representation of OSN subtypes within an individual is highly unequal
but stereotyped between animals of the same genetic background. We show that non-coding
genetic variation results in high divergence of the relative proportions of different OSN subtypes,
with most being susceptible to altered abundance. OSN diversity is predominantly controlled by
genetic elements that act in cis and the abundance of a given OSN subtype is not affected by the
sequence or function of the receptor it expresses, in a sustained olfactory environment. However,
the persistent but interleaved presentation of olfactory stimuli can alter the representation of specific
ORs in an activity-dependent manner, thus subtly shaping the genetically-encoded neuronal reper-

The MOE is a genetically determined mosaic of OSN subtypes
The process of OR gene choice, stabilization and exclusion during OSN maturation is poorly under-
stood. Occasionally, it is referred to as a random process (McClintock, 2010; Rodriguez, 2013),
suggesting there is no pattern or predictability to the outcome. However, our data indicates that, at
the OSN population level, the result of this process is deterministic. A particular genetic background
in controlled environmental conditions reproducibly generates an OSN population with fixed,
unequal proportions of the different OSN subtypes. Thus, the process that generates this profile is
more accurately described as stochastic. Despite divergence in the profiles generated by different
genomes, all show a similarly shaped distribution: a small proportion of OSN subtypes are present
at high levels with a rapid decay in abundance thereafter. In fact, 3.6% or less of the OSN subtypes
contribute to 25% of the overall neuronal content of the WOM. We find that unequal OSN distribu-
tions are already present at birth (Figure 4A), suggesting the genetic influence is on the process of
OR gene choice/stabilization rather than modulating neuronal survival.
Proximity to the H element, a cluster-specific enhancer, increases the frequency in which an OR is
represented within the OSN population (Khan et al., 2011). Therefore, the most highly represented
OSN types may express OR genes located close to other strong enhancers. However, we propose
that genetic variation in enhancers is not sufficient to account for the full diversity of differences in
OSN subtypes between strains, as different ORs located adjacent to one another within a cluster are
frequently represented very differently. Recently, it has been proposed that higher levels of OR

groups; all the other are specifically altered upon exposure to (R)-carvone or heptanal. (D) Examples of an OR mRNA that changes in all groups

exposed versus control animals with the corresponding p-value on the y-axis. The horizontal line represents the cutoff for significance. Each dot is an
OR gene; those called significantly DE in both assays are shown in black, while those responding in only one experiment are in blue and purple. Half
(11/20) of all the DE genes in the acute exposure experiment are identified in the deorphanization assay, suggesting that the changes are indeed
mediated by OSN activation by heptanal. See also Figure 6—figure supplement 1.

 transcription per cell may result in more OSNs expressing that receptor due to increased success in
a post-selection refinement process (Abdus-Saboor et al., 2016). Our measurements of OR mRNA
expression levels in 63 single OSNs (Figure 1F) do not support this hypothesis. Instead, our data are
consistent with a model where non-uniform probabilities of OR choice are instructed by genetic vari-
ation in both specific OR promoters and enhancers. Supporting this model, we identified many puta-
tive promoters for differentially represented ORs where genetic variation has altered the number of
Olf1/Ebf1 (O/E) and homeodomain (HD) transcription factors binding sites between the mouse
strains, both sequences known to influence the probability of OR choice (D’Hulst et al., 2016;
Vassalli et al., 2011). Moreover, through analysis of F1 hybrids, we confirmed the finding that the
probability of choice of OR genes linked to the H element are regulated in cis (Fuss et al., 2007),
and extended this to over 800 additional OR genes distributed throughout the genome that show
little to no evidence in support of trans-acting regulation. Instead, the haploid CAST- and B6-derived
OR alleles within an F1 are each regulated almost identically as they are in a diploid state within their
original genetic backgrounds (Figure 4F,G). Our data are inconsistent with trans-interactions of mul-
tiple

to

of

choice
(Markenscoff-
Papadimitriou et al., 2014). These trans interactions may, however, stabilize or maintain OR singu-
larity after choice has been instructed in cis, and thus could also be necessary for the stereotypic
representation of OSNs in a fixed genetic background.
Many existing studies into OR gene choice, especially those utilizing transgenic mouse lines, use
animals with a mixed 129/B6 genetic background. The remarkable diversity in the OSN repertoire
between these strains (Figure 2) suggests caution should be exercised in their interpretation. Here,
we created a mouse line that carries the coding sequence of Olfr2 in the locus of Olfr1507, the most
frequently selected OR gene, in a pure B6 genetic background. Olfr2-expressing OSNs, which rank
334th across the repertoire in the original B6 strain, are the most abundant OSN subtype in this
modified line, demonstrating the critical importance of the genetic context in the regulation of the
probability of OR gene choice. Curiously, we also observed that ~10% of other OSN types show
comparatively subtle but reproducible differences in abundance. The mechanism underlying these
differences is unclear. One plausible hypothesis is that the transposition of Olfr2 OSNs to a different
olfactory zone alters the dynamics and spatial organization of the glomeruli in the olfactory bulb.
This in turn may impact on the proliferation and survival of proximal OSN subtypes. Alternatively,
stabilizing trans interactions could be affected by the OR gene swap, resulting in slightly altered rep-
ertoires for some OSN subtypes. In this case, the sequence of an OR receptor gene would influence
the relative abundance of other OSN subtypes, but our Olfr2 > Olfr1507 swap experiment suggests
the sequence of an OR receptor does not dictate the abundance of its own OSN subtype.
Odor-mediated plasticity in the olfactory system
The main olfactory epithelium regenerates throughout the life of an animal. It has been suggested
that activity-mediated mechanisms may shape the olfactory system by increasing OSN survival
(Franc
¸ois et al., 2013; Santoro and Dulac, 2012; Watt et al., 2004; Zhao and Reed, 2001),
although other studies have found that the number of specific OSN subtypes decrease or are unaf-
fected by odor-exposure (Cadiou et al., 2014; Cavallin et al., 2010). Each of these studies focused
on one or two OSN subtypes and the odor exposure procedures varied significantly in frequency,
persistence and length. Here, we took a comprehensive approach, measuring the response of over
1,000 ORs to four odorants, after different types of exposure from 1 week to 6 months. We find that
mice living in stable chemical environments maintain the olfactory transcriptomes of their
genetically dictated OSN repertoire. However, when frequently recurring odor stimulation is intro-
duced, the abundances of responsive ORs are modified. We propose that this difference is a result
of olfactory adaptation in the presence of continuous stimulation. However, other factors may also
contribute, for example the continuous exposure odors were likely detected orthonasally, while the
intermittently exposure odors were retronasally detected.
The lengthy timeframe for odor-mediated differences to emerge is consistent with modulation of
OSN lifespan. It is mechanistically unlikely that odor-activity could influence the probability of OR
gene choice, but it could promote OR expression stabilization or singularity. Compared to the dra-
matic influence of genetic variation on OSN repertoire, odor-evoked changes are subtle, typically
less than a two fold change after 6 months of exposure. The limited effect magnitude and long-time
scales precluded a more detailed analysis to confirm a correlative alteration in OSN number.

 Interestingly, we identified ORs that became more abundant after exposure to specific odorants
and, within the same animals, others that became less abundant. Both types were marked by phos-
phorylation of the S6 ribosomal subunit, a feature of activated OSNs (Jiang et al., 2015), indicating
that the differential expression is mediated by OSN subtype-specific olfactory stimulation. This may
explain why very different conclusions were drawn from previous exposure studies on a small num-
ber of ORs (Cadiou et al., 2014; Cavallin et al., 2010; Franc
¸ois et al., 2013; Watt et al., 2004).
Short-term odor exposures (30 min to 24 hr) result in a temporary down-regulation of activated OR
mRNA (von der Weid et al., 2015), presumably as part of the olfactory adaptation process. It is pos-
sible that our analyses are capturing this dynamic short-term response in addition to changes in
OSN numbers resulting from long-term exposures. We could not identify any phylogenetic or chro-
mosomal predictor of the ORs that responded with contrasting directional effects, and at this time,
the logic underpinning the difference in the direction of expression changes remains unexplained.
An individually unique olfactory nose
Genetic variation has great impact on individual phenotypic traits. Humans differ in up to a third of
their OR alleles by functional variation (Mainland et al., 2014), which contributes to an individually
unique sense of smell (Secundo et al., 2015). Segregating OR alleles have been functionally linked
to perceptual differences of their odor ligands, by altering intensity, valence or detection threshold
(Jaeger et al., 2013; Keller et al., 2007; Mainland et al., 2014; McRae et al., 2013;
Menashe et al., 2007). However, in most cases, these OR coding genetic variants explain only a
small proportion of the observed phenotypic variance (reviewed in Logan [2014]), suggesting that
other factors contribute to individual differences in perception. Recently, it has been demonstrated
that increasing the number of a particular OSN subtype in a mouse nose increases olfactory sensitiv-
ity to its ligand (D’Hulst et al., 2016). Therefore, the very different OSN repertoires present
between strains of mice are likely to result in significant phenotypic variation in olfactory thresholds,
and thus contribute to the individualization of olfaction.
Although it remains to be determined whether human OSN repertoires are as variable as the
mice reported here, an array-based study of OR expression in 26 humans found unequal expression
of ORs within and between individual noses (Verbeurgt et al., 2014). Moreover, a recent systematic
survey of olfactory perception in humans found high levels of individual variability in reporting the
intensity of some odors (for example, benzenethiol and 3-pentanone) but not others (Keller and
Vosshall, 2016). Further, a non-coding variant within an OR cluster associated with insensitivity to 2-
heptanone has been shown to be dominant to the sensitive allele (McRae et al., 2013). As OR genes
are regulated monoallelicaly, this implies that a 50% reduction in the sensitive OR allele dosage is, in
some cases, sufficient to influence perception. On the other hand, because many odorants activate
multiple OSN subtypes (Malnic et al., 1999), a differential representation of one subtype may have
a limited influence on the overall perception of its odor.
Further investigation into the functional consequence of diverse OSN repertoires will be neces-
sary to determine the full extent to which they individualize the sense of smell.
Materials and methods
RNA sequencing
Animal experiments were carried out under the authority of a UK Home Office license (80/2472),
after review by the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Board. All
mice were housed in single sex groups within individually ventilated cages, with access to food and
water ad libitum. All WOM samples were obtained from a single animal, except the pup WOM sam-
ples, which were the pool of three or four individuals. Details of the strain, age and sex of each ani-
mal sequenced can be found in Supplementary file 1. MOEs were dissected and immediately
homogenized in lysis RLT buffer (Qiagen, Germantown, Maryland). Total RNA was extracted using
the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) with on-column DNAse digestion, following the manufacturer’s proto-
col. mRNA was prepared for sequencing using the TruSeq RNA sample preparation kit (Illumina, San
Diego, California). All RNA sequencing was paired-end and produced 100-nucleotide-long reads.

structed gene models for OR genes as reported in (Ibarra-Soria et al., 2014).

(RRID:SCR_005514),

(Anders et al., 2015). Raw counts were normalized to account for sequencing depth between sam-
ples, using the procedure implemented in the DESeq2 package (Love et al., 2014). Data analysis,
statistical testing and plotting were carried out in R (http://www.R-project.org).
To compare OR expression levels between datasets, normalization to account for the number of
OSNs present in the WOM samples was carried out subsequent to depth normalization. For this, we
used a method proposed by Khan et al. (2013) that uses marker genes known to be stably
expressed in mature OSNs only. This allows estimating the proportion of WOM RNA contributed by
the OSNs. Five different marker genes were considered: Omp, Adcy3, Ano2, Cnga2 and Gnal
(except for the single-cell data, where Adcy3 and Ano2 were excluded because they are not
expressed in many cells). To normalize for OSN number, we first computed the correlation coeffi-
cient between the expression of each marker gene and the total counts in OR genes; those marker
genes with strong correlation values were used for normalization. Then, we calculated the geometric
mean of all marker genes for each sample. The average of all geometric means was obtained, and
divided by each individual mean; this results in the generation of size factors. Finally, the OR normal-
ized counts were multiplied by the corresponding size factor. Normalized OR expression estimates
for the three strains, the Olfr2 > Olfr1507 and the odor-exposed animals are provided in Figure 2—
source data 1, Figure 4—source data 1, Figure 5—source data 1 and Figure 6—source data 1.
Differential expression analysis
Differential expression analysis was performed with DESeq2 1.8.1 (Love et al., 2014) with standard
parameters. To test for differential expression (DE) on the OR repertoire the double normalized
counts (accounting for OSN number per sample) were provided directly, and the normalizationFac-
tors function was used with size factors of 1 to turn off further normalization. Genes were considered
significantly DE if they had an adjusted p-value of 0.05 or less. For the cross-fostering dataset, a like-
lihood ratio test (nbinomLRT function in DESeq2) was used to compare the full model genetics+envi-
ironment+genetics:environment to a reduced one accounting only for the genetics. Detailed results
are provided in Figure 2—source data 1, Figure 4—source data 1, Figure 5—source data 1 and
Figure 6—source data 1.

Probes were designed against nine OR genes chosen among genes covering the receptor expres-
sion dynamic range and DE between 129 and B6 strains (Olfr24, Olfr31, Olfr78, Olfr124, Olfr323,
Olfr374, Olfr543, Olfr736 and Olfr1512). The following gene-specific oligonucleotides were used to

The reverse primer in each case includes the T7 RNA polymerase promoter sequence, and both
oligos were designed to amplify a fragment with <75% sequence similarity to other OR genes in the
mouse genome. Amplicons were purified from the PCR reactions using the Wizard PCR cleanup kit
(Promega, Fitchburg, Wisconsin) and used in riboprobe in vitro transcription with T7 RNA polymer-
ase (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts) and DIG-labeled UTP.
WOM from 10-week-old 129 or B6 mice were collected by dissection, fixed for 48 hr in 4% para-
formaldehyde in 1x PBS and demineralized for 10 days in 0.45M EDTA pH 8.0/1x PBS. Samples were
then cryoprotected in 0.45M EDTA pH 8.0/1x PBS/20% sucrose for 24 hr, before embedding in OCT
medium and sectioning on a Leica CM1850 cryostat to produce slides containing 16 mm coronal
MOE sections. Slides were air-dried for 10 min, followed by fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde for
20 min, and treated with 0.1M HCl for 10 min. Tissue acetylation proceeded in 250 mL of 0.1M trie-
thanolamine (pH 8.0) with 1 mL of acetic anhydride for 10 min, with gentle stirring. Two washes in
1� PBS were performed between incubations.
Riboprobe hybridization was done with DIG-labeled probes (1000 ng/mL) at 60˚C in hybridization
buffer (50% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, 600 mM NaCl, 200 mg/mL yeast tRNA, 0.25% SDS, 10
mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 1� Denhardt’s solution, 1 mM EDTA pH 8.0) overnight. Post-hybridization
washes included one wash in 2� SSC, one wash in 0.2� SSC and one wash in 0.1� SSC at 55˚C, for
30, 20 and 20 min, respectively. Tissue permeabilization was performed in 1� PBS, 0.1% Tween-20
for 10 min, followed by two washes in TN buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl) for 5 min
at room temperature, followed by blocking in TNB buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl,
0.05% blocking reagent [Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts]). Slides were then incubated over-
night at 4˚C with sheep anti-DIG-AP (Roche, Germany) diluted in TNB (1:800), washed in TNT (100
mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% Tween 20) six times, 5 min each, transferred to alkaline
phosphatase buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl pH 9.8, 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM MgCl2, 0.1% Tween 20) twice
for 5 min each.
Signal development was performed in the same buffer containing 5% poly-vinyl alcohol (Mowiol
MW 31,000, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri), 50 mg/mL BCIP and 100 mg/mL NBT, until the purple
precipitate was clearly visible with minimum background. Due to the large size of each MOE section,
we collected serially scanned images with the ’Scan Large Image’ function on NIS Elements software
(3.22 version, Nikon Instruments), on a motorized upright Nikon Eclipse 90i microscope equipped
with a planar PlanFluor 10x/0.30 DIC L/N1 objective (Nikon, Japan). Background correction was
applied on individual images with the NIS elements software and stitched together using Image
Composite Editor (Microsoft, Redmond, Washington) with no projection. Linear image adjustments
were performed on Photoshop, using the ’Brightness and Contrast’ and ’Levels’ functions, to equal-
ize the background tone across images. OR-expressing cells were counted by visual inspection. For
each gene, three to four animals were analyzed; two to four sections were counted for each animal,
and the cell counts were collected independently for each MOE side (hemi-section). The mean num-
ber of OR-positive cells per section was calculated (from the two hemi-section counts), followed by

 calculation of the mean number of OR-positive cells per animal (from the two to four counted sec-
tions). Mean and s.e.m. descriptive statistics were then calculated across the three to four animals
analyzed.
Proportional venn diagrams
Venn diagrams with areas proportional to the number of elements represented were created using
the eulerAPE version 3 software (Micallef and Rodgers, 2014).
Identification of copy number variable OR genes in the CAST genome
We mined the Mouse Genomes Project data (Keane et al., 2011), release v5 (http://www.sanger.ac.
uk/science/data/mouse-genomes-project; RRID:IMSR_JAX:000928). Regions with high numbers of
het SNPs indicate multiple alleles being mapped to a single locus in the reference genome. The
sequences in the C57BL/6J (RRID:IMSR_JAX:000664) genome (GRCm38) for OR genes with het
SNPs in CAST were used to construct a neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree using MEGA6
(Tamura et al., 2013). From the tree we selected 33 clades that contained the OR genes with high-
est number of het SNPs. Then we extracted all of the CAST/EiJ whole-genome Illumina sequencing
reads produced by the Mouse Genomes Project that were mapped to these loci (http://www.
sanger.ac.uk/science/data/mouse-genomes-project) (Keane et al., 2011), realigned these to the
members of the respective clade, and then extracted the read pairs poorly aligned to known Olfr
members (>2% mismatch). We created a de novo assembly of these reads to produce a set of con-
tigs with Geneious R7 (Kearse et al., 2012). The contigs were scaffolded and gap-filled using the llu-
mina reads. From the resulting scaffold sequences, we identified putative new alleles in CAST/EiJ
(Supplementary file 1). The new allele’s sequences are reported in Figure 2—source data 2.
Genetic or environmental effects on OR expression
To dissect the influence of the genetic background from the olfactory environment, C57BL/6N and
129S5 four- to eight-cell stage embryos were transferred into F1 (C57BL/6J�CBA) pseudo-pregnant
females. One day after birth, the C57BL/6N and 129S5 litters were cross-fostered to C57BL/6N and
129S5 wild-type mothers, respectively. Then, a single pup from the other strain was transferred to
the cross-fostered litter (the alien). At weaning, animals from the same sex as the alien animal were
kept, always in a 4:1 ratio between strains. If not enough animals of the correct sex were available in
the litter, surplus animals from other litters were used. At 10 weeks of age, the WOM was collected
form the alien and a randomly selected cage-mate, and RNA was extracted and sequenced as
described.
Generation of the Olfr2 > Olfr1507 mice
CRISPR-Cas9 technology was used to generate double strand breaks on either side of the Olfr1507
coding sequence and facilitate homologous recombination. Two guideRNAs -with sequences AAAC
TAGATACTTGGCTCATAGG
and
CATATTCTAGACATTGTCATAGG-
were
produced
with
the
Ambion T7 MEGAshortscript kit and the Cas9 RNA with the Ambion mMessage mMachine T7 Ultra
kit (ThermoFisher Scientific) as specified by the manufacturer’s protocols. All RNA were purified with
Ambion MegaClear columns, eluting with pre-heated (95˚C) elution solution. The eluate was then
precipitated with ammonium acetate, and resuspended in ultrapure water (Sigma-Aldrich).
For homologous recombination, we produced a DNA vector containing the coding sequence of
Olfr2 and homology arms for the Olfr1507 locus of ~1 kb. This was cloned into a modified pUC19
backbone via Gibson Assembly. The sequence-verified plasmid was purified with the NucleoBond
Xtra Midi Plus EF Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific) following the manufacturer’s protocol. The plasmid
was digested to remove the backbone and gel-purified with the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qia-
gen) following the kit’s protocol. The DNA was precipitated with sodium acetate and resuspended
in ultrapure water (Sigma-Aldrich). Finally, the DNA was spin through an Ultrafree-MC centrifugal fil-
ter (Merck, Germany).
All components were microinjected into the cytoplasm of 112 C57BL/6N zygotes at the following
concentrations: 25 ng/ml for each gRNA, 100 ng/ml of Cas9 RNA and 200 ng/ml of vector DNA.
Thirty-eight pups were born and four were positive for the homologous recombination event. One
of these was the correct substitution, while the others contained several copies of the DNA vector.

 To map the RNAseq data from the Olfr2 > Olfr1507 homozygous mice, we modified the refer-
ence B6 mouse genome (GRCm38) to substitute the Olfr1507 CDS with that of Olfr2. Additionally,
the Olfr2 CDS in the endogenous locus was removed to avoid multimapping. All the counts from
both the endogenous Olfr2 UTRs and the modified Olfr1507 locus were added together and
reported as the Olfr2 counts; Olfr1507 was set to zero. The WT controls were mapped to the
unmodified reference genome. Data processing and DE analysis were performed as previously
described.
Identification of transcription-factor-binding sites
We used the RegionMiner tool from the Genomatix software suite (https://www.genomatix.de/solu-
tions/genomatix-software-suite.html) to identify overrepresented transcription factor binding sites
(TFBSs) in the regions 1 kb upstream of the transcription start site of OR genes as annotated in
(Ibarra-Soria et al., 2014), for all B6, 129 and CAST sequences. We extracted the match details for
the matrix families NOLF and HOMF (Matrix Family Library version 9.3), which correspond to Olf1/
Ebf1 and homeodomain TFs, respectively. Ad hoc perl scripts were used to parse out the core
sequence coordinates of each motif match (defined as the central 10 nucleotides of the reported
match), and then to compare the results for each promoter across the strains. We identified those
OR genes that had differing number of predicted sites. The number and coordinates of the pre-
dicted TFBS are provided in Figure 4—source data 2.
Allelic discrimination of the F1 RNAseq data
The RNAseq data from the WOM of B6 x CAST F1 hybrids were obtained from a pre-publication
release by the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute (ERP004533). Data was processed as described
above. Total expression estimates were obtained by mapping the RNAseq data to the B6 or
pseudo-CAST genomes, with standard parameters. The expression estimates obtained with each
genome were very highly correlated (rho = 0.99, p<2.2 � 10�16). Therefore, the data mapped to the
B6 reference was used in downstream analyses.
To obtain allele-specific expression estimates, the RNAseq data was mapped to both the B6 and
the pseudo-CAST genomes, without mismatches. Therefore, reads that span SNPs could only map
to the genome corresponding to the allele they come from. Subsequent analyses were performed
on the OR repertoire only. All reads mapped across each SNP were retrieved with SAMtools (RRID:
SCR_002105) (Li et al., 2009); ad hoc perl scripts were used to exclude reads that splice across the
SNP or that were not uniquely mapped. Finally, the number of different reads mapping across all
SNPs of each gene was obtained.
To normalize for depth of sequencing, the total expression raw data was combined with the esti-
mates from the parental strains, and normalized all together. The OR data was then further normal-
ized to account for the number of OSNs, as described above. The same size factors were used to
normalize the expression estimates from SNP positions.
To deconvolve the total expression into allele-specific expression, a ratio of the expression of
each allele was obtained from the counts in SNP positions by dividing the counts in B6 over the total
counts in B6 and CAST. Then, the total expression normalized counts were multiplied by the ratio to
obtain the B6 expression, and to the inverse of the ratio for the CAST-specific expression. Only
those genes with normalized counts in SNP positions above the lowest quartile were used (840 OR
genes).
To estimate the amount of technical noise inherent to allelic expression estimation in genes with
low counts such as the ORs, we created an in silico F1 dataset. To do this, we used SAMtools
(Li et al., 2009) to downsample the F0 B6 and CAST samples to 50% of the median depth of the F1
samples; we used the three male B6 samples only. We combined each B6 sample with a CAST sam-
ple to create an F1 where the contribution from each allele was 50%. We processed the resulting F1
data as described above. The ratio of the two alleles in the F1 data should match the corresponding
ratios in the parental calculations, and we can attribute any deviations from unity to technical noise.
Thus, we computed the deviation form the x = y line for each gene in the in silico F1 and used it to
correct the fold-change estimate between the allelic expression values in the real F1 data. We used
the concordance correlation coefficient as a measurement of the correlation of the fold-change esti-
mates between the parental and allelic expression values (Lin, 1989). Unlike a regular correlation

 coefficient, it corrects for the agreement on the x = y line, where the data should fall if regulation
occurs in cis. Furthermore, it provides the parameter Cb which quantifies the deviation of the best fit
to the data from the x = y line; Cb = 1 means no deviation. For both the in silico F1 and the real F1
data, the Cb was 0.99, indicating that the OR repertoire as a whole lies on the diagonal.
Odor-exposure in vivo
B6 mice were exposed to a mix of heptanal, (R)-carvone, eugenol and acetophenone at 1 mM con-
centration each, diluted in mineral oil (all odorants from Sigma-Aldrich except acetophenone, from
Alfa Aesar). For the acute exposure experiments, the odor mix was added to the water bottles of
the animals; mineral oil alone was used for controls. Water bottles were replaced twice a week with
freshly prepared ones. The exposure started from at least embryonic day (E)14.5 and the WOM was
collected from age-matched exposed and control groups at different time-points after the start of
the treatment. For the chronic exposure experiments, the odor mixture or mineral oil only, were
applied to a cotton ball with a plastic pasteur pipette; these were put into metal tea strainers that
were then introduced into the cage of the animals. The cotton ball was replaced fresh daily. The
exposure started from birth and the WOM was collected from age-matched exposed and control
groups at different time-points after the start of the treatment.
For the follow-up experiments, animals were acutely exposed only to (R)-carvone, or heptanal, or
to the combination of both. The final concentration of each odorant was 1 mM. The odorants were
directly added to the water bottles, without dilution in mineral oil. Therefore, the controls were kept
with pure water. The water bottles were changed twice a week. The exposure started from at least
E16.5 and the WOM was collected at 10 weeks of age.
qRT-PCR expression estimation
For qRT-PCR experiments, RNA from WOM was extracted as previously described. 1 mg of RNA was
reversed-transcribed
into
cDNA
using
the
High-Capacity
RNA-to-cDNA
kit
(Applied
Biosystems, Waltham, Massachusetts) with the manufacturer’s protocol. Predesigned TaqMan gene
expression assays were used on a 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System (ThermoFisher Scientific) fol-
lowing the manufacturer’s instructions. Mean cycle threshold (Ct) values were obtained from two
technical replicates, each normalized to Actb using the DCt method. Relative quantity (RQ) values
were calculated using the formula RQ = 2DCt. Differential expression between groups was tested in
R, by a two-tailed t-test, with multiple-testing correction by the Benjamini and Hochberg (FDR)
method.
Luciferase assay
For OR response in vitro, a Dual-Glo Luciferase Assay System (Promega) was employed using the
previously described method (Zhuang and Matsunami, 2008). Modified HEK293T cells, Hana3A
cells, were obtained directly from the Matsunami Laboratory. Cell line identity and negative myco-
plasma status was confirmed by PCR after the completion of all experiments. Cells were plated on
96-well
PDL
plates
(ThermoFisher
Scientific)
for
transfection
with
5
ng/well
of
RTP1S-pCI
(Saito et al., 2004; Zhuang and Matsunami, 2007), 5 ng/well of pSV40-RL, 10 ng/well pCRE-luc,
2.5 ng/well of M3-R-pCI (Li and Matsunami, 2011), and 5 ng/well of plasmids encompassing the six
olfactory receptors of interest. (R)-carvone and heptanal (Sigma-Aldrich) were diluted to a 1 mM
solution in CD293 (ThermoFisher Scientific) from 1M stocks in DMSO. 24 hr following transfection,
we applied 10-fold serial dilutions of each odorant from 1 mM to 1 nM in triplicate. Luminescence
was
measured
after
a
4-hr
odor
stimulation
period
using
a
Synergy
two
plate
reader
(BioTek, Winooski, Vermont). Transfection efficiency was controlled for by normalizing all lumines-
cence values by the Renilla luciferase activity. The data were fit to a sigmoidal curve and every OR-
odorant pair was compared to a vector-only control using an extra sums-of-squares F test (signifi-
cantly different from empty vector if p<0.05, the s.d. of the fitted log(EC50) was less than one log
unit, and the 95% confidence intervals of the top and bottom parameters did not overlap). Data
were analyzed with GraphPad Prism 7.00 and R.

 pS6 immunoprecipitation and RNAseq
Three- to four-week old C57BL/6 mice were placed individually into sealed containers (volume »
2.7L) inside a fume hood and allowed to rest for 1 hr in an odorless environment. For odor stimulus,
10 ml odor solution or 10 ml distilled water (control) was applied to 1cm � 1cm filter paper held in a
cassette. The cassette was placed into a new mouse container into which the mouse was also trans-
ferred, and the mouse was exposed to the odor solution or control for 1 hr. Experiments were per-
formed in triplicates or quadruplicates, and within each replication the experimental and control
mice were littermates of the same sex.
Following odor stimulation, the mouse was sacrificed and the OE was dissected in 25 ml of dis-
section buffer (1 � HBSS ( with Ca2+ and Mg2+), 2.5 mM HEPES (pH 7.4 adjusted with KOH), 35 mM
glucose, 100 mg/ml cycloheximide, 5 mM sodium fluoride, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1 mM
sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM beta–glycerophosphate) on ice. The dissected OE was transferred to
1.35 ml homogenization buffer (150 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4 adjusted with
KOH), 100 nM Calyculin A, 2 mM DTT, 100 U/ml RNasin (Promega), 100 mg/ml cycloheximide, 5 mM
sodium fluoride, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM beta–glycero-
phosphate, protease inhibitor (Roche, one tablet/10 ml)) and homogenized three times at 250 rpm
and nine times at 750 rpm. The homogenate was transferred to a 1.5 ml lobind tube
(Eppendorf, Germany), and centrifuged at 4600 rpm for 10 min at 4˚C. The supernatant was then
transferred to a new 1.5 ml lobind tube, to which 90 ml 10% NP–40 and 90 ml 300 mM DHPC (Avanti
Polar Lipids, Alabaster, Alabama) was added. The mixture was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min
at 4˚C. The supernatant was transferred to a new 1.5 ml lobind tube, and mixed with 20 ml pS6 anti-
body (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, Massachusetts). Antibody binding was allowed by incu-
bating the mixture for 1.5 hr at 4˚C with rotation. During antibody binding, Protein A Dynabeads
(ThermoFisher Scientific, 100 ml/sample) was washed three times with 900 ml beads wash buffer 1
(150mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4 adjusted with KOH), 0.05% BSA, 1% NP–40).
After antibody binding, the mixture was added to the washed beads and gently mixed, followed by
incubation for 1 hr at 4˚C with rotation. After incubation, the RNA-bound beads were washed 4
times with 700 ml beads wash buffer 2 (RNase free water containing 350 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 10
mM HEPES (pH 7.4 adjusted with KOH), 1% NP–40, 2 mM DTT, 100 U/ml recombinant RNasin
(Promega), 100 mg/ml cycloheximide, 5 mM sodium fluoride, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1 mM
sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM beta–glycerophosphate). During the final wash, beads were placed
onto the magnet and moved to room temperature. After removing supernatant, RNA was eluted by
mixing the beads with 350 ml RLT (Qiagen). The eluted RNA was purified using RNeasy Micro kit
(Qiagen). Chemicals were purchased from Sigma if not specified otherwise.
1.5 ml purified RNA was mixed with 5 ml reaction mix (1� PCR buffer (Roche), 1.5 mM MgCl2, 50

poly–T
primer
(TATAGAATTCGCGGCCGCTCGCGA
TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT), 0.04 U/ml RNase inhibitor (Qiagen), 0.4 U/ml recombinant RNasin

Superscript II (ThermoFisher Scientific), 0.4 U/ml RNase inhibitor (Qiagen), 4 U/ml recombinant RNasin
(Promega), 3 mg/ml T4 gene 32 protein (Roche)) was added to each tube and incubated at 37˚C for
10 min then at 65˚C for 10 min. 1 ml ExoI mix (2 U/ml ExoI (NEB), 1� PCR buffer (Roche), 1.5 mM
MgCl2) was added to each tube and incubated at 37˚C for 15 min then 80˚C for 15 min. 5 ml TdT mix
(1.25 U/ml TdT (Roche), 0.1 U/ml RNase H (ThermoFisher Scientific), 1� PCR buffer (Roche), 3 mM
dATP, 1.5 mM MgCl2) was added to each tube and incubated at 37˚C for 20 min then 65˚C for 10
min. 3.5 ml of the product was added to 27.5 ml PCR mix (1� LA Taq reaction buffer
(TaKaRa, Japan), 0.25 mM dNTPs, 20 ng/ml poly–T primer, 0.05 U/ml LA Taq (TaKaRa)) and incubated
at 95˚C for 2 min, 37˚C for 5 min, 72˚C for 20 min, then 16 cycles of 95˚C for 30 s, 67˚C for 1 min,
72˚C for 3 min with 6 s extension for each cycle, and then 72˚C for 10 min. The PCR product was
purified by gel purification, and 50 ng of the purified product was used for library preparation with
Nextera DNA Sample Prep kits (Illumina). Libraries were sequenced on a HiSeq 2000/2500 (12 librar-
ies pooled per lane) to produce 50 base pair single-end reads. The sequencing data have been
deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) under
accession GSE87695.
Short reads were aligned to the mouse reference genome mm10 using Bowtie (Langmead et al.,
2009). The reads mapped to annotated genes were then counted using BEDTools (Quinlan and
