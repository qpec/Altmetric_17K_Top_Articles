IntroductIon
Glioblastoma is the most prevalent primary intrinsic brain 
tumor. Despite surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, glioblas-
tomas remain lethal, with a median survival below two years 
(Stupp et al., 2009). Glioblastoma is a heterogeneous disease, 
with extensive contributions from nontransformed cells and 
a cellular hierarchy within the neoplastic compartment. Atop 
the hierarchy resides a self-renewing, tumorigenic, stem-like 
tumor cell population called glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) 
or tumor-initiating cells (Chen et al., 2012). GSCs contribute 
to tumor malignancy due to sustained proliferation, promo-
tion of angiogenesis, invasive potential, immune escape, and 
therapeutic resistance (Bao et al., 2006; Alvarado et al., 2017).
Unlike many lethal cancers, glioblastomas rarely metas-
tasize out of the central nervous system (CNS), and a ma-
jority of patients suffer recurrence within 2–3 cm of the 
original resection cavity (Wallner et al., 1989); this behav-
ior has prompted investigation of local therapies, including 
oncolytic viruses (Martuza et al., 1991; Alonso et al., 2012; 
Kaufmann and Chiocca, 2014; Miska et al., 2016; Cassady et 
al., 2017; Cattaneo and Russell, 2017). Efficacy of virother-
apy against tumors depends on the ability to infect and kill 
tumor cells specifically (Cattaneo and Russell, 2017). Sev-
eral oncolytic DNA viruses have been developed to achieve 
tumor cell killing with limited toxicity (Martuza et al., 
1991; Alonso et al., 2012).
Zika virus (ZIKV) is a member of the flavivirus genus 
of RNA viruses, which includes dengue, West Nile virus 
(WNV), and yellow fever viruses. The recent outbreak of 
ZIKV-induced fetal microcephaly has spurred extensive re-
search into its cell tropism (Garcez et al., 2016; Lazear et al., 
2016; Li et al., 2016; Ming et al., 2016; Qian et al., 2016; 
Shan et al., 2016). ZIKV infects the developing CNS, with 
neural stem and progenitor cells prominently affected. Neu-
ral precursors infected with ZIKV undergo differentiation, 
loss of proliferation, and cell death (Gromeier et al., 2000; 
Li et al., 2016; Ming et al., 2016; Qian et al., 2016; Gabriel 
et al., 2017). In contrast, the effects of ZIKV in adults are 
generally less severe, with rare cases of meningoencephalitis, 
suggesting that ZIKV infection has fewer deleterious effects 
in the adult brain (Parra et al., 2016). We hypothesized that 
the tropism of ZIKV for neural precursor cells could be lev-
eraged against glioblastomas.
Glioblastoma is a highly lethal brain cancer that frequently recurs in proximity to the original resection cavity. We explored 
the use of oncolytic virus therapy against glioblastoma with Zika virus (ZIKV), a flavivirus that induces cell death and differ-
entiation of neural precursor cells in the developing fetus. ZIKV preferentially infected and killed glioblastoma stem cells 
(GScs) relative to differentiated tumor progeny or normal neuronal cells. the effects against GScs were not a general property 
of neurotropic flaviviruses, as West nile virus indiscriminately killed both tumor and normal neural cells. ZIKV potently de-
pleted patient-derived GScs grown in culture and in organoids. Moreover, mice with glioblastoma survived substantially longer 
and at greater rates when the tumor was inoculated with a mouse-adapted strain of ZIKV. our results suggest that ZIKV is an 
oncolytic virus that can preferentially target GScs; thus, genetically modified strains that further optimize safety could have 
therapeutic efficacy for adult glioblastoma patients.

 Zika virus has oncolytic activity against GSCs | Zhu et al.
2844
reSultS and dIScuSSIon
ZIKV infects human GScs and inhibits proliferation in vitro
To interrogate the effects of ZIKV on glioblastoma, we 
used patient-derived GSCs that express stem cell mark-
ers, self-renew, have differentiation potential, and form 
tumors upon xenotransplantation, as well as differentiated 
glioma cells (DGCs; Bao et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2017). 
We selected four GSC models representing the major 
transcriptional glioblastoma subtypes—proneural, classical, 
and mesenchymal—and induced cellular differentiation 
through serum exposure (Bao et al., 2006). We infected 
GSCs (Fig. 1 A; multiplicity of infection [MOI] of 5) with 
representative African (Dakar 1984) and American (Bra-
zil 2015) ZIKV strains. 7 d later, spheres were obliterated 
(Fig. 1 B). Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated 
that greater than 60% of GSCs were infected by either 
strain at 48 h after infection (Fig. 1, C and D). We analyzed 
the fraction of ZIKV-infected cells that expressed a GSC 
marker (SOX2); greater than 90% of infected cells were 
SOX2+ (Fig. 1, E and F; and Fig. S1 A). Flow cytometry 
results were consistent with the microscopy data (Fig. S1, 
B–G) and demonstrated that the percentage of infected 
GSCs increased over time, consistent with virus spread. We 
next determined the impact of ZIKV on matched GSCs 
and DGCs. ZIKV could infect DGCs, but at a significantly 
lower rate than GSCs (Fig. S1, H and I). Infectious yield 
assays corroborated higher ZIKV levels from GSCs than 
from DGCs (Fig. S1, J and K). Whereas GSC proliferation 
was abolished by either ZIKV strain (Fig. 1, B and G), 
DGCs were nearly unaffected (Fig. 1 H). Sphere formation 
in serum-free conditions has been used as a surrogate for 
self-renewal (Reynolds and Weiss, 1992). Consistent with 
its preferential targeting of GSCs, ZIKV reduced GSC 
sphere formation (Fig. 1 I). These effects on cell number 
and sphere formation were also associated with reduc-
tions in SOX2 expression and proliferation (measured by 
Ki-67) and increases in apoptosis (measured by activated 
caspase-3 [AC3]; Fig. 1, J–N).
the selective effects of ZIKV on GScs 
are not observed with WnV
More than 60 yr ago, WNV was tested for its oncolytic 
efficacy but displayed substantial toxicity (Southam and 
Moore, 1952; Moore, 1954). We compared the effects of 
WNV (New York 1999) to those of ZIKV in our models. 
WNV infected both GSCs and DGCs to high levels (Fig. 
S2, A–G), inducing death in both cell types (Fig. S2, A and 
B). WNV also infected normal human neural cells in cul-
ture and brain slices from freshly resected epilepsy tissues 
and targeted NeuN+ neurons and GFAP+ astrocytes (Fig. 
S2, H–K). WNV continued to infect cells over time (Fig. 
S2 L), and this was associated with significant reductions in 
cell number (Fig. S2 M). 
Thus, the GSC specificity of ZIKV 
is not a general property of related neurotropic flaviviruses.
ZIKV causes loss of self-renewal and proliferation 
in glioblastoma organoids
To test the specificity of ZIKV for GSCs in the context of 
the cellular heterogeneity that exists in patients, we used 
an in vitro human glioblastoma organoid model (Hubert 
et al., 2016). Three GSC models (387, 3565, and 4121) 
were used that form small organoids by 3 d (Fig. 2 A) and 
mature organoids within 3 wk (Fig. 2 B). Infection with 
ZIKV-Brazil or ZIKV-Dakar slowed organoid growth at 
2 wk (Fig. 2, C and D) and 4 wk (Fig. 2, E and F), re-
spectively, as assessed by organoid area (Fig. 2 G). ZIKV 
infected the glioblastoma organoids, with preference for 
cells expressing the GSC marker SOX2 (Fig. 2, H and I). 
Colocalization of ZIKV-infected cells and the apoptotic 
marker, AC3, confirmed that ZIKV induced tumor cell 
death (Fig. 2, J and K). However, ZIKV did not efficiently 
infect the proliferating tumor cells, as marked by Ki-67 
(Fig. 2, L and M), or differentiated tumor cells (Fig. 2, N 
and O). ZIKV infection reduced undifferentiated GSCs in 
glioblastoma organoids, as shown by reduction in SOX2 
and Ki-67 staining, and increased apoptosis, which resulted 
in a relative increase in DGCs (marked by GFAP) com-
pared with the uninfected control (Fig. 2 P).
In human tissue specimens, ZIKV targets GScs, with fewer 
effects on dGcs and normal neural cells
To confirm these results in the absence of culture, we col-
lected glioblastoma specimens (Fig. 3, A–C) immediately 
after surgical resection and inoculated them with the two 
ZIKV strains. Over a 1-wk period, ZIKV progressively in-
fected the tumors (Fig. 3, D–S; and Fig. S2 N). Costaining 
of sections revealed that the majority of ZIKV-infected 
cells expressed SOX2 (Fig. 3, D, G, J, M, P
, and S). Un-
like in organoids in patient specimens, which have differ-
ent growth dynamics, ZIKV did infect proliferating cells 
(Fig. 3, E, H, K, N, Q, and S) but still rarely infected DGCs 
(Fig. 3, F
, I, L, O, R, and S). These results support the hy-
pothesis that ZIKV preferentially targets and kills GSCs.
To test the effects of ZIKV on normal adult human 
neural cells, we inoculated nonmalignant neural tissues 
from adult epilepsy specimens (Fig. 3, T–V). ZIKV did 
not infect normal adult human brain tissues, including 
NeuN+ neurons (Fig. 3, W and Y) and GFAP+ glial cells 
(Fig. 3, X and Z), as limited viral replication was de-
tected compared with glioblastomas (Fig. S2, N and O). 
In addition, compared with GSCs and DGCs, the human 
brain neural cell cultures that were derived from epi-
lepsy patients (NM55 and NM177) or from differenti-
ated human neural stem cells (Hu-DNCs) demonstrated 
limited ZIKV infection (Fig. S2, P–U). Limited toxicity 
in these neural cell models was confirmed using a cell 
viability assay over a 1-wk time course with two ZIKV 
strains (Fig. S2 
V), and ZIKV replicated poorly in normal 
neural cells (Fig. S2, W and X).

ZIKV attenuates glioma growth, prolongs survival, and has 
marginal effects on normal neural cells
We recapitulated relevant conditions for human brain tumor 
therapy using mice. As mice are not natural hosts for ZIKV
, 
pathogenesis studies have used animals with acquired or 
genetic deficiencies of type I IFN signaling (Lazear et al., 
2016). T
o overcome this limitation, we used a mouse-adapted 
ZIKV-Dakar that had gained virulence through passage in a 
Rag1−/− host (Govero et al., 2016; Sapparapu et al., 2016). 
We 
first compared the efficacy of the parental and mouse-adapted 
ZIKV-Dakar strains against three mouse glioma models de-
veloped in the C57BL/6 background (GL261, GL26, and 
CT-2A; Wang et al., 2017) and two mouse CNS lines (BV2 
and mouse-differentiated neural cells [MS-DNCs]) in vitro 
(Fig. 4, A and B). The mouse-adapted ZIKV-Dakar strain at-
tenuated the growth of the mouse glioma cells, whereas the 
parental ZIKV strain was less effective (Fig. 4 A). In contrast, 
neither the parental nor the mouse-adapted ZIKV-Dakar 
inhibited the growth of other mouse CNS cells (BV2 and 
MS-DNCs; Fig. 4 A). These results were confirmed by virus 
titration at 1 wk with mouse glioma cells (GL26, GL261, and 
CT-2A) but not with BV2 cells and MS-DNCs (Fig. 4 B).
T
o assess the oncolytic effects of ZIKV in vivo, we gen-
erated mouse gliomas from two different mouse cell lines 
(GL261 and CT-2A) grown in syngeneic hosts. Glioma cells 
were transduced with a luciferase reporter and permitted 
to form tumors, which were validated by bioluminescence 
imaging and histopathology (Fig. 4, C–E). Mice with tu-
mors were randomized into two groups and treated 2 wk 
after implantation with either PBS control or mouse-adapted 
ZIKV-Dakar (103 focus-forming units [FFU]). Histological 
examination at 1 wk after tumor treatment demonstrated that 
the ZIKV-treated tumors were smaller in size compared with 
PBS-treated tumors (Fig. 4, F–I). Notably, ZIKV infection 
extended the life spans of tumor-bearing mice (Fig. 4 J). T
o 
test whether tumor-bearing mice could benefit from a higher 
dose of virus, we inoculated 105 FFU of the mouse-adapted 
ZIKV-Dakar at 1 wk after implantation with the GL261 
model. The survival time of tumor-bearing mice was greater 
compared with that of the control or the 103-FFU dose 
(Fig. 4 K). T
o determine the specificity of cell targeting, we 
stained for ZIKV antigen and markers of stem cell prolifera-
tion and differentiation (Fig. 4, L–T). ZIKV infected ∼6% of 
glioma cells at the endpoint (Fig. 4 T), with the majority of 
these cells expressing the precursor marker SOX2 (Fig. 4, L, 
M, and T). In contrast, GFAP+ tumor cells were less infected 
(Fig. 4, N and O). Effects on proliferating cell populations 
were measured by Ki-67 staining and BrdU treatment and 
staining. 
The majority of ZIKV+ cells were negative for Ki-67 
(>70%; Fig. 4, P
, Q, and T) or BrdU (>80%; Fig. 4, R–T). 
These results support the efficacy of ZIKV in vivo against 
nonproliferating, stem-like cells (Li et al., 2016; Qian et al., 
2016). 2 wk after treatment, viral RNA remained localized to 
the tumor, and ZIKV-treated tumors had extensive cell death 
as assessed by caspase-3 staining (Fig. 4 U).
IFn signaling is one determinant of differential 
sensitivity of GScs to ZIKV
Although the mechanism by which ZIKV preferentially tar-
gets GSCs for infection and killing remains unknown, GSCs 
can suppress antitumor immune responses (Sarkar et al., 2014; 
Alvarado et al., 2017). T
o address the possible target speci-
ficity of ZIKV
, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) 
comparing uninfected GSCs and DGCs and defined a group 
of differentially expressed immune genes, including type I 
IFN–stimulated genes (ISGs; Fig. S3). Gene set enrichment 
analysis revealed that many ISGs were up-regulated in DGCs 
(Fig. S3, A and B). T
o further elucidate the signaling path-
ways that regulate ZIKV targeting of GSCs, we infected three 
GSC models (387, 3565, and 4121) with the ZIKV-Dakar 
strain for 36–48 h and then performed RNA-seq. IFN sig-
naling was the top gene ontology pathway activated by ZIKV 
infection (Fig. S3, C and D). The RNA-seq data were vali-
dated by qPCR (Fig. S3 E). As ZIKV cannot fully antago-
nize ISGs, IFN responses may contribute to the specificity 
of ZIKV inhibition of GSC growth but more limited killing 
of DGCs or normal brain neurons and glial cells. Consis-
tent with this hypothesis, treatment of DGCs with a blocking 
antibody against IFN-α/β receptor 2 (IFN 
AR2) resulted in 
increased ZIKV infection (Fig. S3 F) and decreased relative 
cell number (Fig. S3 G).
an attenuated ZIKV maintains effectiveness against GScs 
and has additive effects with temozolomide chemotherapy
We previously reported a mutation of the flavivirus NS5 gene 
(E218A) that sensitizes the virus to translational inhibition by 
type I IFN and IFIT1 (Daffis et al., 2010) resulting in attenu-
ation in cells responsive to type I IFNs. T

Cambodia 2010; Shan et al., 2016) and its recombinant deriv-
ative ZIKV-E218A against three GSC models (Fig. 5). Both 
the parental and E218A mutant ZIKV strains displayed an-
ti-GSC activity, as measured by cell viability and sphere for-
mation (Fig. 5, A and B). Although the parental ZIKV strain 
was more potent in reducing GSC growth, both strains were 
effective. Both the parental strain and the E218A-attenuated 
strain preferentially infected SOX2+ tumor cells and induced 
apoptosis (Fig. 5, C–H). Although tumor cells have the po-
tential to activate the IFN response pathway, we still ob-
served significant death of GSCs treated with ZIKV-E218A. 
As GSCs often display resistance to chemotherapy, including 
the standard-of-care temozolomide (TMZ; Stupp et al., 2009; 
Chen et al., 2012), we evaluated the combinatorial efficacy 
of TMZ and ZIKV E218A. Whereas TMZ alone had limited 
effects on GSCs, ZIKV-E218A combined with TMZ for 1 
wk showed greater antitumor efficacy (Fig. 5, A and B) and 
induction of apoptosis (Fig. 5, G–I). We tested ZIKV-E218A 
infection capacity over a 1-wk time course. ZIKV-E218A had 
self-limited replication capacity in three GSC models (387, 
3565, and 4121) relative to that of the parental ZIKV strain 
(Fig. 5 J). These data suggest that engineered mutant ZIKV 
strains may promote infection and lysis of GSCs with less 
toxicity to surrounding differentiated neural cells.
engineering of ZIKV may provide a 
therapeutic modality against GScs
Our findings suggest that because of its tropism for neuropro-
genitor cells, ZIKV may offer a tailored therapy that could be 
used in combination with conventional therapies (e.g., cyto-
toxic chemotherapy) that target bulk tumor cell populations. 
The reason for its tropism for specific cells is uncertain, as no 
definitive ZIKV receptor has been established. Our study is a 
first step in the development of engineered ZIKV as a glio-
blastoma therapy. Safety remains a paramount concern. The 
E218A mutant virus has two nucleotide changes in the same 
codon that abrogate the 2'-O methyltransferase activity in the 
NS5 protein (Zhou et al., 2007) and attenuates its replication 
in cells responsive to type I IFNs (Daffis et al., 2010). Re-
gression to pathogenic virus requires a low-probability event 
of concurrent nucleotide changes causing the exact amino 
acid reversion. Notwithstanding this, the E218A mutant virus 
represents a framework for further genetic modification to 
ensure safety and maintain efficacy. For example, second-site 
mutations in the 3′ untranslated region that affect produc-
tion of a subgenomic RNA (Akiyama et al., 2016; Donald 
et al., 2016) could further sensitize the virus to type I IFN. 
Public health concerns must be addressed with additional 
preclinical testing, including assays that evaluate for dissem-
ination and genetic reversion.
Although we observed significant effects on mouse 
high-grade glioma models in vivo and on patient-derived 
GSCs in vitro, it remains to be determined how ZIKV 
strains perform in patient-derived GSCs in vivo. This will 
require overcoming the technical challenges of creating pa-
tient-derived tumor models in more immunocompetent 
mice. We envision possible therapeutic use of modified ZIKV 
strains to target GSCs through orthotopic injection into the 
tumor beds of patients. Other modified viruses are under 
development to treat glioblastoma, including measles (Bach 
et al., 2013; Hardcastle et al., 2017), polio (Dobrikova et al., 
2008), and herpes viruses (Cheema et al., 2013). Our work 
serves as a foundation for further mechanistic studies and the 
genetic engineering of a safe and effective ZIKV
, which could 
become an important tool in neuro-oncology.

(Thermo Fisher), 2 mM l-glutamine (Thermo Fisher), 1 mM 
sodium pyruvate (Thermo Fisher), 10 ng/ml basic fibroblast 
growth factor (bFGF), and 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor 
(EGF; R&D Systems). The GSC phenotype was validated by 
Olig2 and Sox2 expression, functional assays of self-renewal 
(serial neurosphere passage), and tumor propagation using in 
vivo limiting dilution.
Proliferation and sphere formation assay
Cell viability was measured using CellTiter-Glo (Promega). 
After addition of ZIKV
, all data were normalized to day 0 and 
expressed as a relative cell number. Neurosphere formation 
was measured as previously described (Wang et al., 2017). In 
brief, GSCs (1,000 cells) were plated into 96-well plates. The 
presence and number of neurospheres in each well were re-
corded on days 0, 3, 5, and 7.
ZIKV strains
ZIKV Dakar 41519 strain (Senegal 1984) and Brazil (Para-
iba 2015) were provided by the World Reference Center 
for Emerging Viruses and Arboviruses (University of T
exas 
Medical Branch) and S. Whitehead (NIH, Bethesda, MD). 
Parental and ZIKV-E218A (mutation in NS5 gene) were 
generated from an infectious cDNA clone of the Cambodian 
strain FSS13025 (2010) using site-directed mutagenesis as de-
scribed previously (Shan et al., 2016). This Cambodian strain 
of ZIKV was chosen for mutagenesis, as opposed to the Dakar 
strain, because of the availability of an infectious cDNA clone 
(Shan et al., 2016). ZIKV stocks were propagated in 
Vero cells 
after inoculating at an MOI of 0.01 and incubating for 72 h. 
Viral titers were quantified by plaque assay as described pre-
viously (Govero et al., 2016), and stocks were stored at −80°C 
in single-use aliquots. ZIKV strain Dakar 41519 was passaged 
four times in Rag1−/− mice to create a mouse-adapted, more 
pathogenic variant of ZIKV-Dakar (Govero et al., 2016; Sap-
parapu et al., 2016). This variant has a single mutation in the 
NS4B gene that is associated with increased infectivity.
cells
Vero (African green monkey kidney epithelial, ATC 
CCCL-
81) cells, BV2 cells (microglia), GL261 (mouse glioma), GL26 
(mouse glioma; a gift from M. Castro, University of Michigan, 
Ann Arbor, MI), CT2A (Oh et al., 2014; mouse glioma; a 
gift from T. Seyfried, Boston College, Boston, MA), NM55 
and NM177 nonmalignant epilepsy cultures, or DGCs were 
maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS (Atlas). 
MS-DNCs were generated by isolating cells from the lateral 
ventricles of 4–6-wk-old C57BL/6 mice and placing them in 
DMEM with 10% FBS. For animal studies, GL261 and CT2A 
cells were virally transduced with a luciferase construct and 
selected with puromycin (1 µg/ml). GSCs, epilepsy tissues, 
and glioblastoma tissues were maintained in Neurobasal com-
plete media. All cells were incubated at 37°C in humidified 
incubators supplemented with 5% CO2. All cell lines were 
negative for mycoplasma.
In vitro viral infection and drug treatment experiments
GSCs were plated at 1,000 cells/well in 96-well tissue cul-
ture treated plates (TPP) and allowed to attach overnight. For 
viral infection and growth inhibition assays, wild-type ZIKV- 
Dakar, ZIKV-Brazil, or mouse-adapted ZIKV-Dakar were 
used at an MOI of 5. For combined drug and virus therapy 
experiments, the wild-type parental ZIKV-Cambodia and 
its derivative ZIKV-E218A were used for infection. TMZ 
 
(Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in PBS and diluted in Neuro-
basal complete media. ZIKV was added at an MOI of 5 by itself 
or 4 h before TMZ (250 µM) addition. Cell supernatants were 
stored at −80°C for subsequent analysis. For IFN 
AR antibody 
blockade experiments, DGCs were treated with 20 µg/ml 
 
of anti–human IFN 
AR2 neutralizing monoclonal antibody 
(clone MMH 
AR-2; 21385-1; PBL Assay Science) for 12 h be-
fore the addition of indicated ZIKV strains at an MOI of 5.
Infectious virus titration
Focus-forming assays (FFAs) were performed with Vero cells 
as described previously (Govero et al., 2016). Supernatant 
samples containing ZIKV were serially diluted and added to 
Vero cell monolayers in 96-well plates. The virus was allowed 
to infect for 2–4 h, and then 100 µl of a 1:1 solution of 2× 
DMEM with 8% FBS and 2% methylcellulose was added to 
cells. Plates were incubated for 48 h and then fixed by the ad-
dition of 2% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Cells were then incu-
bated with 500 ng/ml of the flavivirus cross-reactive mouse 
monoclonal antibody E60 (Oliphant et al., 2006) for 2 h at 
room temperature. After incubation for 1 h with a 1:5,000 
dilution of horseradish peroxidase (HRP)–conjugated goat 
anti–mouse IgG (Sigma-Aldrich), foci were detected by addi-
tion of TrueBlue substrate (KPL). Foci were analyzed with a 
CTL Immunospot instrument.
histology
5-µm-thick sections of paraffin-embedded tissues were an-
alyzed for hematoxylin and eosin (H&E; Thermo Fisher), 
Picro-Sirius Red (Sigma-Aldrich), and Masson’s Trichrome 
(Diagnostic Biosystems) according to the manufacturer’s 
 
instructions. 4×, 10×, and 20× images were captured on an 
Eclipse 80i brightfield microscope (Nikon). Image analysis was 
performed by thresholding for positive staining and normal-
izing to total tissue area using ImageJ (NIH) and MetaMorph 
v7.7.0.0 (Molecular Devices) software (Jiang et al., 2016).

Immunofluorescence staining and microscopy
8-µm-thick cryosections were air dried and fixed in 4% 
PFA for 15 min before being washed twice with PBS. Tis-
sues were permeabilized by incubating the slides with 1% 
Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min at room temperature and 
peroxidase quenched by incubating them in 1% H2O2 (In-
vitrogen) for 10 min at room temperature. After block-
ing for 1 h at room temperature in blocking buffer (5% 
goat serum, 2.5% BSA in 1× PBS), slides were incubated 
overnight in a humidified chamber at 4°C with primary 
antibodies ZIKV (Millipore; AB10216; working dilution 
1:1,000), Sox2 (Millipore; AB5603; stock: 1 mg/ml; work-
ing dilution 1:400), Ki-67 (Millipore; AB9620; working 
dilution 1:400), GFAP (Sigma-Aldrich; G9269; working 
dilution 1:1,000), PAX6 (Abcam; AB5790; stock: 1 mg/
ml; working dilution 1:200), NeuN (Abcam; AB177487; 
working dilution 1:500), Stat1 (Abcam; AB31369; stock: 
1 mg/ml; working dilution 1:1,000), BrdU (Abcam; 
AB6326; stock: 1 mg/ml; working dilution 1:1,000), and 
Ifnar1 (Sino Biological; 50469; stock: 1 mg/ml; working 
dilution 1:1,000). After PBST (1× PBS with 0.05% Tween 
20) washes, slides were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488–, 
594–, or 647–conjugated anti–mouse, anti–rat, or anti–
rabbit secondary antibodies (Thermo Fisher). Slides were 
subsequently washed and mounted using VEC 
TAS 
HIE 
LD 
with DAPI (Vector Labs). For cell immunofluorescence 
staining, 105 cells were seeded into a 12-well chamber slide 
(Thermo Fisher) and cultured overnight. Slides were then 
processed as described previously for tissue staining. 10×, 
20×, and 40× images were collected at room tempera-
ture on an Eclipse 80i epifluorescence microscope (Nikon; 
Jiang et al., 2016). 
The cells were identified based on DAPI. 
Image analysis was performed by thresholding for positive 
staining and normalizing to total tissue area using ImageJ 
and MetaMorph v7.7.0.0 software. Quantitation was ini-
tially performed in an unblinded manner. However, many 
of the key results were requantitated by a second individual 
in a blinded manner to eliminate bias.
Immunohistochemistry
Tissues were fixed in 10% formalin, embedded in paraffin, and 
incubated with antibodies as previously described (Jiang et al., 
2016). In brief, 6-µm-thick sections were deparaffinized in xy-
lene, rehydrated in graded ethanol, and subjected to antigen 
retrieval by steam heating in Citra antigen retrieval solution (Bio-
Genex). After blocking for 1 h at room temperature in blocking 
buffer (5% goat serum, 2.5% BSA in 1× PBS), slides were incu-
bated overnight in a humidified chamber at 4°C with primary 
antibodies Ki-67 (Millipore; AB9620; working dilution 1:400), 
GFAP (Sigma-Aldrich; G9269; working dilution 1:1,000), and 
cleaved caspase-3 (Cell Signaling; 9661; working dilution 1:100). 
Slides were then incubated at room temperature for 30 min with 
anti–rabbit (EnVision+ System HRP Labeled Polymer; Dako) 
or anti–mouse (VEC 
TAS 
TAIN ABC Rabbit IgG detection kit; 
Vector Laboratories) secondary antibodies. Staining was detected 
using 3,3-diaminobenzidine (DAB). Image acquisition and anal-
ysis were similar to those of immunofluorescence imaging.
RNA in situ hybridization (ISH) was performed using 
RNAscope 2.5 HD (Brown; 
Advanced Cell Diagnostics) accord-
ing to the manufacturer’s instructions and as previously described 
(Govero et al., 2016). PFA-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sec-
tions (from ZIKV-infected or uninfected tumors) were deparaf-
finized by incubating them for 60 min at 60°C, and endogenous 
peroxidases were quenched with H2O2 for 10 min at room tem-
perature. Slides were then boiled for 15 min in RNAscope Tar-
get Retrieval reagents and incubated for 30 min in RNAscope 
Protease Plus reagent before ZIKV RNA probe (Advanced Cell 
Diagnostics; 467771). Sections were counterstained with Gill’s 
hematoxylin and visualized by brightfield microscopy.
organoids
Organoids were formed by suspending tumor cells in Matri-
gel and forming 20-ml pearls on Parafilm molds before cul-
ture (Hubert et al., 2016). Organoids were cultured in 6-well 
or 10-cm plates, shaking in Neurobasal complete media. Im-
ages of growing organoids were acquired using an EVOS FL 
Cell Imaging System (Invitrogen) for microscopic imaging.

Organoids were grown until 35 d under these conditions. Or-
ganoids were infected with ZIKV-Dakar or ZIKV-Brazil at 
106 FFU for 2 h, and then the media was removed. Organoids 
were subsequently washed three times with PBS, and fresh 
Neurobasal complete media was added. Images were acquired 
using EVOS Cell Imaging System 3 (Thermo Fisher). Areas 
of individual organoids were measured with ImageJ software.
animal experiments
Mice and tumor implantation. 
 Mouse glioblastoma cells 
(GL261 and CT2A) transduced with luciferase were grown 
in DMEM supplemented with 10% serum. Cells were har-
vested by trypsinization and then washed and resuspended in 
PBS. A total of 2 × 104 cells were implanted into 6-wk-old 
C57BL/6 female mice (Jackson Laboratory). In brief, animals 
were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine 
(10 mg/kg) and xylazine (100 mg/kg). The animals were 
placed in a stereotactic apparatus (Stoelting), and an incision 
was made over the cranial midline. A burr hole was made 1.5 
mm anterior to the lambda and 2.5 mm right of the midline. 
A 29.5-gauge Hamilton syringe was inserted to a depth of 
 
3 mm and withdrawn 0.5 mm to a depth of 2.5 mm. 3 µl of 
GL261 or CT-2A-luc2 cells were injected over the course of 
5 min. The incision site was closed by 
Vetbond (3M).
treatment and animal monitoring. 
 1 (GL261) or 2 wk 
(GL261 or CT2A) after tumor implantation, animals were 
placed into two groups for mouse-adapted ZIKV-Dakar 
inoculation or saline injection. 
There was no formal animal 
randomization process; animals were taken from serial 
cages and treated with the control or virus. 103 or 105 FFU 
of the mouse-adapted ZIKV-Dakar was diluted in 10-µl 
volume. The same coordinates from surgery were used for 
this treatment. Animals were monitored daily for signs of 
neurological impairment. The monitor was not blinded to 
the treatment received.
Flow cytometry
At different time points after ZIKV infection, cells were fixed 
with 2% PFA diluted in PBS for 10 min at room tempera-
ture and permeabilized with HBSS buffer (10 mM Hepes), 
0.1% (wt/vol) saponin (Sigma-Aldrich), and 0.025% NaN3 
for 10 min at room temperature. GSCs were transferred to 
 
a 
V-bottom plate (Costar) and incubated for 1 h at 4°C with 
2 µg/ml of ZV-64 mAb (Zhao et al., 2016). After washing, 
cells were incubated with an Alexa Fluor 647–conjugated 
goat anti–mouse IgG (Invitrogen) for 30 min at 4°C, washed 
twice with HBSS buffer, processed on a FACS Array (BD 
Biosciences), and analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star).
Bioluminescence imaging
Beginning 1 wk after tumor cell implantation, brain tumor 
formation was detected using bioluminescence imaging. 
Mice, under isoflurane anesthesia (2% vaporized in O2), 
were injected intraperitoneally with d-luciferin (150 mg/kg 
in PBS; Gold Biotechnology) and imaged using an IVIS50 
imaging system (PerkinElmer). Exposure times were 10 or 
60 s, and software-defined contour regions of interest were 
used to measure total photon flux (photons/s) using Living 
Image 2.6 (PerkinElmer).
Quantitative rt-Pcr (qrt-Pcr) for ZIKV rna
ZIKV RNA levels were determined by one-step qRT
-PCR 
(Thermo Fisher) on an ABI 7500 Fast Instrument (Applied 
Biolsystems) using standard cycling conditions. Viral burden 
was expressed on a log10 scale as viral RNA equivalents per 
g after comparison with a standard curve produced using se-
rial 10-fold dilutions of ZIKV RNA. For ZIKV

rna-seq data acquisition, quality control, and processing
RNA was obtained from GSCs infected with ZIKV-Dakar for 
36–48 h. T
otal cellular RNA was isolated using the RNeasy 
kit (Qiagen). RNA-seq reads were aligned to the Ensembl 
release 76 assembly with STAR v. 2.5.1a. Gene counts were 
derived from the number of uniquely aligned unambiguous 
reads by Subread 
:feature Count v. 1.4.6p5. Transcript counts 
were produced by Sailfish v. 0.6.3. Sequencing performance 
was assessed for total number of aligned reads, total number 
of uniquely aligned reads, genes and transcripts detected, 
ribosomal fraction, known junction saturation, and read 
distribution over known gene models with RSeQC v. 2.6.2.
 2855
JEM Vol. 214, No. 10
All gene-level and transcript counts were imported into 
the R/Bioconductor package EdgeR, and TMM normaliza-
tion size factors were calculated to adjust for samples for dif-
ferences in library size. Genes or transcripts not expressed in 
any sample were excluded from further analysis. The TMM 
size factors and the matrix of counts were imported into 
R/Bioconductor package Limma, and weighted likelihoods 
based on the observed mean–variance relationship of every 
gene/transcript were calculated for all samples with the 
Voom 
function. Performance of the samples was assessed with a 
Spearman correlation matrix and multidimensional scaling 
plots. Gene/transcript performance was assessed with plots 
of residual standard deviation of every gene to their mean log 
count with a robustly fitted trend line of the residuals. Gen-
eralized linear models were created to test for gene- or tran-
script-level differential expression. Differentially expressed 
genes and transcripts were then filtered for FDR-adjusted P 
values less than or equal to 0.05.
T
o enhance the biological interpretation of the large set 
of transcripts, grouping of genes/transcripts based on func-
tional similarity was achieved using the R/Bioconductor 
packages GAGE and Pathview. GAGE and Pathview were 
also used to generate pathway maps on known signaling and 
metabolism pathways curated by KEGG.
For the matched GSC and DGC lines, RNA-seq data 
were evaluated for type I and II IFN signatures between 
GSCs and DGCs using gene set enrichment analysis and 
were validated using RNA-seq data on additional matched 
cell lines derived from Suvà et al. (2014). IFN signatures were 
derived from the Molecular Signature Database curated by 
the Broad Institute (Subramanian et al., 2005; http 
://www 
.broad 
.mit 
.edu 
/gsea 
/). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering 
was performed using FPKM values from matched TPC and 
DGC lines. All RNA-seq data are available through the Gene 
Expression Omnibus (GEO) data repository under accession 
nos. GSE102244 and GSE102924.
Statistical analysis
All statistical analysis was performed using Prism 7.0 software 
(GraphPad). 
The number of animals and replicate experiments 
is specified in each figure legend. No statistical methods were 
used to predetermine sample sizes, but our choice of sample 
sizes is similar to those reported in previous publications (Jiang 
et al., 2016; 
Wang et al., 2017). All animals that survived tumor 
implantation and virus injection surgeries were included in 
the analyses. All grouped data were presented as mean ± SD 
or SEM as indicated in the figure legends. Student’s t tests, 
one-way ANO 
VA with multiple comparison correction, and 
two-way ANO 
VA with multiple comparison correction were 
used to assess the significance of differences between groups. 
These tests were performed when the sample size was large 
enough to assume that the means were normally distrib-
uted or that the distribution of residuals was normal, respec-
tively. For groups being statistically compared, variances in 
data were similar. For animal survival analysis, Kaplan–Meier 
curves were generated and the log-rank test was performed to 
assess statistical significance between groups.

compared with GSCs and DGCs. Fig. S3 demonstrates that 
IFN signaling is one determinant of the differential effects of 
ZIKV on GSCs compared with DGCs.
