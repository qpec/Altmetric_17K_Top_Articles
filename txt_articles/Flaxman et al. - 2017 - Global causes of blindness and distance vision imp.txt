Summary
Background Contemporary data for causes of vision impairment and blindness form an important basis of recommendations 
in public health policies. Refreshment of the Global Vision Database with recently published data sources permitted 
modelling of cause of vision loss data from 1990 to 2015, further disaggregation by cause, and forecasts to 2020.
Methods In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we analysed published and unpublished population-based 
data for the causes of vision impairment and blindness from 1980 to 2014. We identified population-based studies 
published before July 8, 2014, by searching online databases with no language restrictions (MEDLINE from 
Jan 1, 1946, and Embase from Jan 1, 1974, and the WHO Library Database). We fitted a series of regression models 
to estimate the proportion of moderate or severe vision impairment (defined as presenting visual acuity of <6/18 
but ≥3/60 in the better eye) and blindness (presenting visual acuity of <3/60 in the better eye) by cause, age, 
region, and year. 
Findings We identified 288 studies of 3 983 541 participants contributing data from 98 countries. Among the global 
population with moderate or severe vision impairment in 2015 (216·6 million [80% uncertainty interval 98·5 million 
to 359·1 million]), the leading causes were uncorrected refractive error (116·3 million [49·4 million to 202·1 million]), 
cataract (52·6 million [18·2 million to 109·6 million]), age-related macular degeneration (8·4 million [0·9 million 
to 29·5 million]), glaucoma (4·0 million [0·6 million to 13·3 million]), and diabetic retinopathy (2·6 million 
[0·2 million to 9·9 million]). Among the global population who were blind in 2015 (36·0 million [12·9 million to 
65·4 million]), the leading causes were cataract (12·6 million [3·4 million to 28·7 million]), uncorrected refractive 
error (7·4 million [2·4 million to 14·8 million]), and glaucoma (2·9 million [0·4 million to 9·9 million]). By 2020, 
among the global population with moderate or severe vision impairment (237·1 million [101·5 million to 
399·0 million]), the number of people affected by uncorrected refractive error is anticipated to rise to 127·7 million 
(51·0 million to 225·3 million), by cataract to 57·1 million (17·9 million to 124·1 million), by age-related macular 
degeneration to 8·8 million (0·8 million to 32·1 million), by glaucoma to 4·5 million (0·5 million to 15·4 million), 
and by diabetic retinopathy to 3·2 million (0·2 million to 12·9 million). By 2020, among the global population who 
are blind (38·5 million [13·2 million to 70·9 million]), the number of patients blind because of cataract is anticipated 
to rise to 13·4 million (3·3 million to 31·6 million), because of uncorrected refractive error to 8·0 million 
(2·5 million to 16·3 million), and because of glaucoma to 3·2 million (0·4 million to 11·0 million). Cataract and 
uncorrected refractive error combined contributed to 55% of blindness and 77% of vision impairment in adults 
aged 50 years and older in 2015. World regions varied markedly in the causes of blindness and vision impairment 
in this age group, with a low prevalence of cataract (<22% for blindness and 14·1–15·9% for vision impairment) 
and a high prevalence of age-related macular degeneration (>14% of blindness) as causes in the high-income 
subregions. Blindness and vision impairment at all ages in 2015 due to diabetic retinopathy (odds ratio 2·52 
[1·48–3·73]) and cataract (1·21 [1·17–1·25]) were more common among women than among men, whereas 
blindness and vision impairment due to glaucoma (0·71 [0·57–0·86]) and corneal opacity (0·54 [0·43–0·66]) were 
more common among men than among women, with no sex difference related to age-related macular degeneration 
(0·91 [0·70–1·14]). 
Interpretation The number of people affected by the common causes of vision loss has increased substantially as the 
population increases and ages. Preventable vision loss due to cataract (reversible with surgery) and refractive error 
(reversible with spectacle correction) continue to cause most cases of blindness and moderate or severe vision 
impairment in adults aged 50 years and older. A large scale-up of eye care provision to cope with the increasing 
numbers is needed to address avoidable vision loss.

rb@rupertbourne.co.uk Introduction
Contemporary and accurate data for the cause-specific 
prevalence of vision impairment and blindness are a 
fundamental basis of public health policies, such as 
allocation of resources and health service planning, and 
are important for prioritisation of scientific advances and 
industry research. The Vision Loss Expert Group reported 
estimates of vision impairment resulting from a 
systematic review of published literature and available 
unpublished data from population-based studies of the 
prevalence of blindness and vision impairment dating 
from 1980 to 2015,1 using a continuously updated 
database of population-based studies (the Global Vision 
Database; the Vision Atlas contains online maps created 
with data from the Global Vision Database). Unpublished 
data were principally those of rapid assessment methods, 
with some older reports held at WHO. Globally, 
36·0 million people were estimated to be blind in 2015, 
whereas 216·6 million people had moderate or severe 
vision impairment. Although a decrease occurred in the 
age-standardised prevalence of blindness and moderate 
or severe vision impairment between 1990 and 2015 (the 
global age-standardised all-age prevalence of blindness 
decreased from 0·75% [80% uncertainty interval 
(80% UI) 0·25–1·41] in 1990 to 0·48% [0·17–0·87] in 
2015), and the global age-standardised all-age prevalence 
of moderate or severe vision impairment decreased from 
3·83% (1·66–6·42) to 2·90% (1·31–4·80), the number of 
people vision impaired was little changed as a result of 
growth and ageing of the total population.
Since the Vision Loss Expert Group last published 
prevalence estimates of cause of moderate or severe vision 
impairment or blindness up to 2010,2 the systematic review 
has been extended to include the more recent population-
based data to derive cause-specific estimates. New data 
from additional studies allowed more precise estimates of 
emerging causes of blindness and moderate or severe 
vision impairment than previously. For example, a 
limitation of the previous meta-analysis of causes was the 
inability to disaggregate age-related macular degeneration 
from other causes of macular degeneration (eg, myopic 
macular degeneration or hereditary causes) and the 
absence of sufficient data to model corneal opacity, which is 
an important cause in low-income and middle-income 
countries.3,4 This study provides global estimates of the 
leading causes of vision impairment and blindness for 
2015, examines trends since 1990, and provides projections 
to 2020.

Research in context
Evidence before this study
Using data from studies published between 1980 and 2012, as 
well as unpublished studies, the Vision Loss Expert Group 
previously calculated estimates for global prevalence of causes 
of vision impairment and blindness for 2010. The proportions 
of vision impairment and blindness due to cataract and 
trachoma decreased over the study period of 20 years; those 
due to glaucoma, macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, 
and uncorrected refractive error increased.
Added value of this study
This study updates the estimates of the global and regional 
prevalence of causes of blindness and vision impairment. 
The new analysis of the Global Vision Database by the Vision 
Loss Expert Group incorporates 61 new studies from 
35 different countries and where available includes more 
precise disaggregated data supplied by study investigators than 
are available in their published outputs. This database contains 
data for both presenting and best-corrected visual acuity and 
causes of vision impairment from 3 983 541 participants 
examined in 288 population-based studies from a systematic 
review of the published literature and analysis of unpublished 
literature. Furthermore, it uses an improved statistical analysis 
and provides projections of blindness and vision impairment, 
by cause, to 2020. In 2015, cataract or uncorrected refractive 
error were responsible for 77% of the global vision impairment 
burden and 55% of the blindness burden in adults aged 50 years 
and older, both of which are completely treatable causes. 
Glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration, corneal opacity, 
diabetic retinopathy, and trachoma were less frequent causes of 
blindness and vision impairment than were cataract and 
uncorrected refractive error, some of which are also 
preventable. Crude global prevalence (all ages) of blindness and 
vision impairment of each cause decreased markedly between 
1990 and 2015, except for diabetic retinopathy, which 
increased. However, the number of people affected by blindness 
and vision impairment is increasing, which is attributable to 
population growth and ageing. The proportion with 
preventable or treatable blindness decreased from 81·7% in 
2010 to 81·2% in 2015 and is projected to decrease to 80·8% in 
2020. The predicted increase in the number of people with 
avoidable vision impairment (defined as vision impairment 
that could be either treated or prevented by known, 
cost-effective means) to 2020 is mainly driven by south Asia 
and east Asia.
Implications of all the available evidence
This projection to 2020 of numbers of people affected by 
blindness and vision impairment indicates a continued increase 
in the need for care. Given this evidence, urgent action is called 
for to address this largely preventable global problem and 
provide adequate eye care services.

published before July 8, 2014, by searching online 
databases with no language restrictions (MEDLINE 
from Jan 1, 1946, and Embase from Jan 1, 1974, and the 
WHO Library Database). A full list of data sources for 
each cause and the number of studies reporting each 
pair of causes are given in the appendix. We extracted 
data from published reports. Unpublished data were 
principally those of rapid assessments. The methods for 
the data search including search terms and search 
strategy have been published in detail.1
Data analysis
Our analysis proceeded as follows: data identification 
and access, statistical estimation of the proportion of 
blindness or moderate or severe vision impairment for 
each cause separately by age and region, and application 
of this estimation to the overall blindness and moderate 
or severe vision impairment prevalence. We estimated 
causes of vision impairment over time by age and 
geographical region, using the 21 Global Burden of 
Disease regions (appendix). We estimated the prevalence 
of moderate or severe vision impairment (defined as 
presenting visual acuity of <6/18 but ≥3/60 in the better 
eye) and blindness (presenting visual acuity of <3/60 in 
the better eye)  attributable to cataract, glaucoma, age-
related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, 
corneal opacity, trachoma, uncorrected refractive error, 
and other causes for 1990–2015 (projected in 2015), and 
made projections to 2020. Descriptions of the causes are 
given in the panel.
Details of our Bayesian hierarchical modelling 
approach, the Stan modelling code, and the covariates 
used for each model are given in the appendix. We 
fitted six separate mixed-effects models for the 
following causes: cataract, glaucoma, age-related 
macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, corneal 
opacity, and other. The models include terms adjusting 
for age, sex, best-corrected versus presenting vision, 
urban, and whether or not the study was nationally 
representative.
We fitted the model for the vision impairment cause 
that we term “other” to data extracted from surveys 
reporting cataract and age-related macular degeneration 
and based it on the number of respondents with 
blindness or moderate or severe vision impairment who 
were reported as having unspecified causes of vision 
impairment. Unlike the other models, the models that 
we fitted for these data had no year trend. Our concern 
was that addition of a year covariate would have 
confounded a true change over time with a systematic 
change in how surveys reported a non-cause-specific 
category—eg, a tendency towards more detailed reporting 
on the causes of vision impairment and blindness in 
more recent surveys than in older surveys.
We derived estimates of uncorrected refractive error 
from the vision prevalence model published separately,1 
in which we explicitly modelled the contribution of 
uncorrected refractive error to blindness and vision 
impairment. This analysis used the same database as in 
this study, and the analysis was able to include all studies 
from the database (even studies for which estimates of 
only either best-corrected or presenting were reported) to 
estimate uncorrected refractive error. Because of data 
availability issues for blindness and vision impairment 
from trachoma, we used previously published estimates 
of trachoma-attributable blindness and moderate or 
severe vision impairment.2,5 To combine the separate 
causal estimates, we used the overall prevalence 
estimates at the region level by year as an envelope. We 
left the uncorrected refractive error estimates fixed and 
then apportioned the remaining prevalence to the various 
causes, normalising so that these causes fitted within the 
envelope by dividing each cause by the sum of the causes.
We fitted this statistical model for the six causes with 
fully Bayesian inference through Markov Chain Monte 
Carlo sampling implemented in the probabilistic 
programming language Stan version 2.15.1. With data 
sparsity across countries and over time, a hierarchical 
Bayesian model allowed us to borrow strength within 
regions and over time, better informing the estimates in 
a data-driven way than without this approach. Fully 
Bayesian inference meant that diagnosis of problems 
with the model was easier and uncertainty estimates had 
better calibration than without this approach. Diagnostic 
checks and statistical models used to predict the

proportion of vision impairment by cause are described 
in the appendix.
For each cause, we ran four parallel Markov Chain 
Monte Carlo chains, drawing 1000 samples each. After 
discarding 500 samples as burn-in from each chain, we 
obtained 2000 samples. We report means and tenth to 
90th percentiles as uncertainty intervals. We used 
regression models to combine raw survey data based on 
age and sex groups in various countries and years to 
produce estimates of attributable vision impairment by 
cause for each age-sex-country-year group. By combining 
these estimates with estimates of overall vision 
impairment 
by 
age-sex-country-year, 
we 
obtained 
prevalence estimates of each cause of vision loss. A 
straightforward aggregation of these estimates, weighting 
each age-sex group by its population in a given country-
year, yields crude population-level estimates of the 
prevalence of vision impairment by cause for each 
country and year. As these estimates are based on the age 
structure of a population, countries with older 
populations will typically have higher crude prevalence 
estimates. Thus, we also report age-standardised 
estimates of prevalence, wherein the aggregation is done 
with use of an artificial population structure, the WHO 
standard population,6 to enable comparability of 
population-level 
estimates 
of 
prevalence 
between 
countries with different age structures. By restricting the 
WHO standard population to individuals aged 50 years 
or older, we obtain age-standardised adult prevalence 
estimates.
By including a linear year term, the sign of this term 
indicates whether an increase or decrease occurs over 
time. In the Bayesian inference paradigm, we inferred a 
full posterior distribution over this term, so we can 
summarise it by asking what proportion of the time is it 
less than zero, indicating a decrease over time. This 
proportion is the posterior probability assigned by our 
model to a decreasing time trend.
We applied our model to forecast prevalence of 
blindness and moderate or severe vision impairment by 
cause into the future. Our model relies on health status 
and education as covariates and we extrapolated these 
covariates to the year 2020. As our model gives 
estimates of crude prevalence for country-years, we 
relied on the UN Population Division’s forecasts to 
2020 to derive crude numbers affected and age-
standardised prevalence.7 Thus, our estimates are also 
contingent on the assumptions regarding future 
fertility and mortality that underpin the UN Population 
Division estimates.

Results
Since the previous analysis of the Global Vision Database,2 
61 new studies were added from 35 different countries (of 
which 44 contributed disaggregated vision impairment 
prevalence data by cause and 28 involved rapid assessment 
of avoidable blindness survey methods), giving a total of 
288 studies of 3 983 541 participants contributing data 
from 98 countries (appendix). Among the global 
population who were blind in 2015 (36·0 million [80% UI 
12·9 million to 65·4 million), the leading causes of 
blindness (crude prevalence) among all ages were cataract, 
followed by uncorrected refractive error, glaucoma, age-
related macular degeneration, corneal opacity, trachoma, 
and diabetic retinopathy (appendix). Among the global 
population with moderate or severe vision impairment in 
2015 (216·6 million [98·5 million to 359·1 million]), the 
ranking was as follows: uncorrected refractive error, 
cataract, age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, 
corneal opacity, diabetic retinopathy, and trachoma 
(appendix).
The leading causes of blindness in those aged 50 years 
and older in 2015 were cataract followed by uncorrected 
refractive error and glaucoma (table 1, figure 1). Cataract 
and uncorrected refractive error combined contributed to 
55% of blindness and 77% of vision impairment in adults 
aged 50 years and older in 2015. Deconstructing these 
global averages, we observed large differences in the 
causes of blindness by region in this age group. In 2015, 
the proportion of blindness in those aged 50 years and 
older attributable to cataract ranged from <22% in high-
income subregions to more than 44% in southeast Asia 
and Oceania (table 1). The proportion of blindness 
attributable to glaucoma varied considerably from the 
lowest values in south Asia to a much higher proportion in 
southern sub-Saharan Africa. The proportion of blindness 
attributable to age-related macular degeneration was 
higher in regions with older populations, namely the high-
income subregions where more than 14% of blindness was 
attributed to age-related macular degeneration. By contrast, 
we observed the lowest proportion in the south Asia 
region. We observed no trachoma-related blindness in 13 
of the 21 world regions in 2015. Diabetic retinopathy 
contributed to only a small proportion of global blindness, 
with a profound inter-regional range. Although the data for 
contribution of corneal opacity to blindness should be 
interpreted with caution, our model estimated that 3·2% 
(80% UI 0·5–7·2) of global blindness could be attributed 
to this cause (all ages 3·5% [0·5–7·8; appendix).
Globally in 2015, the leading causes of moderate or 
severe vision impairment in those aged 50 years and older 
were uncorrected refractive error followed by cataract and 
age-related macular degeneration (table 2, figure 2). 
Uncorrected refractive error contributed to a larger 
proportion of vision impairment in south Asia than in 
other regions. As with blindness, the proportion of vision 
impairment attributed to cataract in those aged 50 years 
and older was smallest in high-income subregions 
(ranging from 14% to 16%) and greater than 30% in the 
central, eastern, and western regions of sub-Saharan 
Africa (ranging from 32% to 34%), Oceania, southeast 
Asia, and east Asia. The proportion of vision impairment 
attributable to age-related macular degen 
eration was 
small in comparison, yet considerable regional variation 
existed, with low proportions in south Asia, but 
proportions exceeding 9% in the high-income subregions, 
central and eastern Europe, and central Asia, which have 
predominantly white populations. Glaucoma, diabetic 
retinopathy, corneal opacity, and trachoma each accounted 
for <3% of vision impairment worldwide. A regional 
breakdown of the proportion of blindness and vision 
impairment by cause in 2015 for all ages is given in the 
appendix. In 2010, 2·5% (80% UI 1·0–4·6) of the world’s 
population was estimated to be blind or vision impaired 
due to uncorrected refractive error and cataract. By 2020, 
we estimate that this proportion will be 2·7% (1·0–5·1). 
We observed sex differences by cause in the attributable 
fraction for both blindness and vision impairment when 
considering all ages in 2015. As our statistical model 
contains a term for sex, we were able to derive posterior 
estimates of the relative odds ratio for women versus 
men. Cataract, uncorrected refractive error, and diabetic 
retinopathy were more common causes of blindness and 
vision impairment in women than in men, with relative 
odds ratio of women versus men of 1·21 (80% UI 
1·17–1·25) for cataract, 1·07 (1·03–1·11) for uncorrected 
refractive error, and 2·52 (1·48–3·73) for diabetic 
retinopathy. Whereas men were more likely to be blind 
or have vision impairment due to glaucoma (0·71 
[0·57–0·86]) or corneal opacity (0·54 [0·43–0·66]) than 
were women, for age-related macular degeneration, we 
observed no clear sex difference (0·91 [0·70–1·14]).
Globally, although the age-specific prevalence has 
declined over time, the proportion of prevalent blindness 
in adults aged 50 years and older attributable to cataract 
has remained almost unchanged, showing a slight 
reduction from 36·7% (80% UI 30·1–43·2) in 1990 to 
35·1% (26·4–44·0) in 2015 (table 1; 91% posterior 
probability of decline over time based on our model), with 
a further decline to 34·7% (25·0–44·6) anticipated by 
2020 (appendix). The contribution of glaucoma (posterior 
probability of decline over time of 83%), age-related 
macular degeneration (posterior probability of decline 
of 99%), diabetic retinopathy (posterior probability of 
decline of 95%), and corneal opacity (posterior probability 
of decline of 85%) to blindness also declined between 
1990 and 2015 according to the posterior probability of the 
model. The contribution of uncorrected refractive error to 
blindness marginally increased (for all ages, the 
proportion in 1990 was 20·2% [80% UI 18·1–22·3] and in 
2015 was 20·6% [18·6–22·6]; appendix), and the other 
cause also increased.
Globally, the crude prevalence (all ages) of blindness due 
to all causes except for diabetic retinopathy reduced 
between 1990 and 2015 (expressed as the difference in

prevalence between 2015 and 1990 divided by the 1990 
prevalence multiplied by 100; percentage changes by cause 
were –16·6% for cataract, –13·3% for uncorrected refractive 
error, –37·0% for age-related macular degeneration, 
–15·7% for glaucoma, 7·7% for diabetic retinopathy, 
–43·2% for corneal opacity, and –68·9% for trachoma 
[appendix]). For vision impairment, these percentage 
changes by cause were –4·0% for cataract, –0·9% for 
uncorrected refractive error, –28·6% for age-related 
macular degeneration, –3·8% for glaucoma, 28·8% for 
diabetic retinopathy, –36·7% for corneal opacity, and 
–66·6% for trachoma (appendix). The crude prevalence of 
blindness and vision impairment by cause in 1990 and 2015 
for those aged 50 years and older is given in appendix. The 
percentage changes in age-standardised prevalence by 
cause for the same causes of blindness and vision 
impairment were as follows: cataract (blindness –42·0%; 
vision impairment –32·7%), uncorrected refractive error 
(–38·8%; –26·7%), age-related macular degeneration 
(56·6%; –46·7%), glaucoma (–38·7%; –27·6%), diabetic 
retinopathy (–13·7%; 9·6%), corneal opacity (–59·2%; 
–52·9%), and trachoma (–74·8%; –71·0%; appendix). Age-
standardised 
prevalence 
of 
blindness 
and 
vision 
impairment by cause in 1990 and 2015 for those aged 
50 years and older is given in the appendix.
Avoidable vision loss due to a preventable or treatable 
cause can be defined as any vision loss due to cataract, 
uncorrected refractive error, trachoma, glaucoma, 
diabetic retinopathy, or corneal opacity. With use of this 
definition, of the 190·4 million blind or vision impaired 
in 1990, 158·0 million (80% UI 54·3 million to 321 million 
[83·0% (69·4–98·1)]) had a preventable or treatable 
cause. Of the 233·3 million blind or vision impaired in 
2010, the number avoidable was 190·6 million 
(73·6 million to 372·3 million [81·7% (68·9–96·2)]), by 
2015, of 252·6 million, it was 205·1 million (75·4 million 
to 409·8 million [81·2% (67·7–96·5)]), and by 2020, of 
the projected 275.6 million, it is projected to be 
222·6 million (76·1 million to 457·5 million [80·8% 
(66·4–97·3)]). The number of people within the other 
cause category increased from 22 million (80% UI 
3 million to 70 million) in 1990 to 32 million (5 million to 
101 million) by 2010 and to 37 million (5 million to 
117 million) by 2015 and is projected to increase to 
42 million (6 million to 136 million) by 2020. 
Despite the observed reduction in crude or age-
standardised prevalence of cataract between 1990 and 
2015, the effect of growing and ageing populations means 
that the number of people affected by cause-specific 
blindness is actually increasing. The number of people 
affected by blindness due to cataract increased between 
1990 and 2015 from 10·9 million (80% UI 2·9 million to 
24·3 million) to 12·6 million (3·4 million to 28·7 million) 
and by vision impairment due to cataract from 
39·6 million (13·9 million to 80·0 million) to 52·6 million 
(18·2 million to 109·6 million; appendix). The decline in

prevalence of cataract blindness and vision impairment 
combined was most marked in eastern Europe and 
Latin American regions (with the age-standardised 
prevalence falling by more than 47% in these regions); the 
region with the smallest decline was east sub-Saharan 
Africa (appendix).
The number of people affected by blindness due to 
diabetic retinopathy increased between 1990 and 2015 
from 0·2 million (80% UI none to 1·0 million) to 
0·4 million (none to 1·5 million) and by vision 
impairment due to diabetic retinopathy increased from 
1·4 million (0·1 million to 5·4 million) to 2·6 million 
(0·2 million to 9·9 million; appendix). We observed a 
decrease in adult age-standardised prevalence of 
blindness and vision impairment due to diabetic 
retinopathy in all regions of sub-Saharan Africa, Oceania, 
Andean Latin America, central and eastern Europe, and 
the Caribbean, yet observed an increase in the high-
income subregions, Asian regions, and north Africa and 
the Middle East (appendix).
The number of people affected by blindness due to 
age-related macular degeneration reduced between 1990 
and 2015 from 2·2 million (80% UI 0·2 million to 
8·3 million) to 2·0 million (0·2 million to 7·3 million) 
and by vision impairment due to age-related macular 
degeneration reduced from 8·5 million (1·0 million to 
29·4 million) to 8·4 million (0·9 million to 29·5 million; 
appendix). We noted a decline in adult age-standardised 
prevalence of age-related macular degeneration blindness 
and vision impairment combined in all regions (appendix).
The number of people affected by blindness due to 
glaucoma increased between 1990 and 2015 from 
2·5 million (80% UI 0·3 million to 8·6 million) to 
3·0 million (0·4 million to 9·9 million) and by vision 
impairment due to glaucoma increased from 3·0 million 
(0·4 million to 9·9 million) to 4·0 million (0·6 million to 
13·3 million; appendix). We noted a decline in adult age-
standardised prevalence of glaucoma blindness and vision 
impairment combined in all regions, with a less marked 
reduction noted in sub-Saharan Africa regions and the 
high-income regions than in other regions (appendix).
The number of people affected by blindness due to 
uncorrected refractive error increased between 1990 and 
2015 from 6·2 million (80% UI 1·7 million to 12·9 million) 
to 7·4 million (2·4 million to 14·8 million) and by vision 
impairment increased from 84·8 million (33·1 million to 
151·5 million) to 116·3 million (49·4 million to 
202·1 million; appendix). We noted declining adult age-
standardised prevalence of uncorrected refractive error 
blindness and vision impairment combined in all regions 
(appendix). We also observed this decline when 
considering all ages (appendix).
The number of people affected by blindness due to 
corneal opacity (not related to trachoma) declined between 
1990 and 2015 from 1·6 million (80% UI 0·1 million to 
6·8 million) to 1·3 million (0·1 million to 5·2 million) and 
by visual impairment due to corneal opacity from 
3·3 million (0·2 million to 12·6 million) to 2·9 million 
(0·2 million to 10·5 million; appendix). We noted a decline 
in adult and all-age age-standardised and crude prevalence 
of corneal opacity blindness and vision impairment 
combined in all regions, with a less marked reduction 
noted in sub-Saharan Africa regions, east Asia, and high-
income regions than in the other world regions (appendix).
Of the 216·6 milllion people of all ages with moderate 
or severe vision impairment in 2015, 78% were vision 
impaired due to cataract or uncorrected refractive error, 
whereas these causes were responsible for 56% of the 
36·0 million people blind.
The number of people affected by blindness due to 
trachoma sharply reduced between 1990 and 2015 from 
0·9 million (80% UI 0·3 million to 1·8 million) to 
0·4 million (0·1 million to 0·9 million) and by vision 
impairment due to trachoma reduced from 3·5 million 
(1·4 million to 6·3 million) to 1·6 million (0·5 million to 
3·3 million; appendix).
By 2020, among the global population with moderate 
or severe vision impairment (237·1 million [80% UI 
101·5 million to 399·0 million]), uncorrected refractive 
error is estimated to affect 127·7 million (51·0 million to 
225·3 million) people, with the next commonest cause 
of 
vision 
impairment 
being 
cataract, 
affecting 
57·1 million (17·9 million to 124·1 million), then age-
related macular degeneration, affecting 8·8 million 
(0·8 million to 32·1 million), then glaucoma, affecting 
4·5 million (0·5 million to 15·4 million), and then 
diabetic retinopathy, affecting 3·2 million (0·2 million 
to 12·9 million; appendix). Among a global blind 
population of 38·5 million (13·2 million to 70·9 million) 
people in 2020, the greatest number of people blind by 
cause is estimated to be due to cataract (13·4 million 
[3·3 million to 31·6 million]) followed by uncorrected 
refractive error (8·0 million [2·5 million to 16·3 million]), 
glaucoma (3·2 million [0·4 million to 11·0 million]), and 
age-related 
macular 
degeneration 
(2·0 
million 
[0·2 million to 7·6 million]; appendix). From 1990 to 2015 
and in 2020 projections, the low-prevalence causes of 
blindness and vision impairment (unspecified in this 
analysis and most vision impairment surveys) in 
aggregate make up an increasingly large proportion of 
the burden of disease (appendix).
Discussion
This study is a continuation of a series of systematic 
analyses, most recently for 2010 estimations.2 Refreshment 
of the Global Vision Database added a further 
61 population-based studies, of which 44 contributed 
disaggregated vision impairment prevalence data by 
cause. 28 new studies involved rapid assessment of 
avoidable blindness survey methods, from which at least 
cataract-specific prevalence could be extracted. In 
preparing the new estimates for 2015, we revisited all the 
studies within the Global Vision Database as a whole, with 
an interest in exploring the contribution of causes that are

not considered separate causes by the Global Burden of 
Disease Study—eg, myopic macular degeneration and 
amblyopia—causes that are known to be of great 
importance in some populations.3 Data sparsity meant 
that meaningful global estimates for these low-prevalence 
conditions could not be made. These causes will therefore 
be contributors to the other cause category, which remains 
large. However, we did have sufficient data sources to 
disaggregate non-trachomatous corneal opacity as a cause 
of vision impairment. Studies have substantiated corneal 
opacity as a common cause of childhood8 and adult3,4 
blindness. A WHO report9 in 2002 stated that 5·1% of 
blindness was estimated to be a result of corneal 
opacification. This figure falls within the interval of 
uncertainty for our estimates in both 1990 and 2015. The 
challenge with reporting of corneal opacity as a cause of 
bilateral vision impairment is that, historically, the specific 
cause of the opacity was not reported in population-based 
surveys. The various known causes of corneal opacification 
include corneal injury; infection; dystrophy; keratoconus; 
iridocorneal endothelial syndrome; and other specific 
causes, such as onchocerciasis, trachoma, and iatrogenic 
causes.10 In the past, smallpox was a potent cause of 
bilateral corneal blindness. In the case of corneal opacity, 
considerable imprecision exists at the regional level for 
reasons of data sparsity and one has to be cautious about 
these regional results.
Several limitations apply to a causal analysis of this type. 
Many country-years remained without data or only had 
subnational data, and only 12 national studies reporting 
vision impairment for all ages and all causes were available. 
Case definitions varied between studies, and other causes 
contributed to 25% of the blindness burden of 2015 and 
13% of that of vision impairment. We used a similar 
approach for trachoma as for the previous meta-analysis,2 
which derived estimates for the prevalence of trachoma 
from 
nationally 
representative 
surveys 
of 
vision 
impairment and a Bayesian predictive model that used 
data for the prevalence of trichiasis,5 a complication of 
trachoma that is a direct cause of vision impairment. The 
analysis was limited in that no data for prevalence of 
trachoma or trichiasis existed in 24 countries considered 
by WHO to have trachoma endemic areas. We therefore 
conservatively assumed a trachoma cause proportion of 
zero for these countries, which could have led to an 
underestimation of the prevalence of trachoma as a cause 
of 
blindness 
and 
vision 
impairment. 
Substantial 
improvements in reduction of trachoma prevalence 
and increases in the number of surgical operations 
for trichiasis would account for the observed reduction 
in vision impairment.11 Protocols often dictate that 
population-based studies report one cause as the principal 
cause for an individual examined in that particular study to 
arrive at the causal prevalence. When coexisting disorders 
contributed equally to blindness or vision impairment, 
only the ‘‘most readily curable’’ or ‘‘most easily preventable’’ 
was recorded.12 This approach had the potential to 
underestimate the effect of diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, 
or other diseases when the survey participant presented 
with cataract, while underestimating the burden of cataract 
when participants also have an uncorrected refractive 
error.13 Some studies had a small sample size, therefore the 
CIs of the cause-specific prevalence estimate were large. 
Our methods took into account sample size, so studies 
with small sample sizes influenced the estimates less than 
studies with large sample sizes did, and estimated 
uncertainty was large when only small studies were 
available. Most sample sizes for vision impairment surveys 
are powered to achieve precision of the all-cause blindness 
estimate, with inadequate sample size for precision of a 
cause-specific prevalence of blindness. Risk factors such as 
race or ethnicity are associated with specific causes such as 
glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration. Our 
modelling exercise did not characterise these risk factors, 
yet in future analyses, these factors would be important 
covariates to consider in the model. Our model does not 
include a varying refractive error term by region, which 
accounts for the proportion of vision impairment due to 
refractive error remaining constant across all regions 
except for south Asia. More regional specificity than in this 
study for uncorrected refractive error will be a feature 
of future updates. Greater imprecision in the definition 
of macular degeneration in older studies might have 
contributed to the unexpectedly large declines in 
age-specific blindness and vision impairment due to age-
related macular degeneration that our model indicates. 
Older time periods might have been more influenced by 
misclassification of any kind of maculopathy as being age-
related macular degeneration and information about age-
related macular degeneration trends might be weaker than 
for the other specified diseases. Relative differences in 
prevalence of vision impairment or blindness by cause 
over time should not be overinterpreted as they correspond 
to very small absolute differences. Instead, we have drawn 
attention to our estimates of substantial change over time 
on the basis of the model, which demonstrates temporal 
differences in terms of the relative attributable fractions, 
rather than the crude overall prevalences. Caution should 
be exercised in interpretation of projections to 2020 by 
cause. These projections assumed that the UN population 
projections for the future were correct and the covariates 
that we used in our model for access to health care14 and 
literacy,15 which have not been modelled into the future, 
will remain unchanged after 2015.
The strengths of our study included addition of 61 new 
studies in this refreshment of the Global Vision Database 
and also some additional cause-specific data to existing 
studies in the database; analysis of trends in the causes of 
vision impairment, with projections to 2020; increasing 
differentiation of age-related macular degeneration from 
other maculopathies; incorporation of non-linear age 
trends and accounting for data that were not reported by 
age; and systematic quantitative analysis and reporting 
of uncertainty.

The top three causes of blindness in 2015 were cataract, 
uncorrected refractive error, and glaucoma and for vision 
impairment were uncorrected refractive error, cataract, 
and age-related macular degeneration. We noted large 
differences in the distribution of causes of blindness by 
region. Although the prevalence of cataract blindness 
exceeded that caused by age-related macular degeneration 
in high-income subregions, these regions had a lower 
prevalence of cataract and higher prevalence of age-
related macular degeneration as causes of blindness and 
vision impairment than did other regions. Although we 
have not modelled age effects within those aged 50 years 
and older, the prevalence of cause-specific blindness is 
anticipated to increase in the much older age groups, in 
keeping with the precipitous increase in global blindness 
prevalence of all causes observed in our previous analysis 
(50–54 years 0·4%; 75–79 years 4%; >90 years 11%).1
In our report1 of all-cause prevalence, more women 
than men were vision impaired, with a world female-to-
male age-standardised prevalence ratio among adults of 
1·05 for blindness and 1·07 for moderate or severe vision 
impairment. In this further analysis by cause, we noted 
no clear sex difference in the prevalence of blindness or 
vision impairment caused by age-related macular 
degeneration; this finding concurs with a meta-analysis16 
of 39 population-based studies, which did not find 
evidence of sex difference in the prevalence of both early 
and late age-related macular degeneration prevalence. 
Likewise, our finding of a male preponderance in those 
vision impaired because of glaucoma concurs with a 
meta-analysis of 50 studies by Tham and colleagues,17 
which reported a higher prevalence of primary open 
angle glaucoma among men than among women. A 
meta-analysis18 
of 
diabetic 
retinopathy 
prevalence 
showed a similar prevalence for men and women 
when considering any diabetic retinopathy or vision-
threatening diabetic retinopathy, whereas our analysis 
suggested a female preponderance for vision-impairing 
diabetic retinopathy. Our finding was surprising and the 
new data added to the Global Vision Database for diabetic 
retinopathy were actually aggregated data, with men and 
women combined. This discrepancy highlights the need 
for future research into this sex difference and the need to 
disaggregate between men and women in reporting of 
research. Like our previous report2 that presented an 
increase in causal contribution of diabetic retinopathy to 
blindness between 1990 and 2010, we report in this study 
that between 1990 and 2015, the proportion due to this 
cause has increased, as has the crude and age-standardised 
prevalence of blindness due to diabetic retinopathy. 
However, the statistical test of posterior probability 
suggested a decline over this time period. Wide prevalence 
uncertainty intervals make it difficult to reach a 
conclusion as to the nature of this temporal change. Since 
our previous report, several rapid assessment studies 
involving a diabetic retinopathy module  have been added 
to the Global Vision Database. Additionally, considerable 
regional differences exist in vision impairment or 
blindness due to diabetic retinopathy. Since the life 
expectancy of individuals with diabetes, in particular in 
south Asia, is reduced,19 they often do not have the chance 
to develop diabetic retinopathy as a sequela of diabetes. 
This factor could explain the finding that, despite a high 
proportion of diabetes in the population,20 the prevalence 
of diabetic retinopathy as a cause of vision impairment 
and blindness is low in that world region. With further 
improvement in the medical infrastructure in south Asia 
and an increase of life expectancy for patients with 
diabetes, an increase in the prevalence of diabetic 
retinopathy might be expected.
82·9% of people blind or vision impaired in 1990 had a 
preventable or treatable cause, decreasing to 81·7% by 
2010 and to 81·2% by 2015 and it is projected to be 80·8% 
in 2020. A further proportion of people blind or vision 
impaired due to other causes will have a preventable or 
treatable cause, such as onchocerciasis. The number of 
people within the other cause category increased from 
22 million in 1990 to 32 million by 2010 and to 37 million 
by 2015 and is projected to increase to 42 million by 2020, 
therefore the increase in cases ascribed to other causes 
could have masked what would otherwise have been a 
more profound reduction in the proportion of cases with 
avoidable or preventable causes than shown in this study. 
Member States of WHO have agreed to work towards a 
reduction of prevalence of avoidable vision impairment 
of 25% by 2019 from the baseline established in 2010. 
This Global Action Plan21 includes only uncorrected 
refractive error and cataract as the avoidable causes. In 
2010, 2·5% of the world’s population was estimated to be 
blind or vision impaired due to these two causes. By 
2020, we estimate that this proportion will be 2·7% 
(largely because of population ageing) unless specific 
activities to address these needs are increased. The 2010 
baseline estimate for avoidable blindness and vision 
impairment used by the Global Action Plan was 3·18%, 
calculated from data from a less sophisticated statistical 
model22 than in our study as follows: (crude prevalence of 
vision impairment × proportion due to cataract) + (crude 
prevalence of vision impairment × proportion due to 
uncorrected refractive error), whereas our 2010 estimate 
using the same formula was 2·49%. For this reason and 
also the fact that the statistical models and data sources 
used for these two sets of estimates are different, one 
should be cautious in making this comparison, yet we 
are reporting a rise of 5·6% compared with the planned 
25% reduction set by WHO.
On the basis of our findings and those of the previous 
report,2 some clear recommendations emerge for future 
research in this area. Improvements in modelling of 
causal data can be obtained by giving consideration to 
potential upstream health system factors that influence 
cause attribution in different studies at different times. 
These indicators and other health system indicators for 
the country or region at the time of the eye survey, such

as existence of universal access to basic eye care, 
availability of free access to essential ocular medicines, 
whether or not a diabetic retinopathy screening 
programme exists, the cataract surgical coverage rate, eye 
care staff to population ratios, and proportion of gross 
domestic product spent on health care, are under 
consideration as part of an international project to assess 
the quality and risk of bias of national population-based 
surveys of vision impairment. This line of analysis was 
initiated at the World Ophthalmology Congress of 2016 
by the Vision Loss Expert Group. Greater standardisation 
of measurement protocols and case definitions than at 
present in surveys is recommended, with greater 
sophistication in the definition of potentially avoidable 
conditions in both surveys and meta-analyses to reflect 
changing treatments and enhanced understanding over 
time. As population-based surveys become more precise 
at 
identifying 
specific 
causes 
than 
at 
present, 
disaggregation by cause when reporting on causes of 
vision impairment becomes increasingly important.
Of the 216·6 milllion people of all ages with moderate 
or severe vision impairment in 2015, 78% were vision 
impaired because of cataract or uncorrected refractive 
error, which are completely treatable causes, with these 
causes responsible for 56% of the 36·0 million people 
blind. Glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration, 
corneal opacity, diabetic retinopathy, and trachoma were 
less frequent causes of blindness and vision impairment 
than were cataract or uncorrected refractive error, some of 
which are preventable and treatable as well. Globally, the 
overall crude prevalence of blindness and vision 
impairment that incorporates all of these causes reduced 
between 1990 and 2015.1 However, with growing and 
ageing populations, the number of people affected 
by cause-specific blindness is generally increasing. 
Projections to 2020, an important milestone for the 
WHO’s Global Action Plan,21 lead us to conclude that the 
prevalence of avoidable vision impairment is not reducing 
fast enough to keep pace with this demographic change 
in the world’s population, so more attention to this 
problem is needed than has been given to it so far.
