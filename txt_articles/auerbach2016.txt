IMPORTANCE Readmission penalties have catalyzed efforts to improve care transitions, but
few programs have incorporated viewpoints of patients and health care professionals to
determine readmission preventability or to prioritize opportunities for care improvement.
OBJECTIVES To determine preventability of readmissions and to use these estimates to
prioritize areas for improvement.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS An observational study was conducted of 1000 general
medicine patients readmitted within 30 days of discharge to 12 US academic medical centers
between April 1, 2012, and March 31, 2013. We surveyed patients and physicians, reviewed
documentation, and performed 2-physician case review to determine preventability of and
factors contributing to readmission. We used bivariable statistics to compare preventable and
nonpreventable readmissions, multivariable models to identify factors associated with
potential preventability, and baseline risk factor prevalence and adjusted odds ratios (aORs)
to determine the proportion of readmissions affected by individual risk factors.
MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE Likelihood that a readmission could have been prevented.
RESULTS The study cohort comprised 1000 patients (median age was 55 years). Of these,
269 (26.9%) were considered potentially preventable. In multivariable models, factors most
strongly associated with potential preventability included emergency department decision
making regarding the readmission (aOR, 9.13; 95% CI, 5.23-15.95), failure to relay important
information to outpatient health care professionals (aOR, 4.19; 95% CI, 2.17-8.09), discharge
of patients too soon (aOR, 3.88; 95% CI, 2.44-6.17), and lack of discussions about care goals
among patients with serious illnesses (aOR, 3.84; 95% CI, 1.39-10.64). The most common
factors associated with potentially preventable readmissions included emergency
department decision making (affecting 9.0%; 95% CI, 7.1%-10.3%), inability to keep
appointments after discharge (affecting 8.3%; 95% CI, 4.1%-12.0%), premature discharge
from the hospital (affecting 8.7%; 95% CI, 5.8%-11.3%), and patient lack of awareness of
whom to contact after discharge (affecting 6.2%; 95% CI, 3.5%-8.7%).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Approximately one-quarter of readmissions are potentially
preventable when assessed using multiple perspectives. High-priority areas for improvement
efforts include improved communication among health care teams and between health care
professionals and patients, greater attention to patients’readiness for discharge, enhanced
disease monitoring, and better support for patient self-management.

D
espite continuous and robust efforts, the ability of
health systems to reduce hospital readmissions has
been disappointing.1 The discouraging progress in
reducing readmissions across broad populations points to
potential gaps in health systems and communities,2-6 as
well as to shortcomings of broad-based readmission re-
duction programs, few of which have fulfilled their initial
promise.7-9
Underlying readmission reduction programs are the con-
cepts that some proportion of readmissions is preventable2,3,10
and that identifying and addressing the drivers of “prevent-
able” readmissions can improve the effectiveness of care
transitions programs.11 However, few nationally representa-
tive data exist to define the frequency of readmission
preventability.3,12 Moreover, national data are lacking on
whether specific care processes, patients’needs, or comor-
bidities are more associated or less associated with prevent-
ability. Finally, although small studies7,8,13 have included
viewpoints of patients in understanding readmission pre-
ventability, few large-scale studies have explicitly included
their viewpoints and that of their physicians in determining
preventability.14
To explore these questions, we performed an observa-
tional study of general medicine patients readmitted within
30 days of discharge to 12 academic medical centers in the
United States. We collected data from patient and physician
surveys and medical record review to identify factors con-
tributing to readmissions. After aggregating information
from these sources, we used a structured case review pro-
cess to determine if a readmission was potentially prevent-
able, whether clinical or health care delivery processes
could have contributed to the readmission, and which of
these processes were most commonly associated with pre-
ventable readmissions.
Methods
Sites and Participants
Our study took place in the Hospital Medicine Reengineering
Network (HOMERuN), a national network of hospital medi-
cine investigators at 12 academic medical centers.15 Patients
in our study were discharged by general medicine services at
HOMERuN sites and readmitted (also to a general medicine
service) within 30 days of discharge between April 1, 2012, and
March 31, 2013.
Eligible patients were 18 years or older and spoke English
as their primary language. Patients who had a scheduled re-
admission (eg, for chemotherapy or a procedure) were ex-
cluded.Withintheeligiblesample,weusedarandom-digitgen-
eration schema to select up to 5 patients per week at each site
for interview and study participation. If a patient declined an
interview, was too sick to participate, was unavailable, or oth-
erwise declined participation, the next randomly selected pa-
tient was approached for enrollment. Institutional review
boards at the University of California, San Francisco (the data
coordinating center) and all participating HOMERuN sites ap-
proved the study.
Data Collection
Data were collected from interviews with patients, from re-
views of available inpatient and outpatient medical records,
and from surveys of patients’physicians (primary care phy-
sician when available, discharging inpatient physician from
the index admission, and inpatient physician from the read-
mission). After obtaining written informed consent, trained re-
search assistants administered patient interviews that in-
cluded fixed-choice and open-ended questions to learn about
patients’perceptions of their care during their previous ad-
mission and their experience since discharge. Fixed-choice
items included the following domains: social support, qual-
ity of communication with hospital physicians, whether a fol-
low-up appointment was made and attended, and perceived
ability to manage medications, symptoms, and appoint-
ments after discharge. Open-ended questions asked patients
aboutanyproblemsinrecoverythattheyexperiencedafterthe
index discharge, as well as what patients thought could have
helped avoid a readmission to the hospital.
We then emailed or faxed up to 5 surveys to each pa-
tient’
s primary care physician, physician from the index ad-
mission, and current attending physician. Physician surveys
asked questions regarding their impression of factors contrib-
uting to the readmission and aspects of care that could have
been improved, such as timely communication about dis-
charge plans. Physicians were encouraged to read the medi-
cal record to better inform their answers to survey questions.
Using this approach, we received 359 responses from
primary care physicians, 683 responses from physicians from
the index admission, and 743 responses from current attend-
ing physicians. All cases had at least 1 physician survey avail-
able at the time of case review.
Next, research assistants performed a structured medical
record review, collecting information regarding patients’co-
morbidities and medications. They also recorded medical re-
cord–based measures of care transitions processes (eg, re-
ceipt of a reconciled list of medications at the time of the index
hospital discharge).
Measure Development
Our medical record–based measures were determined based
onthosecriteriaproposedbytheNationalQualityForum’
sCare
Coordination Measures16 and other published standards for
dischargedocumentationcompleteness.17Patientsurveyques-
tions included modified items from the 3-item Care Transi-
tion Measure18 and the interpersonal processes of care
measure.19,20 Physician surveys were developed to include
questions that paralleled those questions asked in our case re-
view process (see the next subsection below), as well as im-
pressions of key transitions processes (eg, the completeness
of the discharge summary). Before use, all surveys were pre-
tested among the investigator group and with physicians not
associated with the study.

dard in defining preventability in adverse drug events and care
transitions gaps.22-29 We further refined past approaches to
permit implementation across multiple sites, while adding
processes to retain intersite and longitudinal intrareviewer
consistency.
Our case review process had the following 2 key ob-
jectives: (1) to determine whether readmission was poten-
tially preventable and (2) to identify factors that contributed
to readmission, regardless of preventability. Case reviewers
chose from a large set of potential factors that were identified
and categorized using the framework of the Ideal Transitions
in Care.30 In assessing preventability, we trained case review-
ers to consider patient illness but to primarily focus on sys-
tem flaws and gaps in care that could have been avoided with
reasonable patient or physician activities. As a framing ex-
ample, we trained physician adjudicators to consider an “ideal
health system” as a model for system and care assessment,
even if all aspects of an ideal system did not exist at their site.
For example, if a patient’
s readmission appeared to be related
to the inability to obtain a postdischarge appointment, we in-
structed case reviewers to consider it a preventable readmis-
sion because an ideal system would be able to accommodate
these patients’needs without requiring readmission.
We assigned preventability with a scale used in previous
research regarding care transitions.22,28 Within this scale, we
further defined a threshold of “greater than 50-50, but close
call” as a standard cutoff, also based on previous studies.22,28
This approach is useful in that it links an approach that en-
courages reviewers to explicitly avoid a “neutral” response in
assessing preventability and provides a valid cut point that can
help direct intervention strategies.
Physician reviewers had access to completed patient in-
terviews, physician surveys, data derived from abstracted
medical records, and the complete medical record. At a mini-
mum, each case review packet included the patient inter-
view, a complete medical record review, and at least 1 physi-
cian survey. All physician adjudicators reviewed several
reference cases during a series of weekly webinars and con-
ferencecalls.Asthecasereviewworkproceeded,eachsitepre-
sented at least 2 anonymized cases for group discussion dur-
ing biweekly conference calls to foster consistency among
physician adjudicators.
The Hospital Medicine Reengineering Network did not cal-
culate interrater reliability as part of its methods and instead
used a 2-physician case review process to assign preventabil-
ity.Weprovidedsubstantialstructureandsupportforthedual-
physician reviews. All reviews were performed by physicians
who were initially trained via our physician review guides, and
thenbyhavingallreviewersperform“test”reviewsandbyregu-
larly discussing reviews at biweekly conference calls. In addi-
tion, we maintained an “FAQ” document for how to adjudi-
cate various situations, with an email of all updates as they
becameavailable,andmaintainedaresourceforteachingpoints
and clarifications using a HOMERuN wiki webpage.
Each site had a pool of 3 to 10 physician adjudicators co-
ordinated by a physician lead, who oversaw the process and
resolved difficult cases. A pair of physician adjudicators re-
viewed all available information for each case and developed
the initial assessments, after which the pair made a final as-
sessment of the case jointly. Site physician leads were respon-
sible for resolving any challenging cases, and these cases were
also reviewed at regular telephone conference calls.
Statistical Analysis
We first characterized study patients using univariable meth-
ods. Readmissions were categorized as preventable if physi-
cian adjudicators rated the likelihood of preventability as 50%
ormore(≥4ona6-pointscale),asdoneinpreviousstudies.22,28
Using bivariable methods, we then compared patients whose
readmissions were judged to be preventable vs those whose
readmissions were judged to be nonpreventable in terms of
factors that contributed to the readmission.
We selected potential contributing factors after initially
screening for those variables with an unadjusted P value for
association with preventability of P ≤ .20. Using these initial
variables,wethenconstructedhierarchicalmultivariablemod-
els, including clustering at the hospital level to predict pre-
ventability of readmissions. If covariates had high bivariable
correlation, we considered only one for model inclusion by ex-
cluding variables with lower face validity. We next used a back-
ward stepwise approach to develop our final model by remov-
ing variables until the final covariates were associated with the
outcome at P < .05. We then used our final model to calculate
the percentage of the preventable readmissions that were po-
tentially affected by each identified risk factor. Specifically, we
calculated an adjusted risk difference of preventable readmis-
sion for the model between cases with and without the fac-
tor,andthenmultipliedthisvaluebytheprevalenceinourdata
of the factor and divided by the overall proportion of prevent-
able readmissions.31 All analyses were performed using sta-
tistical software (SAS, version 9.4; SAS Institute, Inc).

care processes (eg, having enough time to say what they
thought was important or perceiving that their physician took
their preferences into account) and in terms of their ability to
manage their care after discharge. However, patients who re-

(18.6% [50 of 269] vs 5.7% [42 of 731]), patient need for addi-

in discharge plans (17.8% [48 of 269] vs 7.8% [57 of 731]), dis-
charge of patients too soon (eg, symptoms such as inability to
eat or dyspnea not completely managed) from the index hos-
pitalization (19.3% [52 of 269] vs 4.0% [29 of 731]), and issues
related to the decision to admit the patient made in the emer-

Factors Independently Associated
With Potentially Preventable Readmissions
In multivariable models, 4 factors were most strongly associ-
ated with potentially preventable readmissions. These in-
cludedprematuredischargefromtheindexhospitalization(ad-
justedoddsratio[aOR],3.88;95%CI,2.44-6.17),failuretorelay

als(aOR,4.19;95%CI,2.17-8.09),lackofdiscussionsaboutcare
goals among patients with serious illnesses (aOR, 3.84; 95%
CI, 1.39-10.64), and emergency department decision making
to admit a patient who may not have required an inpatient stay
(aOR, 9.13; 95% CI, 5.23-15.95). The most common factors as-
sociated with potentially preventable readmissions included
emergency department decision making (affecting 9.0%, 95%
CI, 7.1%-10.3%), inability to keep appointments after
discharge (affecting 8.3%; 95% CI, 4.1%-12.0%), premature dis-
charge from the hospital (affecting 8.7%; 95% CI, 5.8%-
11.3%), and patient lack of awareness of whom to contact
after discharge (affecting 6.2%; 95% CI, 3.5%-8.7%) (Table 5).
In sensitivity analyses, we performed multivariable
models that excluded data from sites with fewer than 50 pa-
tients, and these results were similar to those findings already

Discussion
In this multicenter, multiperspective study of readmitted pa-
tients, 26.9% (269 of 1000) of readmissions were considered
potentially preventable, with half of these readmissions
thought to represent gaps in care during the initial inpatient
stay. Structured case review with multiple viewpoints, includ-
ing perspectives of patients, identified a prioritized list of tar-
gets for refined care transitions programs.
Our estimates of readmission preventability are within the
ranges suggested by other researchers3 but extend previous
work in important ways. Our review process linked a compre-
hensive picture of clinical care, one that included viewpoints
of patients, to a rigorous case review process that sought to
identify not only readmission preventability but also oppor-
tunities for improvement. The process whereby we identi-
fied potential improvement targets also represents an impor-
tant feature of our work. That is, our focus on an ideal health
system lens for determining preventability provides a safe-
guardagainstfatalisticinterpretationsofreadmissionsas“non-
preventable” or solely owing to advancing illnesses, while also
allowing us to identify factors that should be addressed so that
improvement leads toward an “ideal.”
An ideal transition of care1,8 can include a dauntingly wide
range of potential programs30 for health systems to imple-
ment and manage. Our calculations providing estimates of the
proportion of potentially preventable readmissions affected
by each risk factor can help prioritize efforts by weighting the
odds of individual associations using the prevalence of the risk
factor in our population. While the effectiveness of indi-
vidual programs addressing individual gaps in care likely var-
ies across issues, our study adds substantially to previous work
by providing a prioritization schema that is useful in the be-
ginningofprogramdevelopment.Perhapsnotsurprisingly,the
use of population-based estimation produced a ranked list of
important underlying causes for readmission that differed
slightly from the list of factors ranked by adjusted odds. The
list of factors that overlap in terms of risk and potential effect
is shorter still, providing a potential approach to prioritizing
readmission reduction efforts.
One key observation in our cohort related to improving de-
cision making for patients arriving in the emergency depart-

for patients who would otherwise seek care in an emergency
departmentandimprovingpatients’understandingofhowand
when to seek emergency care.
Our research also adds to the existing literature on read-
missions by identifying the possibility that premature dis-
charge from the hospital may contribute to readmission risk.
While secondary data analyses have not demonstrated a cor-
relation between shortening lengths of stay and readmission
rates nationally,32 our data suggest that in the current era some
proportion of readmissions may be prevented with better at-
tention to patients’readiness for discharge33 in terms of their
ability to manage care after discharge or recover from (or de-
velop an effective management plan for) symptoms, such as
dyspnea, vomiting, and pain.
Our results were also notable for factors that were not
found to be key underlying contributors. Functional status is
a clear risk factor for readmission34,35 but in our cohort of re-
admitted patients was not associated with potential prevent-
ability. Patient reports of care processes and satisfaction with
care were not associated with readmission preventability in
our data, suggesting that patient satisfaction with care, while
valuableforotherreasons,maynotbeavalidapproachtoiden-
tifying readmission program priorities. Disconnect between
most patients’perceptions of care and readmission prevent-
abilitymayalsorepresentgapsintheabilityofsatisfactionmea-
sures to detect patients’actual ability to carry out the dis-
charge plan.
Ourstudyhassomelimitations.Whileourcasereviewpro-
cess has strengths, it was limited by the subjective nature of
determining preventability of readmissions. For example, we
cannot rule out biases of our reviewers regarding which fac-
tors may have contributed to readmission preventability. How-
ever, our results are similar to other estimates of preventabil-
ity, and our training and quality assurance processes sought
to maintain consistency of our approach across sites. Also, no
patient factors were retained in our final models, but we can-
not rule out the possibility of confounding by patient factors
that were associated with both the identified risk factors and
potentialpreventability.Inaddition,itispossiblethatourmedi-
cal record tools may have led to instrument bias that may have
limited our ability to detect factors outside of our tool’
s list.
That said, the list of factors we collected from patients, phy-
sicians, and medical records was large and is based on exist-
ing frameworks.30 In addition, the large number of factors that
were found to be significant makes the threat of this bias less
likely. While our study included patients from a variety of hos-
pitals, most were large academic medical centers, potentially
limiting generalizability. Also limiting generalizability are our
criteria that excluded non–English-speaking patients and pa-

reasons for refusal among potentially eligible patients. That
said, our cohort is similar to previous studies36,37 of read-
mitted patients from our sites that did not use exclusion cri-
teria. Our approach was associated with variation in rates of
preventability across sites, which could represent true
variation in care processes but also possible inconsistency
of case review across sites. However, despite potential
variation in case review processes, the factors we identified
were robust in sensitivity analyses that excluded patients
from the sites with the highest and lowest rates of prevent-
ability. Finally, population-attributable estimates can be
used to prioritize potential benefits but do not take into
account the effectiveness or cost of those programs. These
estimates are best-case scenarios in terms of the proportion
of readmissions that could be prevented, assuming 100%
preventability owing to that factor and 100% efficacy of an
intervention designed to address it.
Conclusions
Multicomponent care transitions programs are a desired ap-
proach to improving patient outcomes in the period after acute
care. Because our study cannot ascribe causality to the fac-
tors we have identified, our results cannot support the con-
clusion that eliminating the factors we identified will surely
reduce readmissions. The answer to that question will re-
quire further studies. Our study formulates a potential ap-
proach for prioritizing local efforts, as well as monitoring the
effectiveness of programs in place. Finally, our results sug-
gest a potential approach to focus interventions in ways that
span the continuum of care, prioritize efforts to prepare pa-
tients more effectively for discharge, and provide better abil-
ityforpatients,caregivers,andhealthcareprofessionalstosup-
port patients and improve outcomes during the period after
hospitalization.
