SUMMARY
We conducted comprehensive integrative molecular
analyses of the complete set of tumors in The Cancer
Genome Atlas (TCGA), consisting of approximately
10,000 specimens and representing 33 types of
cancer. We performed molecular clustering using
data on chromosome-arm-level aneuploidy, DNA hy-
permethylation, mRNA, and miRNA expression levels
and reverse-phase protein arrays, of which all, except
for aneuploidy, revealed clustering primarily orga-
nized by histology, tissue type, or anatomic origin.
The influence of cell type was evident in DNA-methyl-
ation-based clustering, even after excluding sites
with known preexisting tissue-type-specific methyl-
ation. Integrative clustering further emphasized the
dominant role of cell-of-origin patterns. Molecular
similarities among histologically
or
anatomically
related cancer types provide a basis for focused
pan-cancer analyses, such as pan-gastrointestinal,
pan-gynecological, pan-kidney, and pan-squamous
cancers, and those related by stemness features,
which in turn may inform strategies for future thera-
peutic development.
INTRODUCTION
Genomic and other molecular analyses across many types of
cancer have revealed a striking diversity of genomic aberrations,
altered signaling pathways, and oncogenic processes. We
hypothesized
that
this
diversity
arises
from
endogenous
factors, such as developmental and differentiation programs
and epigenetic states of the originating cells, in conjunction
with
exogenous
factors,
such
as
mutagenic
exposures,
pathogens, and inflammation. Here, we performed an integrative
analysis of approximately 10,000 human samples representing
33 different cancers, to provide the first comprehensive view of
the molecular factors that distinguish different neoplasms in
The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).

 In 2014, TCGA Research Network reported an interim analysis
of 3,527 tumors from 12 different cancer types (Pan-Cancer-12),
integrating six genome-wide platforms that assayed tumor
DNA (exome sequencing, DNA methylation, and copy number),
RNA (mRNA and microRNA sequencing), and a cancer-relevant
set of proteins and phosphoproteins (Hoadley et al., 2014). The
analysis tested the hypothesis that molecular signatures might
provide a taxonomy that differed from the current organ- and
tissue-histology-based pathology classification (Hoadley et al.,
2014). This effort extended beyond cancer subtype classification
by individual molecular platforms by employing an integrated
clustering algorithm to identify higher-level structures and
relationships. These integrated subtypes shared mutations,
copy-number alterations, pathway commonalities, and micro-
environment characteristics that appeared influential in the
new molecular taxonomy, beyond any phenotypic contributions
from tumor stage or tissue of origin. We estimated that at least
one in ten cancer patients might be classified (and perhaps
treated) differently using such a molecular taxonomy, rather
than the current histopathology-based classification.
Given that the earlier analysis included only a third of the final
set of TCGA tumors, it seemed appropriate to analyze all 33 tu-
mor types (called the PanCancer Atlas) to address the intriguing
questions left unanswered: whether the inclusion of many more
tumors and tumor types enhances the number of cross-tissue
associations, produces additional convergent and/or divergent
integrated molecular subtypes, and significantly increases the
fraction of cancer patients whose classification or treatment
might be affected by this new taxonomic approach.
We present a new PanCancer Atlas integrative analysis using
iCluster (Shen et al., 2009, 2012) identifying 28 distinct molecular
subtypes arising from the 33 different tumor types analyzed
across at least four different TCGA platforms. We confirmed
significant taxonomic divergences from and convergences with
the routinely used clinical tumor classification system. We em-
ployed a new 2D visualization approach, TumorMap (Newton
et al., 2017), to intepret the relationships between the samples
and iClusters. The PanCancer Atlas molecular classification also
provides a rationale for several TCGA analyses based on organ
systems or differentiation states, including pan-gastrointestinal
(GI) (Liu et al., 2018), pan-gynecological (gyn) (Berger et al.,
2018), pan-kidney (Ricketts et al., 2018), pan-squamous (Camp-
belletal.,2018),andcancerstemnessfeatures(Maltaetal.,2018).
RESULTS
Specimens and Tumor Types
This PanCancer study encompassed 11,286 tumor samples from
33 cancer types, for which molecular data were available from at
leastoneofthefiveassayplatforms.Ofthese,9,759hadcomplete
data for 4 platforms: aneuploidy, DNA methylation, mRNA and
miRNA. RPPA protein data were available for a subset of samples
(7,858). Hematologic and lymphatic malignancies included acute
myeloid leukemia (LAML), lymphoid neoplasm diffuse large B cell
lymphoma (DLBC), andthymoma (THYM). Solid tumor types were
from gynecologic (ovarian [OV], uterine corpus endometrial
carcinoma [UCEC], cervical squamous cell carcinoma and endo-
cervical adenocarcinoma [CESC], and breast invasive carcinoma
[BRCA]), urologic (bladder urothelial carcinoma [BLCA], prostate
adenocarcinoma [PRAD], testicular germ cell tumors [TGCT], kid-
ney renal clear cell carcinoma [KIRC], kidney chromophobe
[KICH], and kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma [KIRP]), endo-
crine (thyroid carcinoma [THCA] and adrenocortical carcinoma
[ACC]), core gastrointestinal (esophageal carcinoma [ESCA],
stomach
adenocarcinoma
[STAD],
colon
adenocarcinoma
[COAD], and rectum adenocarcinoma [READ]), developmental
gastrointestinal (liver hepatocellular carcinoma [LIHC], pancreatic
adenocarcinoma[PAAD],andcholangiocarcinoma[CHOL]),head
and neck (head and neck squamous cell carcinoma [HNSC]), and
thoracic (lung adenocarcinoma [LUAD], lungsquamouscellcarci-
noma [LUSC], and mesothelioma [MESO]) organ systems. Can-
cers of the central nervous system (glioblastoma multiforme
[GBM] and brain lower-grade glioma [LGG]) and soft tissue (sar-
coma [SARC] and uterine carcinosarcoma [UCS]) were repre-
sented, as were cancers from neural-crest-derived tissues,
such as pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (PCPG), and
melanocytic cancers of the skin (skin cutaneous melanoma
[SKCM]) and eye (uveal melanoma [UVM]). (For a complete list
of the TCGA cancer-type abbreviations, please see https://

study-abbreviations.)
Clustering by Individual Platforms
We explored the sample groupings from each individual
assay platform. Using aneuploidy (AN), CpG hypermethylation
(METH), mRNA (MRNA), miRNA (MIR), and protein (P), the resul-
tant number of groups ranged from 10 to 25 (Figure 1). While
cell-of-origin was a dominant feature of the classification, we
observed tumors from different cancer types grouping and
samples within a cancer type dispersing across groups.
Hierarchical clustering of 10,522 samples by chromosome
arm-level aneuploidy yielded ten groups (Figure 1A; Table S1).
Samples were split mainly by those with few alterations (AN7),
those with moderate alterations (AN6,8-10), and those with many
alterations (AN1-5). Over one-third of the samples displayed rela-
tively sparse aneuploidy in AN7; these were enriched for THCA,
LAML, PRAD, and THYM. We observed more distinct clustering
by cell-of-origin among higher-aneuploid tumors. For example,
AN2, characterized by chromosome (chr) 13 gain and chr18 loss,
was strongly enriched for gastrointestinal tumors (COAD, READ,
and STAD), and chromosomal instability (CIN) ESCA. Consistent
with previous results (Hoadley et al., 2014), squamous (lung,
head and neck, and esophageal) tumors clustered together by
aneuploidy patterns, particularly 3p loss and 3q gain (AN3).
Unsupervised clustering of 10,814 tumors using DNA methyl-
ation data with 3,139 CpG sites that were hypermethylated in at
least one tumor type identified 25 groups. Despite the exclusion
of loci known to be involved in tissue-specific DNA methylation,
tumors originating from the same organ often aggregated by
cancer-type-specific hypermethylation (Figure 1B; Table S2).
This result suggests that cancer-associated DNA hyper-
methylation in human cancers is influenced by pre-existing
cell-type-specific chromatin marks or transcriptional programs,
and not just by cell-type-specific DNA methylation patterns.
Tumors within an organ system tended to co-cluster. Consis-
tent with the aneuploidy analysis, squamous cell carcinomas

 (HNSC, ESCA, LUSC, and CESC) associated closely in METH2
and METH3. Gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas (ESCA, STAD,
COAD and READ) were represented in a branch containing
METH10 through METH13.
Unsupervised consensus clustering of 10,165 tumors by
mRNA expression profiles identified 25 groups that contained
at least 40 samples (Figure 1C; Table S3). While tumor type
was a driving feature for many groups, several groups were
comprised of tumors from different organ types. Samples with
squamous morphology components (BLCA, CESC, ESCA,
HNSC, and LUSC) grouped together. Similarly, tumors with
tissue
or
organ
similarities
or
proximity
also
grouped
together. These included neuroendocrine and glioma tumors
(GBM, LGG and PCPG), melanomas of the skin and eye
(SKCM and UVM), clear cell and papillary renal carcinomas
(KIRC and KIRP), adrenal cortical and chromophobe renal
(ACC and KICH), hepatocellular and cholangiocarcinomas
(LIHC and CHOL), a gastrointestinal group (COAD, READ,
non-squamous ESCA, READ, and STAD), a digestive system
group (PAAD, STAD, and a few ESCA), hematologic and
lymphatic cancers (LAML, DLBC, and THYM), and two mixed
lung cancer groups (LUAD and LUSC).

 Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of miRNA expression
profiles from 10,170 tumors yielded 15 groups (Figure 1D;
Table S4). While six groups contained only a single cancer type,
the remaining nine groups each represented a mix of cancer
types. These included a squamous-enriched group (MIR2), a
pan-kidney group (MIR11), and a pan-GI-enriched group (MIR6).
Hierarchical clustering of protein expression data from
7,858 samples across 32 tumor types (LAML did not have
protein data) revealed ten distinct protein (P) groups (Figure 1E;
Table S5). P1 (GBM, LGG) and P2 (DLBC, SARC, PCPG, UCS,
THYM, and metastatic SKCM) were distinguished from the
remaining 8 groups, largely corresponding to mesenchymal-
like tumor types with high EMT signatures. Similar to the other
individual data platforms, samples from related organ systems
grouped together: luminal breast and gynecologic cancers
(BRCA-Luminal, UCEC, and OV), plus some liver samples
(LIHC) with high levels of ER-alpha, AR and IGFBP2 comprised
the majority of the P3 and P4 groups. In addition, a pan-kidney
(P6) and a pan-GI (P8) group were identified.
Integrative Clustering across Data Types
We used clustering of cluster assignments (COCA) algorithm
(Hoadley et al., 2014) to assess the overlap of platform-specific
memberships from each of the five molecular platforms (aneu-
ploidy, mRNA, miRNA, DNA methylation, and RPPA) (Figure 2A).
Many samples similarly grouped together by multiple platform-
specific cluster memberships, both in groups that were defined
by a single tumor type and in tumor types that co-clustered,
such
as
KIRC
and
KIRP
(pan-kidney).
Gastrointestinal
tumors (COAD, READ, STAD, and ESCA adenocarcinomas)
co-clustered in the mRNA, miRNA, and RPPA platforms but
were represented by several distinct DNA methylation clusters.
Squamous histology cancers (LUSC, HNSC, CESC, ESCA, and
BLCA) were similarly classified by the miRNA, mRNA and
RPPA data but were further divided by the aneuploidy and
DNA methylation data. Within pan-gyn cancers (BRCA, OV,
UCEC, and UCS), RPPA data suggested that ovarian serous
cystadenocarcinoma (OV) and UCEC (and ER+ LIHC) shared
similarities at the protein level, whereas miRNA, mRNA, and
DNA methylation data were grouped by their organ sites. Also
of note, 13% of BRCA formed a subtype distinct from the major-
ity of other BRCA, influenced by the mRNA and DNA methylation
platforms.
While COCA showed high consistency across most data plat-
forms, we found less concordance for aneuploidy, where more
than a third of the samples were defined by few to no aneuploidy
events. This group, AN7, included almost all the THCA and LAML
samples, while not well defined by aneuploidy had strong
concordance among the other data platforms. COCA is less
powerful when the molecular patterns are not strong enough to
specify a distinct group on multiple individual platforms. To com-
plement this analysis, we explored joint clustering across all plat-
forms simultaneously.
We performed integrative molecular subtyping with iCluster
using the four most complete data types (copy number, DNA
methylation, mRNA, and miRNA) across 9,759 tumor samples,
identifying 28 iClusters (Figure 2B; Table S6). The relative contri-
bution of each platform to the overall clustering was quantified
by summing the different platform feature weights on the iCluster
latent variables. Copy-number alterations contributed 47% to
the overall integrated clustering results, followed by the tran-
scriptome (mRNA and miRNA) at 42%, and DNA methylation
at 11%.
For 16 of the tumor types, over 80% of samples grouped
together in the same iCluster. Eight iClusters were dominated by
a single tumor type (C24:LAML, C11:LGG [IDH1 mut], C6:OV,
C8:UCEC, C12:THCA, C16:PRAD, C26:LIHC, C14:LUAD). Others
contained tumors from similar or related cells or tissues: C28:pan-
kidney (KIRC, KIRP), C15:SKCM/UVM-melanoma of the skin
(SKCM) and eye (UVM), C23:GBM/LGG (IDH1wt), and C5:CNS/
endocrine. Six tumor types had more diverse iCluster member-
ship, with less than 50% of tumors represented in a given iCluster
(BLCA, UCS, HNSC, ESCA, STAD, and CHOL).
The pan-GI cohort separated into three iClusters (C1, C4, and
C18), primarily driven by differences in DNA methylation
profiles. C1:STAD (Epstein-Barr virus [EBV]-CIMP) consisted
of hypermethylated EBV-associated tumors, and C18:pan-GI
(MSI) consisted mostly of microsatellite instability (MSI) tumors
of STAD and COAD. C4:pan-GI (CRC) was predominantly
COAD and READ with chromosomal instability (CIN) and a
distinct aneuploidy profile (Figure 2B). The pan-squamous
cohort formed three iClusters (C10, C25, and C27). The
majority of LUSC fell into C10:pan-SCC, and nearly all CESC
fell into C27:pan-SCC (human papillomavirus [HPV]). Even
though all squamous iClusters were characterized by chromo-
some 3q amplification, unique features defined C10:pan-SCC
(9p deletion) and C25:pan-SCC (Chr11 amp) (Figure 2B).
Among mixed tumor type iClusters, three were defined
by copy-number alterations. C7:mixed was characterized by
chr9 deletion, C2:BRCA (HER2 amp) mainly consisted of
ERBB2-amplified tumors (BRCA, BLCA, and STAD), and
C13:mixed (Chr8 del) contained highly aneuploid tumors,
including a mixture of BRCA-Basal, UCEC (CN-high subtype),
UCS, and BLCA. C3 and C20 were defined by their non-tumor-
cell components including immune and stromal features.
We explored the non-tumor components of the iClusters in
more detail. We estimated the stromal fraction as 1 minus tumor
purity and the leukocyte fraction based on DNA methylation (Fig-
ure 3). C20 had the highest median stromal fraction followed by
C14:LUAD, C10:pan-SCC, and C3 (Figure 3A). Each of these
iClusters also displayed elevated leukocyte fractions (Figure 3B).
To estimate how much of the stromal fraction was due to im-
mune cell infiltration, we plotted the stromal fraction versus the
leukocyte fraction (Figure 3C). In C3, more of the stromal fraction
was defined by leukocytes than in C20. C3 contained predomi-
nately mesenchymal cancers, which we labeled C3:mesen-
chymal (immune). C20 tumors were predominately mixed epithe-
lial cancers, which we labeled C20:mixed (stromal/immune).
To characterize composition and relative homogeneity of each
iCluster, we computed the dominant-cancer-type proportion
within each iCluster and plotted it against the mean iCluster
silhouette width, a measure of within-group homogeneity (Fig-
ure 2C). The silhouette widths ranged from �0.05 to 0.59,
with the highest silhouette widths belonging to single-cancer-
type-dominant iClusters (C11:LGG [IDH1 mut], C12:THCA,
C16:PRAD, and C24:LAML). Interestingly, 6 of the 7 pan-organ
294
Cell 173, 291–304, April 5, 2018
 system iClusters (pan-GI: C1, C4, C18; pan-SCC: C25, C27, and
pan-kidney: C28) had similar ranges of silhouette widths to those
of single cancer-type dominant iClusters, suggesting that these
were as robust as the cancer-type-dominant iClusters. iClusters
driven by a shared specific chromosomal alteration (e.g.,
C13:mixed [chr8 del]) tended to compose multiple tumor types
and appeared to have among the lowest silhouette widths,
suggesting substantial molecular heterogeneity.
We used a Sankey diagram to further visualize the relationship
between the iCluster classification, cancer types, and organ sys-
tems (Figure 2D). Pan-kidney mapped almost entirely to C28,
except for KICH, which grouped with ACC in C9, characterized

Cancer Types
(A) COCA clusters. Membership for individual clusters for each of the five molecular platforms—aneuploidy (AN), methylation (Meth), miRNA expression (miR),
mRNA, and RPPA—is displayed as a separate binary membership variable in a distinct row. For the mRNA platform, only clusters containing >40 samples were
considered. Samples are labeled for membership of each platform-specific cluster (red, member; white, non-member; gray, not evaluated on the platform). Order
of samples and platform-specific clusters were determined by hierarchical clustering using a binary distance matrix and average linkage. Column annotation
shows cancer type and tissue organ systems of each sample; row annotations reflect the platform for each classification (bright pink, AN; purple, Meth; light
turquoise, miR; dark turquoise, mRNA; orange, RPPA).
(B) iCluster. Data used for integrated analysis of iClusters. RPPA data are also included in the heatmap to visualize proteomic patterns across the integrated
clusters.
(C) iCluster robustness versus composition. Pie charts show the cancer-type composition within each iCluster and the size is proportional to the membership
size. The cancer type accounting for the highest proportion of members within the iCluster was considered the dominant cancer type. The y coordinate of each pie
center reflects this dominant cancer-type proportion; the x coordinate was determined by the iCluster silhouette width.
(D) Relationship of TCGA tumor type, iCluster, and Pan-Organ system. The Sankey diagram demonstrates the tumor-type composition of each iCluster. The pan-
cancer designations are shown on the right.

 by a high frequency of hypodiploid samples (Davis et al., 2014;
Zheng et al., 2016). However, pan-GI, pan-gyn, and pan-squa-
mous were distributed among multiple iClusters. C20:mixed
(stromal/immune) was fairly heterogeneous, including pan-GI,
pan-gyn, and pan-squamous. Pan-gyn and pan-squamous
overlapped, as cervical cancer is primarily a squamous cell
carcinoma. This analysis demonstrated that the iClusters were
strongly influenced by the cell type of origin for the individual
cancers, though this relationship was not absolute.
Tumor Maps of Organ Systems
We visualized the samples by calculating Euclidean distances
between the iCluster latent variables for all sample pairs and pro-
jecting the distances onto a 2D layout with TumorMap (Figure 4A;
Table S7) (Newton et al., 2017). We overlaid the tumor-type colors
to reveal that tumors systematically assembled along the major
organ systems (Figure 4B), lending further support for the or-
gan-systemgroups explored in accompanying papers (Figure 4C)

 et al., 2018; Ricketts et al., 2018). More subtle differences within
individual iClusters were apparent, potentially signifying impor-
tant distinctions from the dominant cell-of-origin-associated
signals. Kidney tumors separated into KICH, KIRC, and KIRP
(Ricketts et al., 2018), and CIMP kidney tumors were positioned
near the Pan-GI CIMP tumors, suggesting similarities driven
by DNA hypermethylation data (Figure 4D). Pan-gyn subtypes
displayed partial overlap (Berger et al., 2018) (Figure 4E). Pan-
gyn samples were broadly distributed, accounting for at least
5% of samples in 11 of the 28 iClusters. However, the majority
of cervical cancers fell into the squamous C27:pan-SCC (HPV)
with HPV-positive HNSC and BLCA, whereas other samples fell
primarily within C6:OV, C19:BRCA (luminal) and C8:UCEC,
reflecting their cell-of-origin and hormonal dependency (Berger
et al., 2018). The pan-GI tumors separated into distinct molecular
subtypes represented by MSI tumors, hypermutated-SNV tu-
mors, genome-stable tumors, CIN tumors, and EBV-associated
gastric cancers (Liu et al., 2018) (Figure 4F).
The TumorMap landscape showed that tumors with similar
pathologic classification tended to assemble together, even
though histopathologic information was not used in the map
generation (Figure 5A). This result underscores the influence

terns observed in cancer and provides
further support for the pan-squamous
sub-analysis (Campbell et al., 2018).
Immune-signaling subtypes identified in
Thorsson et al. (2018) also co-localized
on the TumorMap, indicating relation-
ships between the iClusters, histopathol-
ogy, and the types of immune infiltration
(Figure
5B).
Pan-squamous
tumors

Cancer stemness has been proposed
as a possible mechanism for treatment
resistance and as a driver of the ability
of subpopulations to repopulate new
metastatic niches (Jin et al., 2017). Two stemness indices (Malta
et al., 2018), based on mRNA expression and on DNA methyl-
ation data, revealed aggregation of high stemness tumors
across distinct regions of the TumorMap (Figures 5C and 5D).
TGCT showed strong enrichment of both signatures while
others, such as LAML, showed strong enrichment only for the
mRNA-based signature.
Mutational Assessment of iClusters
We did not use tumor mutation data in generating iClusters due
to sparsity of mutations; however, we did use mutational burden
and signatures for characterization. Overall somatic mutation
burden varied among iClusters. Melanomas and lung adenocar-
cinomas have been shown to have relatively high mutation rates,
and we observed similar results with C15:SKCM/UVM and
C14:LUAD (Lawrence et al., 2013). Pan-GI and pan-squamous
were also associated with overall higher somatic mutational
burdens (Figure 6A). Mutation frequencies varied widely within
the two iClusters with the most diverse tumor compositions:
C3:mesenchymal (immune) and C20:mixed (stromal/immune).
Mutational signatures (Covington et al., 2016) also varied
among iClusters. Expected signatures were apparent, such as
298

 enrichment for UVB signatures in C15:SKCM/UVM, smoking in
C14:LUAD, and POLE mutation in hypermutated samples of
C8:UCEC and C4:pan-GI (CRC) (Figure 6B). We also found
enhanced signatures in a few of our pan-organ groups such as
C18:pan-GI (MSI), which showed enrichment of known (CpG,
toxins) and unknown mutational signatures, some of which are
likely related to the high proportion of mismatch-repair deficient
tumors in this group (Figure 6B).

However, KICH co-clustered with ACC
in C9:ACC/KICH, lacking hypoxic and
immune signals and showing low activity
in nearly all pathways. Both these tumor
types have previously been characterized
as hypodiploid (Davis et al., 2014; Zheng
et al., 2016).
Despite having very different cancer
type compositions, the pan-squamous
iClusters C10:pan-SCC,
C25:pan-SCC
(chr11 amp), and C27:pan-SCC (HPV)
shared many pathway characteristics. All
had high levels of squamous-cell-related
signaling (dNp63 and TAp63 complexes
and GP6), proliferation-related pathways,
relatively high hypoxia, immune-related
signaling, and high basal signaling.

the

iClusters
C1:STAD (EBV-CIMP), C4:pan-GI (CRC),
and
C18:pan-GI
(MSI)
shared
some
common characteristics such as relatively high proliferation
signaling, these iClusters diverged in some respects. Immune-
related
signaling
was
high
in C1:STAD
(EBV-CIMP)
and
C18:pan-GI (MSI), but not in C4:pan-GI (CRC). In addition,
C20:mixed (stromal/immune) contained 32% Pan-GI samples
and also displayed strong immune-related signaling. Beta-cate-
nin/cell-cell adhesion signaling appeared high in C4:pan-GI
(CRC), C18:pan-GI (MSI), and C20:mixed (stromal/immune),
but not in the smaller C1:STAD (EBV-CIMP).
Most UCS co-clustered with a subset of Basal BRCA, UCEC
and BLCA in C13:mixed (chr8 del), with high basal signaling
and proliferation in the absence of immune activation. Interest-
ingly, another subset of Basal breast cancers co-clustered with
squamous cancers in the C20:mixed (stromal/immune), which
also had high basal signaling and proliferation, but activated
immune signaling. OV and UCEC shared a number of pathway
similarities with cervical cancers and a subset of Basal breast
cancers despite falling into different iClusters. These similarities
included high proliferation and DNA repair pathways and basal

was very high in the breast cancer iClusters C2:BRCA (HER2
amp) and C19:BRCA (luminal), that program did not appear to
be high in the other gynecological cancers.
DISCUSSION
With nearly three times more tumors and tumor types profiled in
this PanCancer Atlas analysis, we were able to detect more
integrated molecular subtypes than we had reported in the
original Pan-Cancer-12 analysis (Hoadley et al., 2014). We first
performed
unsupervised
consensus
clustering
of
tumor
profiles from each of the 5 platforms, revealing from 10 to 25
platform-specific molecular subsets within �10,000 tumors,
each showing significant compositional heterogeneity based
on classical tumor taxonomy (Figure 1). Aneuploidy classifica-
tions were weakly consistent with other classifications, in
part due to low numbers of arm-level copy-number events in
one-third of the tumors. We explored cross-platform cluster
relationships using COCA and employed iCluster to integrate
the multiplatform molecular data simultaneously into a final
28-cluster solution.
While a third of iClusters were mostly homogeneous for a single
tumor type, the other two-thirds showed varying degrees of
heterogeneity. The most diverse group, C20:mixed (stromal/
immune), contained a remarkable 25 tumor types (Figures 2C
and 2D). Most of the heterogeneous iClusters, including
C20:mixed (stromal/immune), contained tumor types that fell
within four major cell-of-origin, or organ system, patterns (Fig-
ure 2D): pan-GI, pan-gyn, pan-squamous, and pan-kidney.
Individual cluster assignments, COCA, and iCluster-determined
molecular subsets were concordant, and confirmed the multi-
platform co-clustering of different kidney malignancies (pan-
kidney), various gastrointestinal malignancies (pan-GI), diverse
squamous cell malignancies (pan-squamous) and most gyneco-
logical malignancies (pan-gyn) into molecular subgroups, each
with subordinate platform-specific subsets (Figure 2A). Conse-
quently, these four major cell-of-origin patterns are the subject
of
separate
in-depth
reports
detailing
their
distinguishing
genomic and molecular features (Berger et al., 2018; Campbell
et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2018; Malta et al., 2018; Ricketts et al.,
2018). These iCluster assignments have potential clinical utility,
and their multi-platform basis suggests that this new subclassifi-
cation system might further improve the management of the
1%–3% of all cancer patients newly diagnosed with cancer of un-
known primary (CUP). Using either RNA (Hainsworth et al., 2013)
or DNA methylation (Moran et al., 2016) profiling has recently led
to improved patient outcomes by better defining the tissues of
origin for this diverse group of life-threatening malignancies.
While separate spatial co-localization of the four major cell-of-
origin patterns was generally evident in the TumorMap visualiza-
tion (Figure 4), heterogeneity was also apparent between sub-
sets within these individual iClusters, even those with generally
similar tumor type, organ system, and histopathology. This indi-
cates that while iCluster groupings were strongly influenced by
organ and cell-of-origin patterns, this influence did not fully
determine their molecular groupings such as seen in our largest
and most heterogeneous iCluster, C20:mixed (stromal/immune),
which contained 25 of our 33 tumor types. The spatial relation-
ships of C20:mixed (stromal/immune) tumors to C10:pan-SCC
and C13:mixed (chr8 del) tumors may be determined in part by
their different mRNA and DNA methylation-based stemness sig-
natures (Figures 5C and 5D).
Interrogation of individual iClusters for their differentiating
PARADIGM pathway features, canonical pathways, and gene
programs amenable to drug targeting identified strong immune-
related signaling features for both C3:mesenchymal (immune)
and
C20:mixed
(stromal/immune)
tumors,
suggesting
that
they may share potential susceptibility to immunotherapy. We
noted that C20:mixed (stromal/immune) and C3:mesenchymal
(immune) tumors were commonly enriched for gene programs
representing PD1, CTLA4, and GP2-T cell/B cell activation (Fig-
ure 7B), indicating that new therapies targeting these specific
immune pathways might be appropriate. Another potentially clin-
ically relevant similarity was upregulation of different druggable
growth factor signaling pathways (Figure 7B). In particular, our
PARADIGM analysis showed that C3:mesenchymal (immune)
and C20:mixed (stromal/immune) tumors shared upregulated
JAK2/STAT1,3,6
signaling
with
C14:LUAD
tumors
and
C10:pan-SCC, pointing to the possibility of treating these diverse
iCluster tumors with JAK-STAT agents currently approved to
treat rheumatoid arthritis, myelofibrosis, polycythemia vera, and
other non-malignant diseases (Banerjee et al., 2017).
Compared
to
the
seemingly
discohesive
groupings
of
the 17 heterogeneous iClusters, the 11 most homogeneous
iClusters (C6:OV, C8:UCEC, C11:LGG [IDH1 mut], C12:THCA,
C14:LUAD, C15:SKCM/UVM, C16:PRAD, C19:BRCA [luminal],
C21:DLBC, C24:LAML, C26:LIHC) had higher silhouette widths,
uniform tumor types, and histopathologies, but showed surpris-
ing degrees of spatial discohesion in the TumorMap. These
anatomically homogeneous iClusters also showed mixed types
of immune infiltration and variable degrees of stemness, attest-
ing to their underlying molecular heterogeneity, as previously
reported (Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2015; Cancer Genome
Atlas Research Network, 2011, 2012, 2014a, 2014b, 2015a,
2015b, 2017; Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network et al.,
2013a, 2013b; Robertson et al., 2017).
While malignancies arising from the same anatomical site
have traditionally been treated clinically as a single entity,
histologic and molecular sub-classifications are now routinely
used to determine treatments for subtypes of lung, breast,
gastrointestinal, skin and bone marrow derived malignancies.
As drugs become increasingly clinically available to target
such cancer-driving pathway targets as ALK, EGFR, ERBB2,
ERa, KIT, BRAF, and ABL1, the traditional system of anatomic
cancer classification should be supplemented by a classifica-
tion system based on molecular alterations shared by tumors
across different tissue types (Hoadley et al., 2014; Saunders
et al., 2012). This concept has led to the development of so-
called basket or umbrella trials, such as the NCI-MATCH study,
to investigate the feasibility and validity of this new clinical
approach (Ramos et al., 2015). However, exceptions that chal-
lenge this concept have also become apparent from such
notable examples as the unpredictable clinical responses to a
potent
BRAF
inhibitor
across
diverse
malignancies
all
expressing the same BRAF mutation (Saunders et al., 2012).
Cell 173, 291–304, April 5, 2018

 Integrated molecular tumor profiling such as described here,
and in our previous Pan-Cancer-12 analysis, may improve
basket-trial
design
by
considering
both
mutations
and
oncogenic signaling pathways along with consideration of
each tumor’s tissue-specific or cell-of-origin context (Hoadley
et al., 2014).

 EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Human Subjects
Tumor tissue, adjacent normal tissue, and normal whole blood samples were obtained from patients at contributing centers with
informed consent according to their local Institutional Review Boards (IRBs, see below). Biospecimens were centrally processed
and DNA, RNA, and protein were distributed to TCGA analysis centers.
TCGA Project Management has collected necessary human subjects documentation to ensure the project complies with 45-CFR-46
(the ‘‘Common Rule’’). The program has obtained documentation from every contributing clinical site to verify that IRB approval has
been obtained to participate in TCGA. Such documented approval may include one or more of the following:
d An IRB-approved protocol with Informed Consent specific to TCGA or a substantially similar program. In the latter case, if the
protocol was not TCGA-specific, the clinical site PI provided a further finding from the IRB that the already-approved protocol is
sufficient to participate in TCGA.
d A TCGA-specific IRB waiver has been granted.
d A TCGA-specific letter that the IRB considers one of the exemptions in 45-CFR-46 applicable. The two most common
exemptions cited were that the research falls under 46.102(f)(2) or 46.101(b)(4). Both exempt requirements for informed
consent, because the received data and material do not contain directly identifiable private information.
d A TCGA-specific letter that the IRB does not consider the use of these data and materials to be human subjects research. This
was most common for collections in which the donors were deceased.
A total of 11,188 patients were analyzed in TCGA with at least one molecular-profiling platform. This study contained both males
and females with inclusions of genders dependent on tumor types. There were 5,769 females, 5,282 males and 137 missing infor-
mation about gender. TCGA’s goal was to characterize adult human tumors; therefore, the vast majority are over the age of 18. How-
ever, there are 20 samples that are under the age of 18 that had tissue submitted prior to clinical data. Age was missing for 188 pa-
tients. The range of ages was 10 – 90 (maxed 90 for protection of human subjects) with a median age of diagnosis of 60 years of age.
METHOD DETAILS
Sample Processing
RNA and DNA were extracted from tumor and adjacent normal tissue specimens using a modification of the DNA/RNA AllPrep kit
(QIAGEN). The flow-through from the QIAGEN DNA column was processed using a mirVana miRNA Isolation Kit (Ambion). This latter
step generated RNA preparations that included RNA < 200 nt suitable for miRNA analysis. DNA was extracted from blood using the
QiaAmp Blood Midi Kit (QIAGEN). Each specimen was quantified by measuring Abs260 with a UV spectrophotometer or by
PicoGreen assay. DNA specimens were resolved by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis to confirm high molecular weight fragments.
A custom Sequenom SNP panel or the AmpFISTR Identifiler (Applied Biosystems) was utilized to verify that tumor DNA and germline
DNA were derived from the same patient. Five hundred nanograms of each tumor and normal DNA were sent to QIAGEN for REPLI-g
whole genome amplification using a 100 mg reaction scale. Only specimens yielding a minimum of 6.9 mg of tumor DNA, 5.15 mg RNA,
and 4.9 mg of germline DNA were included in this study. RNA was analyzed via the RNA6000 Nano assay (Agilent) for determination of
an RNA Integrity Number (RIN), and only the cases with RIN > 7.0 were included in this study.
Pathology Review
Samples were systematically evaluated by pathologists to confirm the histopathologic diagnosis and any variant histology, using the
criteria of the most recent edition of the WHO / IARC Classification of Tumors relevant to each cancer type. All tumor samples were
assessed for tumor content (percent tumor nuclei). Any non-concordant diagnoses among the pathologists were re-reviewed and
resolution achieved after discussion.
Somatic Copy-Number Alterations
Somatic copy-number data were generated on Affymetrix SNP 6.0 arrays using standard protocols from the Genome Analysis
Platform of the Broad Institute (McCarroll et al., 2008). Briefly, preliminary copy number at each probe locus was inferred by Birdseed
analysis of raw .CEL files (Korn et al., 2008). Tangent normalization was then used to further refine genome-wide copy-number
estimates (https://www.broadinstitute.org/cancer/cga/copynumber_pipeline). Segmented copy-number data were generated using
Circular Binary Segmentation (Olshen et al., 2004). Regions corresponding to germline copy-number alterations were removed by
applying filters generated from normal samples. Gene-level copy number was generated by GISTIC 2.0 analysis (Mermel et al.,
2011). Purity and ploidy estimates were calculated using ABSOLUTE (Carter et al., 2012).
Chromosome arm-level copy-number calls were determined by clustering breakpoint locations and fraction of arm altered (further
detailed in Taylor et al., 2018). Hierarchical clustering was performed using a metric of Manhattan distance and Ward2 methods for
10,522 samples; this analysis identified 10 groups (Figure 1A). Aneuploidy scores reflect the overall aneuploidy burden, and the range
varied across tumor types. Most AN groups represented a mix of tumor types; however, tumor types with specific aneuploidy
e2
Cell 173, 291–304.e1–e6, April 5, 2018
 patterns defined unique groups like AN9 enriched with GBM, characterized by chr7 gain and chr10 loss, and AN10 enriched for
TGCT, which all displayed chromosome ploidies greater than 2.
Cervical squamous tumors clustered in high aneuploidy clusters AN1 and AN5. These clusters were also enriched for other
Pan-gyn tumors, including ovarian, high-copy number endometrial, and uterine carcinosarcoma (Cherniack et al., 2017).
Gynecologic tumors with fewer copy-number alterations including Luminal breast cancers and other endometrial tumors grouped
separately in low aneuploidy clusters AN7 and AN8, respectively.
DNA methylation
Illumina Infinium DNA methylation arrays were used to obtain DNA methylation profiles of 10,814 tumors from 33 tumor types and
1,064 histologically normal tumor-adjacent tissue specimens representing 24 different tissue types. Data from two generations of
Infinium arrays, HumanMethylation27 (HM27) and HumanMethylation450 (HM450), were merged to generate a dataset for 22,601
probes shared between two platforms. To minimize systematic platform-specific effects, we normalized the HM27 data against
the HM450 data using a probe-by-probe proportional rescaling method. During data generation, a single technical replicate of the
same cell line control sample from either of two different DNA extractions (TCGA-07-0227/TCGA-AV-A03D) was included on each
plate as a control, and measured 44/198 times and 12/169 times on HM27 and HM450, respectively. These repeated-measurements
were therefore used for rescaling of the HM27 data to be comparable to HM450. For each probe within each platform, we computed
the median b-value across all technical replicates of each of the two TCGA IDs. We then combined the two extractions by taking the
mean of the two medians obtained for each of the two replicate TCGA IDs, and obtained a single summarized DNA methylation
readout (b-value) for the corresponding probe i for each platform, noted as Betahm27,i, and Betahm450,i, respectively. We then applied
a constrained (within the range of 0 to 1 for b-values) linear rescaling of the HM27 data for each probe and for each patient’s sample
using Betahm27,i and Betahm450,i. When the HM27 b-value of a patient’s sample j for probe i was smaller than the mean of median
replicate samples on the HM27 for that probe, we linearly rescaled the HM27 b-value Betahm27,i,j in the (0, Betahm27,i,j) space; and
when Betahm27,i,j was greater, we linearly rescaled the HM27 beta value Betahm27,i,j in the (Betahm27,i,j, 1) space; This translates
into the following mathematical computation: Beta hm450,i,j = Betahm27,i,j*(Betahm450,i/Betahm27,i), if Betahm27,i,j < Betahm27,i ; and
Beta hm450,i,j = 1-(1- Betahm27,i,j)*((1- Betahm450,i)/(1- Betahm27,i)), if Betahm27,i,j > Betahm27,i. After the between-platform normalization,
we further excluded 779 probes that still showed a consistent platform difference (mean b-value difference greater than or equal
to 0.1) in six or more tumor types.
Unsupervised clustering was performed based on promoter CpG sites that did not exhibit tissue-specific DNA methylation, but that
acquired hypermethylation in cancer. We used DNA methylation data from the histologically normal tissues and leukocytes to identify
11,275 sites that lacked tissue-specific DNA methylation (mean b-value < 0.2 in any tissue type and b-value > 0.3 in no more than five
samples across the entire set). To minimize the influence of variable tumor purity levels on a clustering result, we dichotomized the
data using a b-value of R 0.3 to define positive DNA methylation and < 0.3 to specify lack of methylation. The dichotomization not
only ameliorated the effect of tumor sample purity on the clustering, but also removed a great portion of residual batch/platform
effects that are mostly reflected in small variations near the two ends of the range of b-values. For clustering analysis of tumors,
we selected 3,139 CpG sites that were methylated at a b-value of R 0.3 in more than 10% of tumors within any of the 33 cancer types.
We performed unsupervised clustering of 10,814 tumors using hierarchical clustering with Ward’s method to cluster the distance
matrix computed with the Jaccard index. The dendrogram was cut at different levels, and resulting clusters were evaluated for
associations with tumor types and subtypes. The heatmap was generated using the original b-values for the top one-third
(n = 1,035) of the most variability methylated CpGs across tumors (Figure 1B). We chose 25 clusters for the subsequent cross-
platform analyses. We noted that a fraction of ESCA and STAD was found in METH9 with LUAD and PAAD, a result that may be
related to the low tumor cellularity of the cancers in this cluster. Three types of renal cell carcinomas, including KIRC, (KIRP and
KICH, aligned together in METH19, which interestingly also included THYM and THCA. Pan-GYN tumors separated into three major
groups, which appeared to reflect molecular subtypes within each tumor type. Luminal and HER2 breast (BRCA-Luminal) and
subtypes of UCEC lacking CIN organized into METH 4, 5 and 6. OV and UCEC with CIN-high grouped together in METH 22 and
23. Finally, Basal-like BRCA was found in METH 24 and 25.
RNA Data Batch Correction
The expression data for mRNA and miRNA were batch-corrected to adjust for platform differences between the GAII and HiSeq
Illumina sequencers. For mRNA, additional adjustments were made for different sequencing centers (The University of North
Carolina [UNC] and British Columbia Cancer Agency [BCCA]) and a plate effect observed in PRAD. For the mRNA data, first batch
312 and 320 PRAD were adjusted to remove batch effects. UNC GA samples (UCEC, COAD, READ) were adjusted to the UNC
HiSeq data. Genes with mostly zero reads or with residual batch effects (�10% of genes) were removed from the adjusted
samples and replaced with NAs. A similar adjustment was made for BCCA GAII-sequenced samples (LAML, STAD, ESCA) to
HiSeq. Genes were adjusted using a novel algorithm called EB++; a variant of the Empirical Bayes / ComBat algorithm with
training and testing features added.
The miRNA data were batch-corrected for GAII and HiSeq, as well as for two library construction protocols (MultiMACS and Direct).
Weakly expressed miRNAs were filtered by requiring miRNA mature strands to be expressed with an RPM of at least 10 in 10% of
primary tumors in each TCGA project resulting in 743 miRNAs across all 32 projects (miRNA sequencing was not performed on GBM).

 The EB++ method was used to correct the Direct protocol to the MultiMACs protocol and the GAII to the HiSeq protocol similar to
what was done for mRNA.
mRNA
Upper quartile normalized RSEM data for batch-corrected mRNA gene expression were used for analysis. The matrix was filtered for
genes expressed in 60% or more of the samples. Unsupervised consensus clustering using Consensus Cluster Plus (Wilkerson and
Hayes, 2010) was performed on 10,165 tumors with 15,363 genes. At K = 43, we identified 25 major groups with at least 40 samples
per group (Figure 1C). Many of the sample groups contained > 90% of a single tumor type or subtype. These included OV, PRAD,
THCA, BRCA-Luminal, BRCA-Basal, LUAD, BLCA, CESC, UCEC, MESO, and TGCT. As observed in our previous publication
(Hoadley et al., 2014), Basal-like breast cancer split out as a separate group from the estrogen receptor (ER)-positive and HER2-
positive breast cancers.
miRNA
We analyzed batch-corrected, normalized abundance (i.e., reads per million, RPM) data for 743 expressed mature strands (of 1212
miRBase v16 strands). The data matrix contained abundance profiles for 10,170 tumor samples. We hierarchically clustered the
data matrix with the pheatmap R package, using row-scaling, Pearson correlation coefficients for a distance metric, and ward.D2
clustering.
Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of batch-corrected miRNA mature-strand expression profiles from 10,170 tumors yielded a
15-group solution (Figure 1D). We observed six tumor-type-specific clusters. MIR5 contained OV, MIR8 BRCA, MIR12 LGG, MIR13
LIHC, MIR14 THCA, and MIR15 PRAD. Two clusters contained samples from two diseases. MIR7 contained two blood cancers:
DLBC and LAML, while MIR10 contained two types of melanomas: SKCM and UVM. MIR11 contained only the three kidney tumors:
KICH, KIRC and KIRP.
Each of the remaining 6 clusters contained at least four cancer types. MIR1 was largely UCEC, with substantial BRCA and BLCA,
plus smaller numbers of 6 other cancers. MIR2 contained predominantly squamous carcinomas including HNSC, LUSC, CESC and
BLCA, with smaller numbers of ESCA, LUAD, and minor BRCA and SARC. MIR3 contained largely PCPG, with SARC and ACC, and
smaller numbers of 8 other cancer types. MIR6, the Pan-GI group, was largely COAD and STAD, but also had substantial PAAD,
READ and ESCA, with smaller numbers of CHOL and LIHC. MIR4 was largely TGCT, with THYM and BLCA, with smaller numbers
of LIHC and SKCM. MIR9 was largely LUAD and SARC, with smaller numbers of MESO and LUSC.
Protein
Protein expression data were available for 7,858 samples from 32 of the 33 tumor types (LAML data were never generated) across
216 proteins and phosphoproteins. The data were generated using the reverse phase protein array (RPPA) platform. We used batch
effects-corrected RPPA data and median-centered them in both directions. We then clustered them using hierarchical clustering
from the R function hclust() with 1 – Pearson’s correlation coefficient as the distance metric and Ward as the linkage function. The
10 clusters were obtained by cutting the dendrogram using the cutree() function in R.
Hierarchical clustering of protein expression data revealed 10 distinct Protein (P) groups (Figure 1E). The dendrogram first
separated P1 and P2 from the remaining 8 clusters, which largely corresponded with the separation between mesenchymal-like
tumor types with high EMT signatures versus tumor types with low EMT signatures, respectively. Cluster 1 consisted of the brain
cancers (GBM, LGG), whereas cluster 2 contained DLBC, SARC, PCPG, UCS, THYM and metastatic SKCM. Those 2 clusters
were characterized by low levels of E-cadherin, EPPK1, RAB25 and Claudin 7. The brain cancers had high levels of PKC-alpha,
phosphoPKC-alpha, PKC-delta, ERK2, PEA15 and acetyl-A tubulin.
P3 and P4 consisted mainly of the Luminal breast and gynecologic cancers (BRCA-Lum8, UCEC7, OV), plus some liver samples
(LIHC). The clusters had high levels of ER-alpha, AR and IGFBP2. Interestingly, the LIHC samples in P4 had high levels of ER-alpha as
well, whereas those LIHC samples not in P4 had low ER-alpha levels. P6 was a Pan-kidney cluster with KIRC, KIRP and ACC and was
characterized by high levels of EMT based on low expression of the negative EMT markers E-cadherin, RAB25 and Claudin 7, as well
as low IGFBP2, FASN and Cyclin B1, and high GAPDH, CD26, and phosphoNDRG1. P8 was a Pan-GI cluster consisting of most of
the colorectal (COAD/READ) and gastric cancer (STAD) samples. In contrast to the Pan-kidney group, the Pan-GI group had a very
low EMT signature with high expression of RAB25, EPPK1 and Claudin 7. Other distinguishing features of the cluster included high
levels of cleaved CASPASE 7, TFRC, MYH11, TIGAR, and beta catenin. P9 and P10 were the most diverse and included some
samples from most of the tumor types. P10, in particular, had an enrichment of the squamous cancers with large proportions of
HNSC, LUSC, CESC, CHOL, and BLCA. This cluster had high levels of PAI1, cleaved CASPASE 7, ANNEXIN1, TFRC, P16INK4A,
ASNS, Cyclin B1, Cyclin E1, FASN and FOXM1.
Integrative clustering with iCluster
The iCluster clustering algorithm formulates the problem of subgroup discovery as a joint multivariate regression of multiple data
types with reference to a set of common latent variables, which represent the underlying 28 tumor subtypes (Mo et al., 2013;
Shen et al., 2009, 2012). Four molecular platforms - SCNA, DNA methylation, mRNA expression, and miRNA expression were
used as input. Data were pre-processed using the following procedures: For mRNA, and mature-strand miRNA sequence
e4

 data, poorly expressed genes were excluded based on median-normalized counts, and variance filtering led to a list of reduced
features for clustering. mRNA and miRNA expression features were log2 transformed, normalized and scaled before using them
as an input to iCluster. Pre-processing led to 3,217 mRNA and 382 miRNA features. Pre-processed DNA methylation data were
obtained from the methylation merged HM27 and HM450 platform datasets and included 3,139 hypermethylation features.
Circular Binary Segmented (CBS) SCNA data were further reduced to a set of 3,105 non-redundant regions as described
(Mo et al., 2013).
Cancer Immune Subtypes
To characterize the commonality and diversity of intratumoral immune states, we scored 160 published immune expression
signatures on all available TCGA PanCancerAtlas tumor samples, and performed cluster analysis to identify similarity modules
of multiple immune signature sets. The 160 immune expression signatures were selected based on extensive literature search,
utilizing diverse resources considered to be reliable and comprehensive, based on expert opinions of immuno-oncologists
(Thorsson et al., 2018). Eighty-three signatures were derived in the context of immune response studies in cancer, and the
remaining 77 are of general validity for immunity. TCGA RNA-seq values from the PanCancer Atlas normalized gene expression
matrix were scored for each of the 160 identified gene expression signatures using single-sample gene set enrichment (ssGSEA)
analysis, using the R package GSVA. Clusters of similar signature scores were identified by weighted gene correlation network
analysis (WGCNA) (Langfelder and Horvath, 2008). Based on the WGCNA analysis, five immuno-oncology-related immune
expression signatures: activation of macrophages/monocytes (Beck et al., 2009), overall lymphocyte infiltration (dominated by
T and B cells) (Calabro
` et al., 2009), TGF-b response (Teschendorff et al., 2010), IFN-g response (Wolf et al., 2014), and wound
healing (Chang et al., 2004), robustly reproduced co-clustering of the immune signature sets, and were selected to perform clus-
ter analysis of all cancer types, with the exception of hematologic neoplasias (acute myeloid leukemia, LAML; diffuse large B cell
lymphoma, DLBC; and thymoma, THYM). Clustering of tumor samples scored on these five signatures was performed using
model-based clustering, using the mclust R package (Scrucca et al., 2016), with the number of clusters, K, determined by maxi-
mization of Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). Maximal BIC was found with a six-cluster solution, and the six resulting clusters
C1-C6 (with 2416, 2591, 2397, 1157, 385 and 180 cases, respectively) were characterized by a distinct distribution of scores over
the five representative signatures, and effectively categorized each TCGA sample as belonging to one of six cancer ‘‘immune
subtypes,’’ namely Wound Healing (C1), IFN-g Dominant (C2), Inflammatory (C3), Lymphocyte Depleted (C4), Immunologically
Quiet (C5), or TGF-b Dominant (C6). Additional details are found in Thorsson et al. (2018). The designations C1-C6 of immune
subtypes were made independently from iCluster designations in the current work.
Leukocyte and Stromal Fraction Estimates
Overall leukocyte content in 10,814 TCGA tumor aliquots was assessed by identifying DNA methylation probes with the greatest
differences between pure leukocyte cells and normal tissue, then estimating leukocyte content using a mixture model. From Illumina
Infinium DNA methylation platform arrays HumanMethylation450, 2000 loci were identified (200 for HumanMethylation27) that
were the most differentially methylated between leukocyte and normal tissues, 1000 in each direction. For each locus i, assuming
two populations (j), for each sample we have the following equation:
bi =
X
2
j = 1
bijpj:
Using the tumor with the least evidence of leukocyte methylation as a surrogate for the beta value (b) for each locus in the pure tumor,
2000 estimates were made, solving for p. We took the mode of 200 estimates to avoid loci that violate the assumptions. Using the
estimated p and the measured b for tumor and leukocyte, with the same linear model, we solved for b (deconvoluted value) extracting
the leukocyte fraction (LF).
Stromal fraction (SF) was defined as the total non-tumor cellular component, obtained by subtracting tumor purity from unity.
Tumor purity was generated using ABSOLUTE (Carter et al., 2012) as detailed in Taylor et al., 2018.
TumorMap
We used the latent iCluster space (Table S7) to calculate Euclidean similarity between every pair of samples, where Euclidean
similarity = (1 / (1 + Euclidean_distance)) (https://tumormap.ucsc.edu/). The distances were used as input to generate a 2D layout
of the samples using the physics-based Distributed Recursive (Graph) Layout method (Alencar and Polley, 2011), previously known
as VxOrd (Davidson et al., 2001). DrL layout engine was used with each sample’s 28 most similar neighbors. DrL’s default settings
were used for ‘‘edge cutting’’ and ‘‘intermediate output interval’’ parameters, 0.8 and 0, respectively. Sample lists for attributes
(GI, gyn, kidney, stemness, squamous) were obtained from other working groups.
PARADIGM
The PARADIGM algorithm with the interaction-learning update (Chu et al., 2014; Vaske et al., 2010) was used to infer protein
activities in the context of gene regulatory pathways, based on gene expression and copy-number data. The method uses a
Cell 173, 291–304.e1–e6, April 5, 2018
e5
 set of interactions from several sources (NCI-PID, Reactome, and KEGG) and superimposes them into a single network
(SuperPathway). The SuperPathway contained 7,369 proteins, 9,354 multi-protein complexes, 2,092 families, and 592 cellular
processes connected by 45,315 interactions. The PARADIGM algorithm was applied to 9,829 tumors with platform-
corrected expression data and gene-level copy-number alteration data from 33 cancer types to infer the integrated pathway levels
(IPLs) of the 19,504 SuperPathway features.
Pathway features characterizing each iCluster were identified by comparing each iCluster versus all others using the t test and
Wilcoxon Rank sum test with Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) false discovery rate (FDR) correction. An initial minimum variation filter
(at least 1 sample with absolute activity > 0.05) was applied; and the 15,502 features passing the minimum variation feature were
considered in this analysis. Features deemed significant (FDR corrected p < 0.05) by both tests and showing an absolute difference
in group means > 0.05 were selected. The selected pathway features were assessed for interconnectivity; regulatory nodes with
differential inferred IPLs that also had at least 15 differential downstream regulatory targets were identified.
Gene Programs/Canonical pathways
Twenty-two Gene Programs and 20 additional pathways were used to characterize the molecular, signaling, and pathway level
characteristics of the iCluster-based subtypes. The Gene Programs were identified in a previous PanCancer analysis of 12 tumor
types, by 1) assembling 6,898 gene signatures documented to contain gene sets that are coexpressed, coamplified, or function
together; 2) applying a bimodality filter to select only those signatures with bimodal (ON/OFF) expression; and 3) performing weighted
gene correlation network-based clustering (WGCNA) to identify a non-redundant set of expression modules/programs (see Hoadley
et al. [2014] and associated SI, Section 5, for details). These Gene Programs were evaluated in the PanCancer-33 dataset by
averaging the top most-correlated signatures from each module (Table S9). The 20 additional pathways represent known drug
targets or/and canonical cancer pathways (Table S4 of Hoadley et al. [2014]) and were evaluated as the mean expression level of
pathway genes.
