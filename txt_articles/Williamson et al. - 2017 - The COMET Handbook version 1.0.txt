Abstract
The selection of appropriate outcomes is crucial when designing clinical trials in order to compare the effects of
different interventions directly. For the findings to influence policy and practice, the outcomes need to be relevant
and important to key stakeholders including patients and the public, health care professionals and others making
decisions about health care. It is now widely acknowledged that insufficient attention has been paid to the choice
of outcomes measured in clinical trials. Researchers are increasingly addressing this issue through the development
and use of a core outcome set, an agreed standardised collection of outcomes which should be measured and
reported, as a minimum, in all trials for a specific clinical area.
Accumulating work in this area has identified the need for guidance on the development, implementation,
evaluation and updating of core outcome sets. This Handbook, developed by the COMET Initiative, brings together
current thinking and methodological research regarding those issues. We recommend a four-step process to
develop a core outcome set. The aim is to update the contents of the Handbook as further research is identified.

Chapter 1: Background
1.1 Outcomes in clinical trials
Clinical trials are research studies undertaken with human
beings for the purpose of assessing the safety and effect-
iveness of interventions, treatments or care procedures.
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are seen as the ‘gold
standard’ in evaluating the effects of treatments [1].
There are three basic components of randomised clinical
trials [2]:
1. At least one test treatment and a comparator
treatment
2. Randomisation of treatment allocation
3. Outcome measure(s)
It is the third component that is the focus of this Hand-
book. Broadly, in the context of clinical trials, an outcome
is defined to be a measurement or observation used to
capture and assess the effect of treatment such as
assessment of side effects (risk) or effectiveness (benefits).
When designing a clinical trial, the ‘PICO’ format is often
used to formulate a research question. A ‘well-built’ ques-
tion should include four parts; that is identifying the pa-
tient problem or population (P), the intervention (I), the
comparator (C) and the outcomes of interest (O) [3]. In a
randomised trial, differences between the groups in out-
comes can be inferred to be as a result of the differing in-
terventions. Therefore, the selection, measurement and
reporting of important, relevant and appropriate out-
comes are critical.
Researchers, clinicians and policy-makers often dis-
tinguish between the efficacy and the effectiveness of
an intervention. Whereas efficacy trials (also described
as explanatory trials) determine whether an interven-
tion can have a beneficial effect in an ideal situation
under
optimum
conditions
[4],
effectiveness
trials
(also described as pragmatic trials) measure the de-
gree of beneficial effect under ‘real-world’ clinical set-
tings. In contrast to an efficacy trial, an effectiveness
trial will usually be conducted following as close to
clinical practice as possible [5]. Design of effectiveness
trials are, therefore, based on conditions of, and with
consideration to, routine clinical practice and clinical

 decision-making. Efficacy trials tend to precede effect-
iveness trials, and although it is preferential to distin-
guish
between
efficacy
and
effectiveness
trials,
in
reality they exist on a continuum [1], often making it
difficult to separate the two as distinct phases of re-
search. The focus of this Handbook will be effective-
ness trials.
Clinical trials will usually include multiple outcomes of
interest, and the main outcomes are usually those essential
for decision-making. Some outcomes will be of more
interest than others. The primary outcome is typically
chosen to be the one of greatest therapeutic importance

to
relevant
stakeholders,

as

and
clinicians, is an integral component of the research ques-
tion under investigation and is usually the one used in the

[7].
Sometimes,
researchers
propose more than one primary outcome if they are
thought to be of equal therapeutic importance and rele-
vance to the research question. This can also be useful if it
is unclear which single primary outcome will best answer
the question. Secondary outcomes evaluate other benefi-
cial or harmful effects of secondary importance or are use-
ful for explaining additional effects of the intervention [8].
Secondary outcomes may also be exploratory in nature.
Harmful effects should always be viewed as important re-
gardless of their primary or secondary outcome label [7].
In addition to assessing relative therapeutic benefit and
safety, decision-makers are usually also interested in the
acceptability and cost-effectiveness of the interventions
under study.
A variety of different types of outcomes can be mea-
sured in trials, and researchers must decide which of
these to measure. As well as the importance of an out-
come to relevant stakeholders, researchers must con-
sider an array of information, including how responsive
it is to the interventions being compared and the appro-
priateness to the trial; for example, the financial cost and
acceptability to patients associated with measuring that
outcome. The decision is made more complex by the
numerous types of outcomes that exist, and researchers
must decide which of these types of outcomes is most
appropriate for both the question under investigation
and the specific context of the clinical trial. For example,
a clinical outcome describes a medical event(s) that oc-
curs as a result of disease or treatment [9], and relates to
a patient’s symptoms, overall mental state or how the
patient functions. In contrast, a surrogate endpoint is
used as a substitute for a clinical outcome [10]. A bio-
marker is another type of outcome and is a medical sign,
typically used in earlier phase trials, used to predict bio-
logical processes. Examples of biomarkers include every-
thing from pulse and blood pressure through basic
chemistries to more complex laboratory tests of blood
and other tissues [11].
In addition to deciding what to measure, Zarin et al.
describe that a fully specified outcome measure includes
information about the following [12]: domain (e.g. anx-
iety), that is what to measure; specific measurement (e.g.
Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale), that is how to measure
that outcome/domain; the specific metric used to char-
acterise each participant’s results (e.g. change from base-
line at specified time); and method of aggregation (e.g. a
categorical measure such as proportion of participants
with a decrease greater than 50%).
Furthermore, outcomes can also be measured in differ-
ent ways. Some clinical outcomes are composed of a
combination of items, and are referred to as composite
outcomes. Outcomes can be objective, that is not subject
to a large degree of individual interpretation, and these
are likely to be reliably measured across patients in a
study, by different health care providers, and over time.
Laboratory tests may be considered objective measures
in most cases. Outcomes may also be considered to be
subjective. Most clinical outcomes involve varying de-
grees of subjectivity; for example, a diagnosis or assess-
ment by a health care provider, carer or the patient
themselves. A clinician-reported outcome is an assess-
ment that is determined by an observer with some
recognised professional training that is relevant to the
measurement being made. In contrast, an observer-
reported outcome is an assessment that is determined
by an observer who does not have a background of pro-
fessional training that is relevant to the measurement
being made, i.e. a non-clinician observer such as a
teacher or caregiver. This type of assessment is often
used when the patient is unable to self-report (e.g. in-
fants, young children). Finally, a patient-reported out-
come is a measurement based on a report that comes
directly from the patient (i.e. the study participant)
about the status of particular aspects of or events related
to a patient’s health condition [9].
1.2 Problems with outcomes
Clinical trials seek to evaluate whether an intervention is
effective and safe by comparing the effects of interven-
tions on outcomes, and by measuring differences in out-
comes between groups. Clinical decisions about the care
of individual patients are made on the basis of these out-
comes, so clearly the selection of outcomes to be mea-
sured and reported in trials is critical. The chosen
outcomes need to be relevant to health service users and
others involved in making decisions and choices about
health care. However, a lack of adequate attention to the
choice of outcomes in clinical trials has led to avoidable
waste in both the production and reporting of research,
and the outcomes included in research have not always
been those that patients regard as most important or
relevant [13].

 Inconsistencies in outcomes have caused problems for
people trying to use health care research, illustrated by the
following two examples [14]: (1) a review of oncology tri-
als found that more than 25,000 outcomes appeared only
once or twice [15] and (2) in 102/143 (71%) Cochrane re-
views, the authors were unable to obtain the findings for
key outcomes in the included trials, with 26 (18%) missing
data for the review’s prespecified primary outcome from
over half of the patients included in the research [16]. In
addition, variability in how outcomes are defined and
measured can make it difficult, or impossible, to synthe-
sise and apply the results of different research studies. For
example, a survey of 10,000 controlled trials involving
people with schizophrenia found that 2194 different meas-
urement scales had been used [17].
Alongside this inconsistency in the measurement of
outcomes, outcome-reporting bias adds further to the
problems faced by users of research who wish to make
well-informed decisions about health care. Outcome-
reporting bias has been defined as the selection of a subset
of the original recorded outcomes, on the basis of the re-
sults, for inclusion in the published reports of trials and
other research [18]. Empirical evidence shows that out-
comes that are statistically significant are more likely to be
fully reported [19]. Selective reporting of outcomes means
that fully informed decisions cannot be made about the
care of patients, resource allocation, research priorities
and study design. This can lead to the use of ineffective or
even harmful interventions, and to the waste of health
care resources that are already limited [20].
1.3 Standardising outcomes
1.3.1 Core outcome sets (COS)
These issues of inconsistency and outcome-reporting
bias could be reduced with the development and appli-
cation of agreed standardised sets of outcomes, known
as core outcome sets (COS), that should be measured
and reported in all trials for a specific clinical area [21].
As previously noted [22], these sets represent ‘the mini-
mum that should be measured and reported in all clinical
trials of a specific condition and could also be suitable for
use in other types of research and clinical audit’ [23]. It is
to be expected that the core outcomes will always be col-
lected and reported, and that researchers will likely also
include other outcomes of particular relevance or interest
to their specific study. Measuring a COS does not mean
that outcomes in a particular trial necessarily need to be
restricted to just those in the set.
The first step in the development of a COS is typically
to identify what to measure [22]. Once agreement has
been reached regarding what should be measured, how
the outcomes included in the core set should be defined
and measured is then determined.
The use of COS will lead to higher-quality trials, and
make it easier for the results of trials to be compared,
contrasted and combined as appropriate, thereby redu-
cing waste in research [22]. This approach would reduce
heterogeneity between trials because all trials would
measure and report the agreed important outcomes, lead
to research that is more likely to have measured relevant
outcomes due to the involvement of relevant stake-
holders in the process of determining what is core, and
be of potential value to use in clinical audit. Importantly,
it would enhance the value of evidence synthesis by re-
ducing the risk of outcome-reporting bias and ensuring
that all trials contribute usable information.
1.3.2 Core outcome set initiatives
One of the earliest examples of an attempt to standardise
outcomes is an initiative by the World Health Organisa-
tion in the 1970s, relating to cancer trials [24]. More than
30 representatives from groups doing trials in cancer came
together, the result of which was a WHO Handbook of
guidelines recommending the minimum requirements for
data collection in cancer trials. The most notable work to
date relating to outcome standardisation since has been
conducted by the OMERACT (Outcome Measures in
Rheumatology) collaboration [25] which advocates the use
of COS, designed using consensus techniques, in clinical
trials in rheumatology. This, and other relevant initiatives,
is described below.
OMERACT is an independent initiative of international
health professionals interested in outcome measures in
rheumatology.
The
first
OMERACT conference
on
rheumatoid arthritis was held in Maastricht, in the
Netherlands in 1992 [26]. The motivation for this was dis-
cussions between two of the executive members, compar-
ing the outcomes for patients with rheumatoid arthritis in
European clinical trials with that of North American clin-
ical trials, and noting that they used different endpoints.
This made it extremely difficult to compare and combine
in meta-analyses. Over the last 20 years, OMERACT has
served a critical role in the development and validation of
clinical and radiographic outcome measures in rheuma-
toid arthritis, osteoarthritis, psoriatic arthritis, fibromyal-
gia, and other rheumatic diseases. OMERACT strives to
improve outcome measurement in rheumatology through
a ‘data driven’
, iterative consensus process involving rele-
vant stakeholder groups [27].
An important aspect of OMERACT now is the integra-
tion of patients at each stage of the OMERACT process,
but this was not always the case. Initially, OMERACT did
not include patients in the process of developing COS.
The patient perspective workshop at OMERACT 6 in
2002 addressed the question of looking at outcomes from
the patient perspective. Fatigue emerged as a major out-
come in rheumatoid arthritis, and it was agreed that this
The Author(s) Trials 2017, 18(Suppl 3):280
Page 3 of 50
 should be considered for inclusion in the core set [28–30].
This patient input along with clinical trialist insight,
epidemiologist assessment and industry perspective,
has led OMERACT to be a prominent decision-making
group in developing outcome measures for all types of
clinical trials and observational research in rheumatol-
ogy. OMERACT has now developed COS for many
rheumatological conditions, and has described a con-
ceptual framework for developing core sets in rheuma-
tology (described in ‘Section 0’) [31].
Since OMERACT there have been other examples of
similar COS initiatives to develop recommendations about
the outcomes that should be measured in clinical trials.
One example is the Initiative on Methods, Measurement,
and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials (IMMPACT) [32],
whose aim is to develop consensus reviews and recom-
mendations for improving the design, execution and inter-
pretation of clinical trials of treatments for pain. The first
IMMPACT meeting was held in November 2002, and
there have been a total of 17 consensus meetings on clin-
ical trials of treatments for acute and chronic pain in
adults and children. Another exemplar is the Harmonising
Outcome Measures for Eczema (HOME) Initiative [33].
This is an international group working to develop core
outcomes to include in all eczema trials.
1.3.3 The COMET Initiative
The COMET (Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness
Trials) Initiative brings together people interested in the
development and application of COS [34]. COMET aims
to collate and stimulate relevant resources, both applied
and methodological, to facilitate exchange of ideas and
information, and to foster methodological research in
this area. As previously described [35], specific objectives
are to:
1. Raise awareness of current problems with outcomes
in clinical trials
2. Encourage COS development and uptake
3. Promote Patient and Public Involvement (PPI) in
COS development
4. Provide resources to facilitate these aims
5. Avoid unnecessary duplication of effort
6. Encourage evidence-based COS development
The COMET Initiative was launched at a meeting in
Liverpool in January 2010, funded by the MRC North
West Hub for Trials Methodology (NWHTMR). More
than 110 people attended, with representatives from trial-
ists, systematic reviewers, health service users, clinical
teams, journal editors, trial funders, policy-makers, trials
registries and regulators. The feedback was uniformly sup-
portive, indicating a strong consensus that the time was
right for such an initiative. The meeting was followed by a
second meeting in Bristol in July 2011 which reinforced
the need for COS across a wide range of areas of health
and the role of COMET in helping to coordinate informa-
tion about these. COMET has gone on to have subsequent
successful international meetings in Manchester (2013),
Rome (2014) [36] and Calgary (2015) [37] to affirm this.
For COS to be an effective solution, they need to be eas-
ily accessible by researchers and other key groups. Previ-
ously, it has been difficult to identify COS because they
are hard to find in the academic literature. This might
mean that they have not been used in new studies or that
there has been unnecessary duplication of effort in devel-
oping new COS. The COMET Initiative sought to tackle
this problem by undertaking a systematic review of COS
(see section ‘Populating the COMET database’), and to re-
duce the possibility of waste in research by bringing these
resources together in one place. The COMET website and
database were launched in August 2011. The COMET Ini-
tiative database is a repository of studies relevant to the
development of COS. In addition to the searchable data-
base, the website provides:
� Information about COMET, including aims and
objectives and a description of the COMET
Management Group
� Information about upcoming and past COMET
events, including workshops and meetings organised
by the COMET Initiative
� Resources for COS developers, including relevant
publications, examples of grant-funded projects, ex-
amples of COS development protocols, plain lan-
guage summaries and PPI resources
� Relevant web links, including core outcome
networks and collaborations, patient involvement,
how to measure, and research funding
The growing awareness of the need for COS is reflected
in the website and database usage figures [22, 38]. Use of
the website continues to increase, with more than 20,900
visits in 2015 (25% increase over 2014), 15,366 unique vis-
itors (25% increase), 13,049 new visitors (33% increase)
and a rise in the proportion of visits from outside the UK
(11,090 visits; 53% of all visits). By December 2015, a total
of 9999 searches had been completed, with 3411 in 2014
alone (43% increase).
1.3.3.1 Populating the COMET database A systematic
review of COS was conducted in August 2013 [14], and
subsequently updated to include all published COS up
to, and inclusive of, December 2014 [39]. The aim of the
systematic reviews was to identify studies which had the
aim of determining which outcomes or domains to
measure in all clinical trials in a specific condition, and
to identify and describe the methodological techniques
The Author(s) Trials 2017, 18(Suppl 3):280
Page 4 of 50
 used in these studies. The two reviews have identified a
total of 227 published COS up to, and including, De-
cember 2014. The systematic reviews highlighted great
variability in the ways that COS had been developed,
particularly the methods used and the stakeholders in-
cluded as participants in the process. The update dem-
onstrated that recent studies appear to have adopted a
more structured approach towards COS development
and public representation has increased. We will be re-
ferring to the results of these reviews in more detail
throughout the Handbook.
As noted above, the types of studies included in the data-
base are those in which COS have been developed, as well
as studies relevant to COS development, including system-
atic reviews of outcomes and patients’ views. Individuals
and groups who are planning or developing a COS, who
have completed one or who have identified one in an ad
hoc way can submit it for inclusion. There are now over
120 ongoing COS included in the COMET database
(correct as of April 2016). Furthermore, we maintain a sep-
arate list of studies (not included in the database), to in-
clude information on studies that have not yet progressed
beyond an expression of interest or a very early stage in
their development. It also contains some studies where per-
mission is needed before they can be included in the main,
online database. This list currently includes approximately
90 studies (correct as of February 2016).
1.3.4 Other relevant initiatives
Whilst the initiatives described above are specific to the
development of COS for trials in particular areas of
health, there are a few other recent initiatives relevant to
the improvement of outcome measurement. One such
initiative is the Core Outcomes in Women’s Health
(CROWN) initiative. This is an international group, led
by journal editors, to harmonise outcome reporting in
women’s health research [40]. This consortium aims to
promote COS in the specialty, encourage researchers to
develop COS and facilitate reporting of the development
of COS.
The US National Institutes of Health (NIH) encourages
the use of common data elements (CDEs) in NIH-
supported research projects or registries. The NIH provide
a resource portal that includes databases and repositories
of data elements and Case Report Forms that may assist
investigators in identifying and selecting data elements for
use in their projects [41]. PROMIS is another NIH initia-
tive and is part of the NIH goal to develop systems to sup-
port NIH-funded research supported by all of its institutes
and centres [41]. PROMIS provides a system of measures
of patient-reported health status for physical, mental
health and social health which can be used across chronic
conditions (see description in ‘Ontologies for grouping in-
dividual outcomes into outcome domains’ in Chapter 2).
Once it has been decided what outcomes should be mea-
sured, PROMIS is a source of information regarding how
those outcomes could be measured.
Once a COS has been agreed, it is then important to de-
termine how the outcomes included in the set should be
defined and measured. Several measurement instruments
may exist to measure a given outcome, usually with vary-
ing psychometric properties (e.g. reliability and validity).
Important sources of information for selecting a measure-
ment instrument for a COS are systematic reviews of
measurement instruments. The COnsensus-based Stan-
dards for the selection of health Measurement INstru-
ments (COSMIN) initiative collates systematic reviews of
measurement properties of available measurement instru-
ments that intend to measure (aspects of) health status or
(health-related) quality of life. An overview of these re-
views and guidelines for performing such reviews can be
found on the COSMIN website [42]. COSMIN has also
developed a checklist about which measurement proper-
ties are important and standards for how to evaluate their
measurement properties [43]. The COSMIN checklist will
facilitate the selection of the most appropriate PRO meas-
ure amongst competing instruments. A collaboration be-
tween COSMIN and COMET has recently resulted in the
development of a guideline on how to select outcome
measurement instruments for outcomes included in a
COS [44]. COSMIN has recently started a new project
with the aim of developing a separate version of the COS-
MIN checklist for non-PRO measurements.
The Clinical Outcome Assessments (COA) staff at the
US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), previously
known as the Study Endpoints and Labelling Develop-
ment (SEALD) Study Endpoints Team, aim to encourage
the development and application of patient-focussed
endpoint measures in medical product development to
describe clinical benefit in labelling. The COA staff en-
gage with stakeholders to improve clinical outcome
measurement standards and policy development, by pro-
viding guidance on COA development, validation and
interpretation of clinical benefit endpoints in clinical tri-
als. The FDA define a COA as a ‘measure of patient’s
symptoms, overall mental state, or the effects of a dis-
ease or condition on how the patient functions’. Put sim-
ply, the COA staff work to ensure that the evidence
provided about an outcome instrument can be relied
upon in the context of drug development and regulatory
decision-making.
The Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium
(CDISC) is a global Standards Development Organisa-
tion (SDO) ‘to develop and support global, platform-
independent data standards that enable information
system interoperability to improve medical research
and related areas of health care’ [45]. CDISC aims to
establish worldwide industry standards to support the

and
biopharmaceutical product development and research
processes. The Coalition for Accelerating Standards
and Therapies (CFAST) Initiative is a CDISC partner-
ship, set up to accelerate clinical research and medical
product development by creating and maintaining data
standards, tools and methods for conducting research
in therapeutic areas that are important to public health
[45]. One of its objectives is to identify common stan-
dards for representing clinical data for drug studies in
priority therapeutic areas. This includes standardising
definitions of outcomes, and the way in which out-
comes are described.
1.4 The aim of this Handbook
As stated above, one of the aims of the COMET Initia-
tive is to encourage evidence-based COS development.
Although some guidance exists for COS developers
[21, 46, 47], it is varied in the level of detail and is often
unclear regarding the level of evidence available to sup-
port particular methodological recommendations.
The aim of the Handbook is to describe current know-
ledge in the area of COS development, implementation,
review and uptake, and to make recommendations for
practice and research as appropriate. The Handbook will
be updated as further research is undertaken and re-
ported, in order to continue to inform good methodo-
logical practice in this area.
Figure 1 illustrates the approach taken to COS develop-
ment in this Handbook. Steps 1–4 are covered in detail in
Chapter 2, and describe a process for determining what to
measure, the COS. Step 5, determining how to measure
the outcomes in the COS, is covered briefly since much
has been written and described elsewhere. Step 5 is crucial
to achieve future uptake and thereby realise the benefits of
COS development. Chapter 3 covers implementation, re-
view and feedback. Chapter 4 provides recommendations
for practice, proposes a methodological research agenda,
and discusses other areas where the use of COS may be
beneficial.
Chapter 2: Developing a core outcome set
2.1 Background
The development of a COS in health care involves work-
ing with key stakeholders to prioritise large numbers of
outcomes and achieve consensus as to the core set. Vari-
ous methods have been used to develop a COS and it is
uncertain which are most suitable, accurate and efficient.
Research to identify optimal methods of developing COS
is ongoing and there is currently wide variation in the ap-
proaches used [14]. Methods include the Delphi technique
[48, 49], nominal group technique [50, 51], consensus
development conference [52] and semistructured group
discussion [53]. Many studies have used a combination of
methods to reach consensus’ for example, Ruperto et al.
[54] used the Delphi approach followed by the nominal
group technique at a face-to-face meeting, whilst Harman
et al. [55], Potter et al. [56], van’t Hooft et al. [57] and
Blazeby et al. [58] used the Delphi approach followed by
face-to-face semistructured discussion.
One example where consensus work has been under-
taken in two different ways is in paediatric asthma. The
American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Soci-
ety employed an expert panel approach [59], whereas
other researchers combined results from a Delphi survey
with clinicians and interviews with parents and children
[60]. The results were overlapping but not identical. Fe-
male sexual dysfunction is another disease area where
different methods have been used to obtain consensus.
In one study, a literature review was undertaken and
critiqued by experts [61], whereas in another study, a
modified Delphi method was used to develop consensus
definitions and classifications [62]. Both studies resulted
in the same primary outcome; however, secondary out-
comes differed. Similarly, multiple COS have also been
developed for systemic lupus erythematosus. OMER-
ACT adopted a nominal group process to rank outcome
domains [63], whereas EULAR adopted a consensus
building approach [64]. The results from both studies
were very similar, with EULAR recommending other
additional outcomes.

 COS developers have identified that methodological
guidance for COS development would be helpful [65].
There is limited empirical evidence, however, regarding
whether different methods lead to similar or different
conclusions, and there is a need to develop evidence-
based approaches to COS development.
The OMERACT Handbook is a useful resource for
those wishing to develop COS in the area of rheumatol-
ogy under the umbrella of the OMERACT organisation
[46]. We have previously identified issues to be considered
in the development of COS more generally [21] and ex-
pand on those here, together with additional ones identi-
fied since this earlier publication. We present information
about how COS developers have tackled these issues using
data from our previous systematic reviews [14, 39] and de-
scribe results from methodological research studies where
available.
In the systematic review (227 COS identified), 63% of
studies made recommendations about what to measure
only. Some of the remaining studies also made recom-
mendations about how to measure the outcomes that
they included in their core set, with 35% of studies doing
this as a single process, considering both what to meas-
ure and how to measure. The remaining 2% of studies in
the systematic review of COS considered what to meas-
ure and how to measure outcomes included in the core
set as a two-stage process, first considering what to
measure and then considering how to measure. Thus,
there appears to be consistency in that the first step in
the process is typically to gain agreement about ‘what’ to
measure, with decisions about ‘how’ and ‘when’ to meas-
ure these outcomes usually later in the process. This
two-stage process has the advantage of being able to
identify gaps where further research would be needed,
e.g. if an outcome is deemed to be of core importance
but no outcome measurement instrument exists with
adequate psychometric properties.
This chapter provides guidance on developing consen-
sus about what to measure, i.e. a COS, and provides rec-
ommendations for finding and selecting instruments for
measuring the outcomes in the core set, i.e. the how.
2.2 Scope of a core outcome set
The scope of a COS refers to the specific area of health or
health care of interest to which the COS is to be applied.
The scope should be described in terms of the health con-
dition, target population and interventions that the COS
is to be applicable to, thus covering the first three ele-
ments of the PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparator,
Outcomes) structure for a clinical trial.
This can be one of the most difficult aspects of the
process, but clarity from the outset will likely reduce
later problems of misinterpretation and ambiguity. This
will help to focus the development of the COS and help
potential users decide on its relevance to their work.
2.2.1 Health condition and target population
For example, in prostate cancer, a COS may be devel-
oped for all patients or it may focus on patients with
localised disease.
2.2.2 Interventions
For example, a COS may be created for use in all trials
of interventions to treat localised prostate cancer or just
for surgery.
Of the 227 COS published up to the end of 2014, 53%
did not specify whether the COS was intended for all in-
terventions or a particular intervention type, 7% were
for any intervention, and 40% were for a specific inter-
vention type.
2.2.3 Setting
The focus of this Handbook is on the development of
COS for effectiveness trials. A distinction is made between
efficacy and effectiveness trials, since developing a COS to
cover both designs may lead to difficulties with respect to
particular domains such as health care resource use [48].
COS are equally applicable in other settings; for example,
routine clinical practice (see ‘Chapter 4’).
2.3 Establishing the need for a core outcome set
2.3.1 Does a relevant core outcome set already exist?
The first thing to do is find out whether a relevant COS
exists by reviewing the academic literature.
One of the difficulties in this area of research has been to
identify whether studies have already been done, or are un-
derway, to develop a COS. The COMET Initiative has de-
veloped an online searchable database, enabling researchers
to check for existing or ongoing work before embarking on
a new project, thus minimising unnecessary duplication of
effort. A video of ‘How to search the COMET database’ can
be found on the COMET website [66].
The COMET database is populated through an annual
systematic review update of published studies, and by
COS developers registering their new projects. To avoid
missing any ongoing projects not yet registered in the
COMET database, it is recommended that researchers
contact other experts in the particular health condition,
as well as the COMET project coordinator, to check
whether any related work is ongoing. It may also be pru-
dent to apply the COMET search strategy [14] with add-
itional filter terms for the area of interest for the recent
period since the last COMET annual update.
Although there may be no exact match for the scope
of interest, it may be that a related COS exists, e.g. a
COS for all interventions in the condition of interest has
been developed but a COS for a specific intervention
The Author(s) Trials 2017, 18(Suppl 3):280
Page 7 of 50
 type is sought, or a COS was developed by relevant
stakeholders in countries other than that of the team
with the current interest, or a COS was developed
with the same scope but did not involve obtaining pa-
tients’ views.
2.3.2 Is a core outcome set needed?
If a relevant COS does not exist, a review of previous tri-
als [67] or systematic reviews [68] in the area can pro-
vide evidence of need for a COS. Systematic reviewers
are starting to use the outcome matrix recommended by
the ORBIT project [69] to display the outcomes reported
in the eligible studies. This matrix may demonstrate in-
consistency of outcomes measured to date in addition to
potential outcome-reporting bias.
The rest of this chapter is written from the premise
that the development of a new COS is warranted. If a
COS already exists, but the quality could be improved
by additional work related to particular stakeholder
groups, countries, or alternative consensus methods,
then certain sections below will also be of relevance.
The issue of quality assessment is discussed in ‘Quality
assessment/critical appraisal’ below and in ‘Chapter 4’.
2.3.3 Avoiding unnecessary duplication of effort
The COMET database is a useful resource for researchers
to see what work has been done in their area of interest
and for research funders wishing to avoid unnecessary du-
plication of effort when supporting new COS activities, as
illustrated by the following two examples.
Example 1 In September 2014 Valerie Page (Watford
General Hospital, UK) contacted COMET via the web-
site to register the development of a COS in delirium.
We followed up the request for additional information
so that we could register this in the database, and in the
meantime we logged this on the private non-database
list that we use to keep track of work that we know
about prior to inclusion in the database. Whilst waiting
for this information to be returned, in May 2015 we re-
ceived a second request for registration of COS develop-
ment in the same clinical area by Louise Rose from the
University of Toronto, Canada. The researchers were
unaware of each other’s work. We got in touch with
both researchers and asked for permission to share de-
tails of their work, as well as to pass on contact details.
In September 2015 we received confirmation that Louise
Rose and Valerie Page, with the European Delirium As-
sociation and American Delirium Society, are now work-
ing collaboratively on this. Details of this collaborative
effort to develop a COS for delirium can be found in the
database [70].
Example 2 Benjamin Allin (University of Oxford, UK)
started planning a study to develop a COS for infants
with
gastroschisis
in
early
2015.
He
checked
the
COMET database to see if a COS existed, but nothing
was registered at that time. He contacted COMET in
September 2015 to register his project. On receiving this
request, the COMET project coordinator checked the
COMET database to find out if there was any relevant
work in this area and identified an ongoing study regis-
tered in this same area of gastroschisis. This latter work
had been registered by Nigel Hall (University of South-
ampton and Southampton Children’s Hospital, UK) in
June 2015. Again, the two groups were put in touch, and
they met up to discuss the proposed core sets, which re-
sulted in a plan being drawn up for collaboration to work
together to produce one COS rather than two. The exist-
ing gastroschisis COS entry in the database has been up-
dated to reflect this collaborative effort [71].
2.4 Study protocol
There are potential sources of bias in the COS develop-
ment process, and preparing a protocol in advance may
help to reduce these biases, improve transparency and
share methods with others. We recommend that a protocol
be developed prior to the start of the study, and made pub-
lically available, either through a link on the COMET regis-
tration entry or a journal publication [72–74]. In a similar
way to the development of the SPIRIT guidance for clinical
trial protocols, there is a need to agree protocol content.
2.5 Project registration
One of the aims of the COMET Initiative is to provide a
means of identifying existing, ongoing and planned COS
studies. COS developers should be encouraged to register
their project in a free-to-access, unrestricted public reposi-
tory, such as the COMET database, which is the only such
repository we are aware of.
The following information about the scope and methods
used is recorded in the database for existing and ongoing
work:
1. Clinical areas for which the outcomes are being
considered, identifying both primary disease and
types of intervention
2. Target population (age and sex), and any other
details about the population within the health area
3. Setting for intended use (e.g. research and/or
practice)
4. Method of development to be used for the COS
5. People and organisations involved in identifying and
selecting the outcomes, recording how the relative
contributions will be used to define the COS
The Author(s) Trials 2017, 18(Suppl 3):280

 Details of any associated publications, including the
protocol and the final report, can be recorded in the
COMET database, added to the original COMET regis-
tration page.
2.6 Stakeholder involvement
It is important to consider which groups of people should
be involved in deciding which outcomes are core to meas-
ure, and why. Bringing diverse stakeholders together to try
to reach a consensus is seen to be the future of collabora-
tive, influential research.
Key stakeholders may include health service users,
health care practitioners, trialists, regulators, industry rep-
resentatives, policy-makers, researchers and the public.
Decisions regarding the stakeholder groups to be involved,
how they are to be identified and approached, and the
number from each group will be dependent upon the par-
ticular scope of the COS as well as upon existing know-
ledge, the methods of COS development to be used, and
practical feasibility considerations. For example, a COS for
an intervention that aims to improve body image, e.g.
breast reconstruction following mastectomy, is likely to
have predominantly patients as the key stakeholders [56].
The stages of involvement during the process should
also be considered for each stakeholder group. For ex-
ample, it may be considered appropriate to involve meth-
odologists in determining how to measure particular
outcomes, but not to be involved in determining what to
measure. These decisions should be documented and ex-
plained in the study protocol.
Consideration should be given to the representative-
ness of the sample of stakeholders and the ability of
people across the different groups to engage with the
chosen consensus method (including online activities
and face-to-face meetings).
Consideration should be given to potential conflicts of
interest within the group developing the COS (for ex-
ample, the developers of measurement instruments in
the area of interest or those whose work is focussed on a
specific outcome).
2.6.1 Patient and public involvement and participation
COMET recognises the expertise and crucial contribu-
tion of patients and carers in developing COS. COS need
to include outcomes that are most relevant to patients
and carers, and the best way to do this is to include
them in COS development. Examples exist where pa-
tients have identified an outcome important to them as
a group that might not have been considered if the COS
had been developed by practitioners on their own [75,
76]. However, it is worth noting that examples also exist
where health professionals have identified areas that pa-
tients were reluctant to talk about in focus groups; for
example, sexual health [77].
2.6.1.1 Patient and public participation We refer to
patients taking part in the COS study as ‘research partic-
ipants’ and the activity as research ‘participation’. People
involved in a COS study as research participants give
their views on the importance of outcomes and may also
subsequently be asked their opinion on how those out-
comes are to be measured.
Of the 227 COS that had been published up to the
end of December 2014, 44 (19%) studies reported in-
cluding patient participants in the COS development
process. However, of these 44 COS, only 26 (59%) stud-
ies provided details of how patients had participated in
the development process. The most commonly used
methods to include patient participants were the Delphi
technique and semistructured group discussion which
were used in 38% and 35% of studies, respectively. Three
of the 26 (12%) COS studies were developed with only
patients as participants. Of the remaining 23 studies, pa-
tients participated alongside clinicians during the devel-
opment process in 19 (83%) studies, as compared to two
(9%) studies where patients and clinicians participated
separately throughout the whole development process.
In the two remaining studies, patients and clinicians par-
ticipated separately in the initial stages, but then along-
side side each other during the final stages of the
development process. For the 21 studies where patients
and clinicians did participate alongside each other for all
or part of the COS development process, the percentage
of patient participants included ranged from 4 to 50%.
Of ongoing COS studies (n = 127 as of 12 April 2016),
88% now include patients as participants. The question
now is not whether patients should participate, but ra-
ther the nature of that participation. It is recommended
that both health professionals and patients be included
in the decision-making process concerning what to
measure, as the minimum, unless there is good reason
to do otherwise. ‘Qualitative methods in core outcome
set development’ below discusses considerations to en-
hance patient participation in a COS.
2.6.1.2 Patient and public involvement When planning
a COS study that involves patients as research participants,
it is important to also involve patients in designing the study.
We refer to patients who are involved in designing and over-
seeing a COS study as ‘public research partners’ and this
activity as ‘patient involvement’. PPI has been defined as
where research is ‘being carried out “with” or “by” members
of the public rather than “to”, “about” or “for” them’ [78].
Involving public research partners in both the design
and oversight of the COS development study may have
the potential to:
� Provide advice on the best ways of identifying and
accessing particular patient populations
The Author(s) Trials 2017, 18(Suppl 3):280
Page 9 of 50
 � Inform discussions about ethical aspects of the study
� Facilitate the design of more appropriate study
information
� Promote the development of more relevant
materials to promote the study
� Enable ongoing troubleshooting opportunities for
patient participation issues during the study, e.g.
recruitment and retention issues of study
participants
� Inform the development of a dissemination strategy
of COS study results for patient participants and the
wider patient population
� Ensure that your COS is relevant to patients and,
crucially, that patients see it to be relevant and can
trust that the development process has genuinely
taken account of the patient perspective.
Involving public research partners in designing and
overseeing the COS study requires that researchers plan
for
this
involvement.
They
might
choose
different
methods of doing this; for example, they might have one
or two discussion groups in the planning stage and then
ongoing involvement of one or two public contributors
on the Study Advisory Group (SAG). For example,
Morris et al. (2015) engaged parents at various stages of
the research process and consulted with parents from
their ‘Family Faculty’ in designing a plain language sum-
mary of the results of their COS [79]. Numerous resources
now exist to help researchers to plan and budget for PPI
in research; for example: in the UK, INVOLVE have nu-
merous resources [80].
COMET has also produced a checklist for COS devel-
opers to consider with public research partners when
planning their COS study. These can be found on the
COMET website.
2.7 Determining ‘what’ to measure – the outcomes in a
core outcome set
2.7.1 Identifying existing knowledge about outcomes
It is recommended that potential relevant outcomes are
identified from existing work to inform the consensus
process. There are three data sources that should be con-
sidered: systematic reviews of published studies, reviews
of published qualitative work, investigation into items col-
lected in national audit data sets and interviews or focus
groups with key stakeholders to understand their views of
outcomes of importance. Depending on the resources
available, protocols within clinical trial registries may also
be a useful source of information.
2.7.1.1 Systematic review of outcomes in published
studies Systematic reviews are advantageous because
they can efficiently identify an inclusive list of outcomes
being
reported
by
researchers
in
a
given
area.
Nevertheless, it is important to note that systematic re-
views of outcomes just aggregate the opinions of the
previous researchers on what outcomes they deemed im-
portant to measure; hence the need for subsequent con-
sensus development to agree with the wider community
of stakeholders what outcomes should be included in a
COS.
The scope of the systematic review should be carefully
considered in the context of the COS to ensure that out-
comes are included from all relevant studies without
unnecessary data collection. The clinical area should be
clearly defined and appropriate databases accessed acc-
ordingly. Commonly used databases include Medline,
CINAHL, Embase, the Cochrane Database of Systematic
Reviews and PsycINFO. In the systematic reviews of COS
[14, 39], 57 (25%) studies carried out a review of outcomes
[65]. The number of databases searched was not reported
for 17 studies (30%), and two studies did not perform an
electronic database search. Thirty-eight studies described
which databases they searched (Table 1).
There is no recommended time window to conduct
systematic reviews. Some COS studies may examine all
the available academic literature. This may be an enor-
mous task in common disease areas. Scoping searches
are useful to determine the number of identified studies
for a specific area. Overly large reviews are resource in-
tensive and may not yield important additional outcomes.
One strategy is to perform the systematic review in stages
to check if outcome saturation is reached. For example, a
review of trials published over the last 5 years may be con-
ducted initially and the outcomes extracted. The search
may then extended, and the additional outcomes checked
against the original list. If there are no further outcomes
of importance then the systematic review may be consid-
ered complete. For most areas a recent search is recom-
mended as a minimum (e.g. the past 24 months) to
capture up-to-date developments and outcomes relevant
to that COS. Seventeen studies in the systematic reviews
of COS (30%) did not state the date range searched. Seven
studies (12%) did not apply any date restrictions to their
search. The number of years reported in the remaining 33
studies ranged between 2 and 59. Frequencies are pro-
vided in Table 2.
Data extraction should be considered in terms of:
1. Study characteristics
2. Outcomes
3. Outcome measurement instruments and/or
definitions provided by the authors for each
outcome
In terms of outcome extraction from the academic lit-
erature, it is recommended that all are extracted verba-
tim from the source manuscript [81]. This transparency
The Author(s) Trials 2017, 18(Suppl 3):280
Page 10 of 50
 is important to allow external critical review of the COS
right back to its inception. In addition, extraction of out-
come definitions supplied by, and measurement instru-
ments used by, the authors is recommended as this will
inform the selection of the outcome measurement set
which will occur at a later stage. This is necessary be-
cause outcome definitions may vary widely between in-
vestigators and it is often not clear as to what outcomes
are measuring [67, 82–84].
2.7.1.2 How to extract outcomes from the academic
literature to inform the questionnaire survey It is
likely that some outcomes will be the same but will have
been defined or measured in different publications in vari-
ous ways. For example, in a review of outcomes for colo-
rectal cancer surgery some 17 different definitions were
identified for ‘anastomotic leakage’ [85]. The first step is
to group these different definitions together (extracting
the wording description verbatim) under the same out-
come name. Similarly, in a review of outcomes for weight
loss surgery, it was apparent that different terminology is
used for weight loss itself in the academic literature [84].
The 41 different outcome assessments referring to weight
were all categorised into one item for a subsequent Delphi
questionnaire survey.
The next step is to group these outcomes into outcome
domains, constructs which can be used to classify broad
aspects of the effects of interventions, e.g. functional sta-
tus. Outcomes from multiple domains may be important
to measure in trials, and several outcomes within a do-
main may be relevant or important. Initially researchers
create outcome domains for each outcome to be grouped
into (see ‘Ontologies for grouping individual outcomes
into outcome domains’ below). The domains need discus-
sion and to be agreed by the team for the list to be cate-
gorised. Each outcome will then be mapped to a domain
(independently) and this will provide transparency. For ex-
ample, in a systematic review of studies evaluating the
management of otitis media with effusion in children with
cleft palate, a total of 43 outcomes were listed under 13
domain headings (see Table 18 in [81]).
Categorisation of each verbatim outcome definition to an
outcome name, and each outcome name to an outcome
domain is recommended to be performed independently by
two researchers from multiprofessional backgrounds. This

 may include expert health service researchers, clinicians
(e.g. surgeons, dietician, nurses, health psychologists) and
methodologists. Where two researchers work on this
process a senior researcher will need to resolve differences
and make final decisions.
2.7.1.3 Systematic review of studies to identify out-
comes of importance to health service users Similarly,
it is necessary to systematically review the academic litera-
ture to identify Patient-reported Outcome Measures
(PROMs) and then extract patient-reported outcome do-
mains. These come from existing PROMs often at the
level of the individual questionnaire item [86]. This is rec-
ommended because the scale name used in PROMs and
the scores attributed to the combined items are often
found to be inconsistent. Therefore, analyses at a granular
level are recommended [86]. The full process for this is
described in Fig. 1 of the paper by Macefield et al. At this
stage it is worth extracting details of the patient-reported
outcome development and validity which will be helpful
when selecting measures with which to assess the core
outcomes.
A PRO long list extracted from PROMs may be
supplemented with additional domains derived from a
review of qualitative research studies if time allows
(e.g. [87, 88]). It is recommended that interpretation of
data from qualitative papers is guided by experts in the
field.
2.7.2 Identifying and filling the gaps in existing knowledge
It is important to identify which key stakeholder groups’
views are not encompassed by systematic reviews of
outcomes in published studies or the existing academic
literature more generally, and decide whether these are
gaps that need to be filled. An initial list from published
clinical studies may be supplemented by undertaking
qualitative research with key stakeholders whose views
are important yet unlikely to be represented within sys-
tematic reviews of outcomes in previous studies. Where
resources are limited, consultation with an advisory group
whose membership reflects the key stakeholders may be
used as an alternative to qualitative research, but it should
be noted that such consultation is not qualitative research
and the information arising from it does not have the
same standing as the knowledge generated by research.
Qualitative interviews or focus groups with key stake-
holders, especially patients, are recommended, particularly
if the PROMS have lacked detailed patient participation in
their development. The following section outlines in more
detail how qualitative work may contribute to COS devel-
opment. Nevertheless, it is recommended that qualitative
research is guided by researchers with expertise in these.
Interviews should be performed with a purposeful sample
and use a semistructured interview schedule to elicit
outcomes of importance to that population. The interview
schedule may be informed by the domain list generated
from the academic literature or be more informed by a
grounded theory approach and start with very open ques-
tions. Interviews are audio-recorded, transcribed and ana-
lysed for content. The information can then be used to
create new outcome domains or supplement the long list
[89, 90].
2.7.3 Ontologies for grouping individual outcomes into
outcome domains
Outcome domain models or frameworks exist to attempt
to provide essential structure to the conceptualisation of
domains [91], and have been used to classify outcomes
that have been measured in clinical trials in particular
conditions. Despite their intended use to provide a
framework, there is not always consistency between the
different models. In a review of Health-related Quality
of Life (HRQoL) models, Bakas et al. found that there
were wide
variations in terminology for analogous
HRQoL concepts [91]. Outcome hierarchies have been
proposed for specific conditions [92] and cancer [93].
There have been several frameworks to classify health,
disease and outcomes to date. There are various concep-
tual frameworks relevant to outcomes in health and
these cover somewhat different areas of outcomes, some
of which are described below.
2.7.3.1 Outcome-related frameworks
World Health Organisation (WHO)
The WHO definition of health, although strictly a de-
finition of health, can be considered a framework as it in-
cludes three broad health domains [94]: physical, mental
and social wellbeing. This definition has not been
amended since 1948 but is a useful starting place to study
health. In a scoping review of conceptual frameworks,
Idzerda et al. point out that although the three domains
are clearly outlined, no further information about what
should be included within each domain is provided [95].
Patient-reported Outcomes Measurement Informa-
tion System (PROMIS)
The PROMIS domain framework builds on the WHO
definition of health to provide subordinate domains be-
neath the broad headings stated above [41]: physical
(symptoms and functions), mental (affect, behaviour and
cognition) and social wellbeing (relationships and func-
tion). It was developed for adult and paediatric measures
as a way of organising outcome measurement tools.
World Health Organisation International Classifica-
tion of Functioning Disability and Health (WHO ICF)
The International classification of Functioning, Disability
and
Health
(ICF)
offers
a
framework
to
describe
The Author(s) Trials 2017, 18(Suppl 3):280
Page 12 of 50
 functioning, disability and health in a range of conditions.
The ICF focuses on the assessment of an individual’s func-
tioning in day-to-day life. It provides a framework for
body functions, activity levels and participation levels in
basic areas and roles of social life; providing domains of
biological, psychological, social and environmental aspects
of functioning [96]. In many clinical areas, ICF core sets
have been developed. These core sets identify the most
relevant ICF domains for a particular health condition.
5Ds
5Ds is presented as a systematic structure for represen-
tation of patient outcomes and includes five ‘dimen-
sions’: death, discomfort, disability, drug or therapeutic
toxicity, and dollar cost [97]. This representation of
patient outcome was developed specifically for rheum-
atic diseases, and the authors claim that each dimen-
sion represents a patient outcome directly related to
patient welfare; for example, they describe how a pa-
tient with arthritis may want to be alive, free of pain,
functioning normally, experiencing minimal side ef-
fects and be financially solvent. This framework as-
sumes that outcomes are multidimensional, and it is
critical that the ‘concept of outcome’ is orientated to
patient values.
Wilson and Cleary
Wilson and Cleary [98] propose a taxonomy or classifi-
cation for different measures of health outcome. They
suggest that one problem with other models is the lack
of specification about how outcomes interrelate. They
divide outcomes into five levels: biological and physio-
logical factors, symptoms, functioning, general health
perceptions, and overall quality of life. In addition to
classifying these outcome measures, they propose spe-
cific causal relationships between them that link trad-
itional clinical outcomes to measures of health-related
quality of life. For example, ‘Characteristics of the envir-
onment’ are related to ‘Social and psychological sup-
ports’ which in turn relates to ‘Overall quality of life’.
Ferrans et al. [99] revised the Wilson and Cleary model
to further clarify and develop individual and environ-
mental factors.
Outcome Measures in Rheumatology (OMERACT)
Filter 2.0
The OMERACT Filter 2.0 [31] is a conceptual framework
that encompasses ‘the complete content of what is measur-
able in a trial’. That is, a conceptual framework of measure-
ment of health conditions in the setting of interventions. It
comprises three core areas: death, life impact and patho-
physiological manifestations; it also comprises one strongly
recommended, resource use. These core areas are then fur-
ther categorised into core domains. They liken the areas to
‘large containers’ for the concepts of interests (domains and
subdomains). They recommend that the ICF domains are
also considered under life impact (ICF domains: activity
and participation) and pathophysiological manifesta-
tions (ICF domains: body function and structure). Al-
though OMERACT recommends the inclusion in a
COS of at least one outcome reflecting each core area,
empirical evidence is emerging that this is not always
considered appropriate [48].
Outcome Measures Framework (OMF)
The Outcome Measures Framework (OMF) project was
funded by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Qual-
ity (a branch of the U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services) to create a conceptual framework for de-
velopment of standard outcome measures used in patient
registries [100]. The OMF has three top-level broad do-
mains: characteristics, treatments and outcomes. There
are six subcategories within the outcomes domain: sur-
vival, disease response, events of interest, patient/care-
giver-reported outcomes, clinician-reported outcomes and
health system utilisation. The model was designed so that
it can be used to define outcome measures in a standard
way across medical conditions. Gliklich et al. conclude
that ‘as the availability of health care data grows, oppor-
tunities to measure outcomes and to use these data to
support clinical research and drive process improvement
will increase’.
Survey of Cochrane reviews
Rather than attempting to define outcome domains as
others have done, Smith et al. performed a review of
outcomes from Cochrane reviews to see whether there
were similar outcomes across different disease categor-
ies, in an attempt to manage and organise data [101].
Fifteen categories of outcomes emerged as being prom-
inent across Cochrane Review Groups and encompassed
person-level outcomes, resource-based outcomes, and
research/study-related outcomes. The 15 categories are:
adverse events or effects (AE), mortality/survival, infec-
tion, pain, other physiological or clinical, psychosocial,
quality of life, activities of daily living (ADL), medication,
economic, hospital, operative, compliance (with treat-
ment), withdrawal (from treatment or study) and satis-
faction (patient, clinician, or other health care provider).
The authors recognise that these 15 categories might
collapse further.
2.7.3.2 Use of outcome-related frameworks in core
outcome set studies In the systematic reviews of COS
[14, 39], 17 studies provided some detail about how out-
comes were grouped or classified (Table 3).

Method for classifying/grouping outcomes
Duncan (2000) [225]
Each outcome measure was classified into one of the following categories: death or, at the level of pathophysiological
parameters (blood pressure, laboratory values, and recanalisation), impairment, activity, or participation. Measures were
classified according to the system used by Roberts and Counsell [226], which includes the Rankin/modified Rankin scale as a
measure of activity rather than participation
Sinha (2012) [60]
Each outcome was grouped into one of the following six outcome domains, some of which were further divided into
subdomains: disease activity, physical consequence of disease, functional status, social outcomes and quality of life, side
effects of therapy and health resource utilisation. Where it was unclear which domain was appropriate, this was resolved by
discussion between the authors. Reference given in support of this approach: Sinha et al. 2008 [227]

List developed by staff at institution (but no further detail)
Distler (2008)[228]
The results of this literature search were discussed at the first meeting of the Steering Committee. Based on this discussion, a list
of 17 domains and 86 tools was set up for the first stage of the Delphi exercise to define outcome measures for a clinical trial in
PAH-SSc. Domains were defined as a grouping of highly related features that describe an organ, disease, function, or physiology
(e.g. cardiac function, pulmonary function, and quality of life)
Devane (2007) [173]
Outcome measures addressing similar dimensions or events were discussed by the team and collapsed where possible. For
example, various modes of delivery/birth were presented as ‘mode of birth (e.g. spontaneous vaginal, forceps, vaginal
breech, caesarean section, vacuum extraction)’. This pilot tool was tested for clarity, with a sample of 12 participants,
including 3 maternity care consumers, and subsequently refined
Smaïl-Faugeron (2013)

Because we expected a large diversity in reported outcomes, we grouped similar outcomes into overarching outcome
categories by a small-group consensus process. The group of experts consisted of 6 dental surgeons specialising in paediatric
dentistry, including 3 clinical research investigators. First, the group identified outcomes that were identical despite different
terms used across trials. Second, different but close outcomes (i.e. outcomes that could be compared across studies or combined
in a meta-analysis) were grouped together into outcome domains. Finally, the group, with consensus, determined several out-
come categories and produced a reduced-outcome inventory
Merkies (2006) [229]
In advance of the workshop, a list of outcome measures applied in treatment trials was prepared including their scientific
soundness, WHO and quality of life classification (WHO classification reference is ICF)
Rahn (2011) [230]
From this outcome inventory, the outcomes were organised and grouped into eight proposed overarching outcome domains: 1.
Bleeding; 2. Quality of life; 3. Pain; 4. Sexual health; 5. Patient satisfaction; 6. Bulk-related complaints; 7. Need for subsequent surgical
treatment and 8. Adverse events. Categories were determined based on their applicability to all potential interventions for abnormal
uterine bleeding and the physician expert group’s consensus of their relevance for informing patient choices. Outcomes related to
cost, resource use, or those determined by the review group to have limited relevance for assessing clinical effectiveness were ex-
cluded from categorisation and further analyses
Chow (2002) [231]
Some detail but process not described – the endpoints employed in previous bone metastases trials of fractionation schedules
were identified and listed in the first consensus survey under the following headings: 1. Pain assessments; 2. Analgesic
assessments and primary endpoint; 3. Endpoint definitions; 4. Timing, frequency and duration of follow-up assessment; 5. When
to determine a response; 6. Progression and duration of response; 7. Radiotherapy techniques; 8. Co-interventions following
radiotherapy; 9. Re-irradiation. 10. Non-evaluable patients (lost follow-up) and statistics; 11. Other endpoints; 12. Other new issues
and suggestions and 13. Patient selection issues

A wide variety of different outcomes measures were reported [in the studies included in the systematic review]. We
classified these into 4 categories: postoperative alignment, sensory status, control measures and long-term change
Fong (2014) [139]
Twenty-one maternal and 24 neonatal outcomes were identified by our systematic reviews, one randomised controlled trial and
two surveys. The maternal components included complications associated with pre-eclampsia and were broadly classified under
neurological, respiratory, haematological, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, renal and other categories. The neonatal components
were prematurity-associated complications involving respiratory, neurological, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular systems and
management-based outcomes such as admission to the neonatal unit, inotropic support and use of assisted ventilation
Fraser (2013) [234]
Based on an overall evaluation of intra-arterial head and neck chemotherapy, there are several outcome variables that should be
monitored and reported when designing future trials. These outcome variables can be categorised into ‘Procedure-related’,
‘Disease control’ and ‘Survival’
Goldhahn (2014) [235]
The group reached an agreement to use the ICF thereby identifying key domains within this framework using the nominal
group technique. Recently, the WHO has established core sets for hand conditions [236]. A Comprehensive Core Set of 117
ICF categories were selected appropriate for conducting a comprehensive, multidisciplinary assessment. A brief core set of
23 ICF categories were selected, and considered more appropriate for individual health care professionals. The body
functions contained in this core sets include emotional function, touch function sensory functions related to temperature
and other stimuli, sensation of pain, mobility of joint functions, stability of joint functions, muscle power functions, control
voluntary movement functions, and protective functions of the skin. The group agreed that the ICF categories would be
consistent with clinicians’ current practice patterns of focussing on pain, joint range of motion and hand strength [237]
Saketkoo (2014) [238]
The Delphi process began with an ‘item-collection’ stage called tier 0, wherein participants nominated an unrestricted
number of potential domains (qualities to measure) perceived as relevant for inclusion in a hypothetical 1-year RCT. This

 2.7.3.3 Use of outcomes recommended in core out-
come sets to inform an outcome taxonomy Based on
the classification of outcomes in two previous cohorts of
Cochrane systematic reviews [101, 102] and the out-
comes recommended in 198 COS [14], the following
taxonomy has been proposed:
1. Mortality
– Includes subsets all, cause-specific, quality of
death, etc.
2. Physiological (or Pathophysiological)
– Disease activity (e.g. cancer recurrence, asthma
exacerbation, includes ‘physical consequence of
disease’, etc.)
– Blood pressure, laboratory values, recanalisation
3. Infection
– New, recurrent
4. Pain
5. Quality of life
– Includes Health-related Quality of Life (HRQoL)
6. Mental health
7. Psychosocial (includes behavioural)
8. Function (or Functional status)
– Does this cover activities? Participation? (Read the
Roberts and Counsell paper referenced in the
review of stroke outcomes)
9. Compliance with/withdrawal from treatment
10.Satisfaction
– Reported by patient, health professional, etc.
11.Resource use (or health resource utilisation)
– Includes subset hospital, community, additional
treatment, etc.
12.Adverse events (or side effects)
– Be clear that this could include things like death,
pain, etc. when they are unanticipated harmful
effects of an intervention
Pilot work is underway with selected Cochrane Review
Groups to test the taxonomy for applicability. To date,
one additional outcome domain, knowledge, has been
identified as missing from the list.
2.7.4 Determining inclusion and wording of items to be
considered in the initial round of the consensus exercise
It is important to spend time on this aspect of the process,
in terms of the structure, content and wording of the list
of items, to avoid imbalance in the granularity of item se-
lection and description and ambiguity of language. Partici-
pants in the consensus process may identify such issues,
necessitating revisions to the list during subsequent
rounds [48]. A SAG (see ‘Achieve global consensus’ below)
can provide valuable input at the design stage, prior to the
start of the formal consensus process.
The review of existing knowledge, and research to fill
gaps in that knowledge, has the potential to result in a
long list of items. Consideration is needed regarding
whether to retain the full list in the consensus exercise
or whether to reduce the size of the list using explicit
criteria. Preparatory work on how best to explain the
importance of scoring all items on the list may help to
improve levels of participation.
As noted in the section on qualitative research in
COS development, because qualitative research in-
volves patients and other stakeholders describing their
views and experiences in their own terms, it gives COS
developers access to the words, phrases and language
that patients use to describe how conditions or inter-
ventions affect them. COS developers can, therefore, in-
corporate the words that patients use in interviews and
focus groups to label and explain outcome items in a
Delphi, thereby ensuring that the items are understand-
able and accessible for patients. Pilot or pretesting work
involving cognitive or ‘think aloud’ interviews to examine
Table 3 Methods for classifying/grouping outcomes (n = 17) (Continued)
exercise produced a list of >6700 items—reduced only for redundancy, organised into 23 domains and 616 instruments and
supplemented by expert advisory teams of pathologists and radiologists
Smelt (2014) [159]
We then grouped the answers [from round 1 of the Delphi questionnaires] according to the presence of strong similarity.
During this process, we followed an inductive method, i.e. answers were examined and those considered to be more or less
the same were grouped as one item. No fixed number of items was set beforehand in order to accommodate all new
opinions. The answers were grouped by two of the authors (AS and VdG) separately, to ensure independence of
assessments. Any discrepancies were resolved through a discussion with two other authors (ML and DK) who also checked
whether they agreed with the items as formulated by AS and VdG
Wylde (2014) [137]
The pain features that were retained after the three rounds of the Delphi study were reviewed and systematically categorised
into core outcome domains by members of the research team [86]. The IMMPACT recommendations [239] were used as a
broad framework for this process. Each individual feature was reviewed to determine whether it was appropriate to group it into
an IMMPACT-recommended pain outcome (pain intensity, the use of rescue treatments, pain quality, temporal components of
pain) or a new pain outcome domain. The developed outcomes domains were then reviewed to ensure that the features that
they encompassed adequately reflected the domain and that the features were conceptually similar. These core outcome do-
mains were subsequently discussed and refined by the Project Steering Committee and the PEP-R group

 how patients and other stakeholders interpret the draft
items can help to refine the outcome labels and explana-
tions [103, 104]. As the name suggests, this technique
literally involves asking participants to think aloud as they
work through the draft Delphi and provide a running
commentary on what they are thinking as they read the
items and consider their responses. This allows COS
developers to understand the items from the perspective
of participants. Cognitive interviews are widely used in
questionnaire development to refine instruments and
ensure they are understandable for the target groups.
Other methods previously used to determine the de-
scription of items include a reading-level assessment and
amendment as necessary [55], and a review of termin-
ology used in existing health frameworks such as ICF
[96], PROMIS [41], the Wilson and Cleary model [98] as
well as related COS [48].
2.7.5 Short- or longer-term outcome assessment
One issue to consider is whether, and how, to address
the timing of outcome assessment. Many COS devel-
opers have identified an agreed set of outcomes to meas-
ure, leaving the timing of assessment as an issue for
trialists to decide subsequently depending on their par-
ticular context of use. In an alternative approach, in the
COS for rheumatoid arthritis [26] agreed at a face-to-
face meeting, it is recommended that radiological dam-
age is only measured in trials where the patients are to
be followed up for longer than 1 year. It is recom-
mended that the approach to handling this issue be
made clear to participants from the outset in the subse-
quent consensus process, to avoid ambiguity later on.
2.7.6 Eliciting views about important outcomes
Having identified a list of potential outcomes, the next
step is to assess the level of importance given to each.
Considerations concerning the choice of assessment
method include the need to build a consensus with
methodological rigor, and to adopt strategies to ensure
that a diverse range of opinions is heard.
Methods used in previous studies to elicit opinions
and to develop consensus about important outcomes in-
clude expert panel meetings (sometimes using nominal
group technique (NGT) methods) and Delphi surveys. A
single, heterogeneous consensus panel comprising the
various stakeholders may be deemed appropriate for par-
ticular areas of health care whereas separate panels for
different stakeholder groups followed by work to inte-
grate the multiple perspectives may be more appropriate
for others.
If participants in a consensus process are shown a list
of potential outcomes, we recommend that in general
they should be given the opportunity to propose the in-
clusion of additional items, especially as the academic
literature may not include outcomes associated with the
most recent treatments available or the most pressing
current concerns for stakeholders.
We consider a Delphi exercise to be a useful way of
gaining information about opinion from a wide group of
participants. Of 127 ongoing COS in the COMET data-
base (as of 12 April 2016), 108 (85%) involve a Delphi
survey, and hence we discuss this method in more detail
below.
2.7.6.1 The Delphi technique With the exception of
the Delphi technique, all other methods for COS devel-
opment described earlier involve face-to-face communi-
cation. The Delphi technique is advantageous in that it
is anonymous, avoiding the effect of dominant individ-
uals, and can be circulated to large numbers with wide
geographic dispersion.
The Delphi technique was originally developed by
Dalkey and Helmer (1963) at the Rand Corporation
in the 1950s [105]. In a COS framework, the method
is used for achieving convergence of opinion from ex-
perts (stakeholders) on the importance of different
outcomes in
sequential questionnaires (or rounds)
sent either by post or electronically. Responses for
each outcome are summarised and fed back anonym-
ously within the subsequent questionnaire. Partici-
pants are able to consider the views of others before
re-rating each item and can, therefore, change their
initial responses based on the feedback from the pre-
vious rounds. With no direct communication between
participants this feedback provides a mechanism for
reconciling different opinions of stakeholders and is,
therefore, critical to achieving consensus.
There remains, however, uncertainty as to the optimum
way to use such methodology. Many issues need to be
considered at the outset, all of which may have an impact
on the final results. These include:
1. Number of panels
2. Group size
3. Participant information
4. Number of rounds
5. Structure of the questionnaires
6. Methods of scoring
7. Nature of feedback presented between rounds
8. Criteria for retaining outcomes between rounds
9. Attrition (response bias) between rounds
10.Consensus definitions
11.How the degree of consensus will be assessed
In the following sections, we discuss each of the
above issues in detail and offer guidance on different
approaches.

 Single or multiple panels for different stakeholders
The choice of stakeholder groups to be involved in the de-
velopment of a COS has been discussed in ‘Stakeholder
involvement’ in Chapter 2 above. There may be additional
considerations regarding which groups should be involved
in a Delphi survey. For example, in a COS for early stage
dementia, interviews rather than Delphi survey participa-
tion may be considered to be the more appropriate way to
include patient views.
What also requires consideration is how best to com-
bine the views of different stakeholders within a Delphi
survey. The issue of the impact of panel composition on
Delphi performance has seldom been investigated in
general [106]. Some COS studies have used a single
panel of experts from one particular stakeholder group
or combined a heterogeneous group of participants,
representing multiple stakeholder groups, into a single
panel (that is, ignoring stakeholder status when generat-
ing feedback and assessing consensus). Others have used
multiple homogenous panels, each formed by a different
stakeholder group. In rheumatology, Ruperto et al. [54]
used a single panel of paediatric rheumatologists whilst
developing a COS in systemic lupus erythematosus (JSLE)
and juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM), whilst Taylor et al.
[107] combined the views of rheumatologists and industry
representatives into a single panel in the development of a
COS in chronic gout. The MOMENT study (Management
of Otitis Media with Effusion in Cleft Palate) considered
eight separate stakeholder groups and treated them as
multiple separate panels [55].
The single homogeneous panel approach will result in
core outcomes deemed essential by only one stakeholder
group. If a single panel is formed by combining hetero-
geneous stakeholder groups (such that feedback and cri-
teria for consensus are based on the group overall and
ignore stakeholder type), careful consideration and justi-
fication is needed of the panel mix. If the data are simply
amalgamated with no consideration of the separate
stakeholder groups, the resulting set may depend on the
relative proportions of stakeholders participating or on
weightings that may be used for different groups. As an
example of imbalance in stakeholder representation, the
Taylor et al. study [107] had only three industry repre-
sentatives and the remaining 26 respondents were rheu-
matologists. The single-panel approach here is clearly in
favour of the rheumatologists’ opinions.
In areas where differing stakeholder opinions are ex-
pected, a better approach would be to consider multiple
panels, retaining distinct stakeholder groups when gen-
erating feedback and considering criteria for consensus
(see later sections). The final core set, or outcomes taken
forward to the next stage of COS development, may
then consist of (1) outcomes deemed essential by all
stakeholder groups or (2) outcomes deemed essential by
any stakeholder group. The former option may, there-
fore, result in the most important outcomes for any par-
ticular group being excluded from the core set which
may not be acceptable. At the same time, whilst includ-
ing items deemed essential by any relevant stakeholder
group ensures that outcomes essential to any group are
included, the resulting set may be too extensive to be
practical and it could be argued that in this scenario
consensus has not been achieved since there will be
items that not all groups agreed on. Alternative ap-
proaches will be described in a later section on defining
consensus (see ‘Defining consensus’ below).
Group size
The decision regarding how many individuals to include
in a Delphi process is not based on statistical power and
is often a pragmatic choice. For example, the group size
may be dependent on the number of experts or patients
available within the scope of the COS being developed.
These numbers may be particularly small if the condi-
tion is rare or the intervention of interest is not widely
used. In their international Delphi study, Smith and
Betts (2014) included only 12 acupuncturists working in
pregnancy with at least 5 years’ experience in traditional
Chinese
medical
techniques
[108].
As
a
contrast,
Ruperto et al. (2003) enrolled 174 paediatric rheumatol-
ogists from two professional organisations in an inter-
national
Delphi
survey
[54].
Blazeby
et
al.
(2015)
recruited 185 patients and 126 consultants and specialist
nurses in a UK-based study to identify a COS for surgery
for oesophageal cancer [58], whilst van’t Hooft et al.
(2015) involved 32 parents and 163 health professionals
in an international Delphi survey as part of the develop-
ment of a COS for the prevention of preterm birth [57].
Consideration should be given to the number of partici-
pants that are invited into the Delphi (allowing for attri-
tion between rounds; see later). Dependent on the
consensus definition, the results may be particularly sensi-
tive with smaller numbers of participants. When potential
numbers are small, stakeholder group members could be
pooled, particularly if it is expected that opinions are un-
likely to differ. Typically, such a decision should be done
in consultation with the Steering Advisory Group to en-
sure the appropriateness of the grouping, and without
knowledge of the results. Any revisions to the Delphi
protocol should be documented with reason.
The key consideration with group size is that there
should be good representation from key stakeholder
groups with qualified experts who have a deep under-
standing of the issues. The more participants represent-
ing each stakeholder group the better, both in terms of
the COS being generalisable to future patients and in
convincing other stakeholders of its value.

 Participant information
It is important for all participants to be fully aware of
the purpose of the Delphi survey and what will be ex-
pected of them. This is crucial both in terms of enabling
informed consent and equipping participants to be able
to prioritise and score outcomes. The notion of a COS
and even an outcome may not be clear to all. Participant
Information Sheets may need to use different termin-
ology for different stakeholder groups and should be
piloted in advance. Plain language summaries for pa-
tients and carers, including a description of an outcome,
a COS and a Delphi survey, are available on the COMET
Initiative website [109].
It is also advisable to ensure that the instructions pro-
vided within each round of the Delphi survey reiterate
the overall aim of achieving consensus of a core set of
outcomes.
Number of rounds
A Delphi survey must consider at least two rounds (that
is, at least one round of feedback) to be considered a
Delphi survey. The number of Delphi rounds varies
across different COS development studies. Typically,
COS studies contain two [56, 58, 60, 110] or three
rounds [55, 107, 111]. One study reported six rounds
[112]; however, this included several rounds of open--
ended questions to generate debate in controversial
areas in the field of infant spasms and West syndrome.
Open-ended rounds may also be used to generate an ini-
tial list of outcomes prior to any outcome scoring [60,
113, 114], as an alternative to reviewing the academic lit-
erature for example.
Rather than pre-determining the number of rounds,
the process can be dynamic with subsequent rounds in-
corporated if further prioritisation is warranted. Whilst
we would not expect, nor require, consensus to be
reached on all outcomes in the Delphi questionnaire, it
is necessary that a reduced number of outcomes has
been agreed (in terms of prespecified criteria) to be of
most importance, in order to inform the COS. Outside
COS development work, Custer et al. (1999) have rec-
ommended that three iterations are sufficient to collect
the relevant information to reach a consensus in most
cases [115].
From a practical perspective, the number of rounds
may also be limited by time, cost or consideration of the
burden on participants completing multiple rounds of
Delphi. The time taken for participants to complete a
round of Delphi is highly variable and will often depend
on the number of outcomes being scored. It is advisable
to pilot the questionnaires beforehand to ensure that it
is practical. Typically, each round of Delphi will remain
open for about 2 or 3 weeks, although latter rounds may
be kept open longer if response rates are low to try to
minimise the potential for attrition bias (see later). Fol-
lowing the closure of a Delphi round, an additional 2 or
3 weeks is required to analyse the data and set up the
next round, although this will depend on the design and
can be much shorter if using software developed specif-
ically for online Delphi surveys; for example, the Delphi-
Manager software developed by COMET [116].
Structure of the questionnaires
Careful consideration is needed when designing the
Delphi questionnaire, as for any questionnaire. For ex-
ample, outside of COS development Moser and Kalton
[117]
recommend that jargon
and
technical
terms
should be avoided in questionnaires; anecdotal evidence
from the piloting of Delphi questionnaires for core sets
for cancer surgery and OME with cleft palate suggest
that lay terms are preferred to technical medical terms,
even by health professionals. Stakeholder involvement in
the design and piloting of the Delphi questionnaire is
recommended to ensure that it is accessible, comprehen-
sible and valid.
Order of questionnaire items
Previous research, outside of COS development, has
demonstrated that the order in which questions are pre-
sented in a questionnaire could affect response rates and
actual responses to question items [118]. The idea of the
‘consistency effect’
, where items are answered in relation
to responses to earlier items, has been researched for
more than 50 years with recommendations that general
questions should precede specific ones [119], and ques-
tions should be grouped into topics [120]. It has also
been suggested that if there is evidence that respondents
have stronger opinions on some items than others these
should be placed first [118]. It has been argued that
order effects will be greater for interview surveys and
minimal for written surveys since participants have lon-
ger to respond to items and have the opportunity to look
at all items before responding [121], but effects have
been observed in written surveys [122].
Within the development of a COS we are only aware
of one published abstract reporting the effects of ques-
tion order. For surgery for oesophageal cancer recent
methodological research considered the impact of the
ordering of patient-reported and clinical outcomes in
the Delphi survey. Participants were randomly allocated
to receive a questionnaire with the patient-reported out-
comes presented first and the clinical outcomes last, or
vice versa. The study found that ordering of outcomes in
a Delphi questionnaire may impact on both response
rates and actual responses, hence subsequently im-
pacting on the final core set [123]. Further research is
needed to better understand potential order effects in
the context of COS development. We are aware of an
The Author(s) Trials 2017, 18(Suppl 3):280
Page 18 of 50
 ongoing nested study in which participants are rando-
mised to one of four orderings of the outcomes through-
out the Delphi survey [124].
Additional open questions
As described previously, there are different methods of
identifying an initial long list of outcomes to inform the
Delphi survey. Whatever method is employed the initial
list may not be entirely exhaustive and there may be added
value in including an open question in the round-1 ques-
tionnaire to identify additional outcomes. This open ques-
tion could be placed at the beginning or the end of the
questionnaire depending on the intended purpose.
If placed at the beginning of the questionnaire partici-
pants might be asked to identify a small number of out-
comes that are of most importance to them before they
see the outcomes included in the questionnaire. If placed
at the end, participants might be asked to list any add-
itional items that they do not feel have been considered
in the questionnaire. The former approach will help to
ensure that there are no key outcomes that have been
omitted, whilst the latter approach will help to ensure
that a more exhaustive list of outcomes. Whether in-
cluded at the beginning or end of the questionnaire, cri-
teria for including additional items in round 2 should be
specified in a protocol; for example, any new outcome
suggested may be included, alternatively only those new
outcomes suggested by two or more respondents might
be added.
Scoring system
Core outcome set studies have used a variety of different
scoring systems to rate outcomes within a Delphi process,
although the majority involve a Likert scale. Other methods
include the ranking of outcomes [54, 114] and allocation of
points (for example, division of 100 points across all out-
comes) [110, 114, 125]. The 9-point Likert scoring system
where outcomes are graded in accordance to their level of
importance is a common method. Typically, 1 to 3 signifies
an outcome is of limited importance, 4 to 6 important but
not critical, and 7 to 9 critical [55, 126, 127]. This frame-
work is recommended by the Grading of Recommenda-
tions Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE)
Working Group for assessing the level of importance about
research evidence [21, 128]. Others have used similar
9-point systems. For example Potter et al. [56] and
Blazeby et al. [58] asked participants to rate the im-
portance of each outcome on a 1–9 scale where 1
was ‘not essential’ and 9 was ‘absolutely essential’.
Some studies have also included an ‘unable to score’
category to allow for the fact that some stakeholder
group members may not have the level of expertise
to score certain outcomes. As an example, in the de-
velopment of a COS for otitis media with effusion in
children with cleft palate, some of the participants
from the speech and language therapist stakeholder
group chose not to score some of the outcomes re-
lated to the more clinical aspects of the condition
[55]. Other studies have used four- [129], five- [111] and
seven- [107] point Likert scales to score outcomes.
Feedback between rounds
In order to increase the degree of consensus amongst par-
ticipants, differing views need to be reconciled. The mech-
anism for this within a Delphi process is the feedback
presented to participants in subsequent rounds, enabling
different opinions to be considered before re-rating an
outcome. At the end of each round the results for each
outcome are aggregated across participants and descrip-
tive statistics presented (see later in this section). Partici-
pants can be encouraged to provide a reason for their
scores on individual outcomes, which can be summarised
as part of the feedback.
The generation of these descriptive statistics will de-
pend on whether a single panel or multiple panels have
been used. In a single-panel study, feedback ignores any
distinct
stakeholder
groups
and
summarises
and
presents scores for each outcome for all participants in-
volved, hence hiding any disparate views between stake-
holders. As described earlier, if there are disparate views
the final COS will depend on the relative proportions of
stakeholders. Calculation of summary scores could of
course be weighted by stakeholder group, but it is diffi-
cult to ascertain what weightings should be given and
there is no current guidance on this. In addition, recent
evidence in the development of COS suggests that pa-
tients are more likely than health professionals to rate
an outcome as essential; three studies found that the
average score awarded to outcomes in the round-1 ques-
tionnaire was greater for patients than health profes-
sionals [130], so even in a study involving equal
numbers of patients and health professionals, patients
may be more likely to influence a core set if outcome
scores are simply combined across stakeholder groups.
In a multiple panel study there are three possible ap-
proaches to providing feedback. Participants might re-
ceive an overall average across all stakeholder groups;
however, this would be analogous with the single-panel
approach. Alternatively, participants could receive feed-
back from their own stakeholder group only or from all
stakeholder groups separately. If participants receive
feedback from their own stakeholder group only, whilst
this may enable consensus within stakeholder groups, it
provides no opportunity for consensus across groups.
Ongoing COS projects include nested randomised stud-
ies comparing these three approaches [131, 132].
Recent methodological work, including a before/after
study [55] and nested randomised trials [130], examined
The Author(s) Trials 2017, 18(Suppl 3):280
Page 19 of 50
 the impact of providing feedback from all stakeholder
groups separately compared to feedback from the partic-
ipant’s own group only. Type of feedback presented did
impact on the subsequent scoring of items [55, 130] and
the items subsequently retained at the end of the Delphi
process [130]. The research also demonstrated that pro-
viding feedback to participants from both stakeholder
groups improved consensus between stakeholder groups
in terms of reduced variability in responses and im-
proved agreement in items to retain at the end of the
Delphi process [130].
In some ongoing COS studies, participants are being
asked for the reasons that they have changed scores be-
tween rounds particularly if the change in score is from
critically important to a score of less importance or vice
versa [133, 134]. This will enable us to better understand
the impact of feedback and help optimise the Delphi.
There are a number of ways that feedback can be pre-
sented. A summary statistic, such as a median or mean (if
normally distributed), may be presented for each outcome
[58]. Figure 2 demonstrates how feedback was presented
in round 2 of a Delphi postal survey used within the devel-
opment of a COS for surgery for colorectal cancer. Mean
scores (rounded to the nearest integer) were presented for
both stakeholder groups (patients and surgeons/nurses)
included in the study. The participant’s individual score
from round 1 is also presented. Single summary statistics
are sometimes also presented with a measure of dispersion
such as a standard deviation, interquartile range, range or
other percentiles [107, 126, 127]. Alternatively, the per-
centage scoring above a prespecified threshold (for ex-
ample, 7–9 on a 9-point Likert scale) may be presented
[56]; or, the full distribution of scores may be provided
graphically. Figure 3 provides a screenshot of an electronic
round-2 Delphi questionnaire created within DelphiMana-
ger. In this instance a histogram of round-1 scores is pre-
sented for each stakeholder group. The participant’s
round-1 score is this time highlighted in yellow.
Further research is required to determine which presen-
tation method is most useful and easily interpreted by par-
ticipants; however, the optimum approach may differ
depending on the setting and stakeholder groups involved.
Preparatory work with a small group of participant repre-
sentatives to ensure that the feedback is understood is
advisable.
Retaining or dropping items between rounds
After the initial Delphi round, subsequent rounds might
retain all outcomes [55, 57, 125], or some items may be
dropped according to prespecified criteria [56, 58].
Whilst there are examples of both approaches in the
academic literature, at present there is no empirical evi-
dence of whether the decision impacts on the final core
set. Retaining all items for all rounds may provide a
more holistic approach, enabling participants to score
and prioritise the list of outcomes as a whole. If items
are dropped between rounds there may be items consid-
ered of most importance to some participants which are
not present in later rounds and this may hinder their
ability to prioritise the remaining items. This may be
particularly pertinent when scoring systems require par-
ticipants to allocate a certain number of points across all
outcomes [125]. In addition, if items are dropped after
the first round, participants will not get the opportunity
to re-score those outcomes taking into account feedback
on scores from other participants. Suppose that a par-
ticular outcome is rated highly by patients in round 1
but poorly by other stakeholder groups and that based
on prespecified criteria the outcome is dropped. It is
plausible that had participants seen that patients rated
the outcome highly, other stakeholders would have in-
creased their scores such that the outcome would have
been retained at the end of round 2.
At the same time, if the initial list of outcomes is large,
including them in each Delphi round may impose suffi-
cient burden on participants to increase attrition from
one round to another. If the decision is made to reduce
the number of items from one round to the next, more
inclusive criteria for retaining items in earlier rounds
may be sensible. For example, in the recent development
of a COS for surgery for oesophageal cancer, 67 outcomes
were included in round 1. Criteria for inclusion in round 2
were that an item be rated 7 to 9 (on a 9-point Likert
scale) by 50% or more participants and 1 to 3 by no more
than 15% of participants in at least one stakeholder group
[58]. Items were retained at the end of round 2 using stric-
ter cut-off criteria; retained items were rated between 7
and 9 by over 70% of respondents and 1 to 3 by less than
15% by at least one stakeholder group. Using less stringent
criteria in earlier rounds, and retaining items for which
these criteria are met for any single stakeholder group,

 reduces the likelihood of dropping outcomes that may
have been rated more highly in subsequent rounds had
participants been given feedback on them.
In the absence of any empirical evidence to inform the
optimum approach, the decision may be largely led by
the initial number of outcomes. An intermediate ap-
proach, which may to some extent address the disadvan-
tages of both methods, would be to retain all items
between rounds 1 and 2, hence enabling participants to
re-score in light of feedback for every item, and then
drop items in subsequent rounds. Whatever design used,
if any items are to be dropped from one round to the
next, criteria need to be clearly defined in a protocol.
Attrition and attrition bias
The degree of non-response after the first round of the
Delphi (attrition) may be highly variable between studies
and may be dependent on the timing of Delphi rounds
(for example, holiday season may increase attrition), the
length of the Delphi (from previous knowledge of com-
pleting the previous round), the time elapsed between
the first and final round (health care professionals may
leave the service, or participants may become disinter-
ested), and the method of recruitment of participants, as
well as many other factors. For example, Bennett et al.
(2012) observed 0% attrition in their small Delphi study
(fewer than 10 participants) but their recruitment strat-
egy was a targeted approach to known experts [126],
whereas Smith and Betts (2014) observed higher attri-
tion rates (17%) from 12 participants from inviting trial
authors from the relevant academic literature [108].
Similar attrition rates to Smith and Betts were seen in a
much larger study for oesophageal cancer surgery which
recruited 126 surgeons and nurses identified through a
meeting of the Association of Upper Gastrointestinal
Surgeons of Great Britain and Ireland, and by personal
knowledge of surgeons, and 185 patients recruited from
three clinical centres. Attrition rates between rounds 1
and 2 were 15% for professionals and 17% for patients.
If attrition rates are thought to be too high, either
overall or for a particular stakeholder group, then strat-
egies should be adopted to increase the response rates.
Personalised reminder emails to participants (with de-
tails of current response rates), personalised emails from
distinguished researchers in the field, direct telephone
calls, and the offer of being acknowledged in the study
publication have all been found to be helpful strategies
in increasing response rates. Consideration should be
given to keeping Delphi rounds open longer if it is
thought that this may increase response rates. Whilst
there is no guidance on what constitutes an acceptable
response rate, typically around 80% for each stakeholder
group would be deemed satisfactory in most situations.
Attrition bias will occur when the participants that do
not respond in subsequent rounds have different views
from their stakeholder group peers who continue to
participate. For example, if the feedback a participant re-
ceives suggests that they are in a minority with regard to
their scoring of importance about particular outcomes,
then they may be more likely to drop out, leading to
over-estimation of the degree of consensus in the final
results [135].
Only one study to date has examined whether attrition
bias is present between Delphi rounds in a COS project
[55] although many ongoing COS studies are now plan-
ning to consider this. In the Harman et al. study (2015),
average round-1 scores were calculated for each partici-
pant then plotted according to whether participants
completed round 2 or not. Figure 4 provides two hypo-
thetical scenarios representing the responses from two
different stakeholder groups. In stakeholder group A, we
can see that the average scores for those completing only
round-1 (blue bars) are well contained within those aver-
age scores of those completing round 1 and round 2
(white bars). On average, participants staying in have
scored outcomes similarly to those leaving the study,
suggesting that attrition bias is unlikely to affect the re-
sults. For stakeholder group B, we can see that the aver-
age round-1 scores of those who did not complete
round 2 are lower. If too many participants drop out of
the Delphi process with lower previous round scores
than the majority opinion, this will overestimate the
level of importance of outcomes and over-inflate the de-
gree of consensus.
Inevitably, examining average scores between completers
and non-completers has its limitations. For example, non-
completers may score some outcomes much higher than
completers and score other outcomes much lower than
completers, but average scores may remain similar between
the two groups. Another approach to examine potential at-
trition bias would be to look at average scores of individual
outcomes amongst those who do and not complete later
rounds. If formally comparing average scores through stat-
istical hypotheses tests it should be remembered that there
will be an issue of multiple significance testing and false
positive findings. However, such testing may enable identifi-
cation of obvious patterns or differences in scoring between
the non-completers and completers; for example, if non-
completers are scoring patient-reported outcomes more
highly than clinical outcomes but the reverse is seen for
completers.
COS developers should consider the potential nature
and cause of likely attrition bias when deciding how best
to examine its presence. The assessment of attrition bias
should be repeated for further rounds of the Delphi, that
is, average round-2 scores should be compared for those
completing round 3 and those dropping out after round 2.

 Defining consensus
As for the scoring system, there are numerous ways pro-
posed to define the consensus criteria, although the
choice of criteria is rarely justified [136]; commonly
these relate to a mean or median value for each outcome
or a percentage of participants scoring an outcome as
‘important’. For example, Bennett et al. (2012) defined
‘consensus in’ (outcomes to be included in the COS) to
be those for which 75% or more of participants scored 7
to 9 on a 9-point Likert scale [126], whilst others have
suggested lower or higher rates scoring the categories
deemed to be important. Some studies have also defined
specific conditions or combination criteria as their con-
sensus definition. For example, Schmitt et al. (2011) de-
fined outcomes to be important if at least 60% of the
participants scored 7 to 9 in at least three out of the four
stakeholder groups being considered [127]. Wylde et al.
(2015) implemented a threshold for inclusion in the core
set of 70% of participants scoring outcomes as 7 to 9
and 15% or less scoring 1 to 3 to be met by both the
clinician and patient panels or 90% or more scoring 7 to
9 from any single panel [137].
Williamson et al. (2012), describe the rationale for the
‘70/15%’ consensus definition that was in part used by
Wylde et al. (2015); this approach has been used by
others (Harman (2015) [55], Potter (2015) [56], Blazeby
(2015) [58]) [21]. The idea is that the majority regard
that the outcome should be in the COS, with only a
small minority considering it to have little or no import-
ance. It can similarly be argued that an outcome should
not be included in the COS if the majority (70%) have
scored an outcome of little importance, with only the
small minority (fewer than 15%) consider it to be critic-
ally important.
The choice of what consensus criteria to use is an im-
portant consideration in COS development. Too accom-
modating criteria may result in a long list of outcomes
that are not considered to be minimal whilst too stringent
criteria can potentially exclude key outcomes that may
otherwise have been included in the COS. Regardless of
the consensus criteria that it used, it is important to define
the consensus criteria in a protocol) to avoid any potential
bias from changing the criteria after the Delphi results
have been analysed [138].
Assessing the degree of consensus
Some examination of the degree of consensus in each
round is also advisable in order to ensure that the Delphi
survey is working as a consensus method. As discussed
earlier, the number of rounds in a Delphi can be dy-
namic but there will be a point beyond which a greater
degree of consensus is unnecessary or unlikely to be
achieved. One way to consider the degree of consensus
is to examine the change in individuals’ scores between
rounds. Brookes et al. (2015) [130] and Harman et al.
(2015) [55] calculated the percentage of items for which
a participant changed their score between rounds 1 and
2. Figure 5 presents the findings for the Harman et al.
study. In this particular example, participants changed
their opinions on only a small percentage of outcomes
between rounds (indicated by the positive skew) which
suggests that additional rounds would be unlikely to re-
sult in a much greater degree of consensus. Some on-
going COS studies are documenting the reasons for
change between rounds [133, 134]; this may also help to
determine whether additional rounds are useful.
One metric that may also be useful for examining im-
proved consensus is the reduction in variability of individ-
ual outcome scores between two adjacent rounds. In their
examination of the impact of different feedback methods,
Brookes et al. [130] calculated the standard deviation of
round 1 and round 2 scores for each item in the Delphi
survey. Reductions in the spread of scores were seen
Fig. 4 Average scores in round 1 across all outcomes for (a) stakeholder group 1 and (b) stakeholder group 2. Shaded bars represent those who
provided scores in round 1 only; open bars represent those scoring in both rounds 1 and 2
The Author(s) Trials 2017, 18(Suppl 3):280
Page 23 of 50
 between rounds 1 and 2. Reductions in interquartile
ranges have similarly been examined in this way [139].
Whilst an examination of the degree of consensus is
important to help validate the Delphi survey, it should
be reiterated that the aim of the Delphi survey in the de-
velopment of a COS is to determine which outcomes are
core as opposed to achieving consensus for every out-
come. Hence, it is unnecessary to conduct numerous
rounds until consensus has been reached for all outcomes.
Finally, all methodological decisions should be fully re-
ported and explained in the main publication. Any revi-
sions to the original protocol should be documented
with reasons. This will be covered in more detail in
‘Reporting guidance’ below.
2.7.6.2 Face-to-face meeting We recommend that rep-
resentatives of key stakeholder groups have the oppor-
tunity for discussion of the results of the surveys to agree
a final core set and undertake additional voting if required
before a final COS is agreed.
Evidence for how such meetings are designed and con-
ducted is lacking and published experience limited. A re-
view identified just 10 examples of which nine included
a face-to-face meeting [65]. Most held one meeting al-
though a few studies undertook two or three. Some used
a nominal group technique method to reach consensus
although the majority had informal approaches. A nom-
inal group technique allows all opinions to be consid-
ered initially, eliminates duplicate ideas and then asks
participates to rank the importance of the remaining
opinions [140]. This differs from traditional methods for
decision-making which focus on the largest group ini-
tially supporting an idea.
Most meetings lasted about half a day, included some
sort of voting and included presentations and discus-
sion. Details of who moderated the meetings were often
lacking.
Involving patients in consensus meetings
Another challenge in undertaking a COS study with pa-
tients as participants is that of enabling their inclusion
in consensus meetings. This may, in part, be influenced
by whether or not all stakeholders are brought together
in a consensus meeting or whether these are run separ-
ately for patient participants. There are issues of power
when multiple stakeholders work together to seek agree-
ment. Spoken language and non-verbal communication
in such meetings can exclude or subtly undermine pa-
tient participants. Some COS developers recommend
that face-to-face consensus meetings are held separately
for patients and professionals to allow patients’ views to
be heard without contamination from other parties [56].
Other groups have brought patients and professionals to-
gether to discuss their views alongside evidence arising
from a Delphi survey [55] and to make recommendations
about a COS. With such mixed views, there is a need for
research into this aspect of the consensus process.
Good facilitation is crucial, regardless of whether sep-
arate or combined consensus meetings are held. The
preparation and support of patient participants both be-
fore and during the meeting is also vital. Consideration
needs to be given to the specific needs of the patient
group as they may have particular requirements to en-
able them to fully participate. The common principles in
ensuring an accessible venue obviously apply, but there
may be other considerations; for example, fatigue or pain
from prolonged sitting need to be considered in plan-
ning such meetings. De Witt et al. (2013) provide infor-
mation on barriers to participation for patients with
rheumatological conditions in a face-to-face consensus
meeting and make recommendations for facilitating their
participation [141].
Other issues to consider
A crucial decision to be made is who to invite to the
face-to-face meeting. Some COS developers have invited
only the Steering Group involved in the project, which
may or may not be those involved in an early Delphi
study. Others have invited a combination of Steering
Group members and other Delphi participants. An ap-
proach that may be helpful is to decide on the total
number attending (which may be limited by resource
and/or timing), and then to consider the desirable num-
ber from each stakeholder group. Some COS developers
have aimed to include an equal split of health profes-
sionals and patients [133]. If Delphi participants are to
be invited, some COS developers have included a final
Fig. 5 Percentage of scores changed between rounds 1 and 2 after
viewing the results by stakeholder group
The Author(s) Trials 2017, 18(Suppl 3):280
Page 24 of 50
 question in the survey about willingness to participate in
a face-to-face meeting [133]. Participants for the meeting
are then randomly selected from Delphi completers who
noted that they were interested in attending. The advan-
tage of this approach is that one can check that the final
Delphi round scores are comparable for those attending
and not attending which may give some reassurance that
due consideration will be given to the evidence from the
Delphi study.
Based on experience of consensus meeting facilita-
tion, we recommend that the following further issues
are considered: whether the facilitator needs relevant
clinical experience or methodological experience, or
whether co-facilitators may be appropriate; the inde-
pendence of the facilitator; the ability of the facilitator
to bring everyone in to the discussion without pressure;
that the time needed for the meeting will depend on
the aims and the number of outcomes to be considered;
the structure for the meeting, and whether any small
group or breakout group discussions will be held. We
recommend that attendees are sent a reminder of their
personal Delphi scoring prior to the meeting. The ob-
jectives of the project and the meeting should be made
clear at the start, in terms of the scope of the COS, the
emphasis
on
identifying
core
outcomes,
and
the
methods to be used on the day. Thought should be
given to the order of presentation of outcome results
since it may be better to take the outcomes in groups/
domains. Time should be allowed for at the end of the
meeting to review the recommended list of outcomes
holistically and agree the next steps which may include
determining how each outcome should be defined and
measured.
If a consensus meeting is to form part of the COS
study, teams may need to consider how to address lan-
guage issues in the meeting for non-native language
speakers. If interpreters are to be used it is important to
ensure that they are qualified to undertake that role, and
meeting participants are reminded to speak in plain lan-
guage to reduce the likelihood of difficulties with inter-
pretation. A member of the team should brief the
interpreters prior to the meeting, as to the purpose of
the meeting, to discuss issues of confidentiality and to
emphasise that information should not be filtered as this
may bias responses. In planning the project, it is import-
ant to ensure that interpreting services are appropriately
budgeted for. Interpretation issues are complex and we
recommend that research teams seek advice from their
own organisations as we have only provided a few basic
considerations in this text.
2.8 Determining the core outcome set
The development of a COS may involve several compo-
nents. Consideration should be given in advance to the
criteria that will be used to determine when consensus
has been achieved. Specification of the decision-making
process to determine the final COS should be given in
the study protocol which should reduce the risk that the
people leading the process will define consensus post-
hoc in a way that would bias the conclusions toward
their own beliefs. For example, a study advisory commit-
tee (see Achieve global consensus’ below) may oversee
the process whereby a review of the academic literature
combined with stakeholder interviews informs a Delphi
survey, the results of which are presented at a face-to-
face meeting of representative stakeholders, and either
ratified (in the case of an outcome meeting a pre-
defined consensus definition for the Delphi survey) or
further discussed and a decision made.
It is important to ensure that views from all key stake-
holder groups are considered when making the final de-
cision regarding the COS, and that the process for
reaching that decision is reported transparently.
Researchers should consider the potential impact of the
following methodological decisions on the final results:
group composition, questioning technique, the informa-
tion that participants receive to inform their answers,
whether or not responses are anonymous, how the group
participants interacted with, or influenced, each other, the
medium of the interaction, attrition bias, analysis which
can miss or overstate the importance of certain outcomes,
and the way in which consensus is reached.
All of the above require further investigation to de-
velop transparent, reproducible and robust methods for
decision-making during the COS development process.
Until this is available it is recommended that reporting
details of the process undertaken follows the recom-
mended guidelines [142].
2.9 Qualitative methods in core outcome set development
As indicated throughout this handbook, COS develop-
ment can involve several different stages as well as a mix
of both research and consensus processes. Some COS
developers
have
recently
started
to
use
qualitative
methods as part of the wider COS development process
[55, 74, 89, 133, 143, 144]. In this context qualitative
methods may be useful for accessing the perspectives of
groups, such as patients, carers, members of the public
and health professionals, whose views may not be
encompassed in systematic review of outcomes. Making
COS development meaningful for these groups can be
challenging and, as we outline below, qualitative methods
can help COS developers to navigate this challenge.
However, it is important to note that much remains
to be learnt about the use of qualitative research in
COS development and this section is based on experi-
ence of a limited number of projects.
The Author(s) Trials 2017, 18(Suppl 3):280

 2.9.1 Why use qualitative methods in core outcome set
development?
2.9.1.1 To identify outcomes of relevance to the
whole community of stakeholders COS developers
may conduct systematic reviews of the outcomes mea-
sured in published studies to develop ‘long lists’ of out-
comes to go forward to consensus processes such as a
Delphi survey. However, the opinions of clinical trial de-
signers and researchers will inevitably have influenced
the outcomes used in published studies and these same
opinions will also be reflected in the findings of system-
atic reviews. Patients, carers and the public have histor-
ically had little say in what outcomes are measured in
studies, so systematic reviews can overlook important
outcomes. For example, the OMERACT group have
pointed to how fatigue – an outcome of crucial import-
ance to patients – was overlooked in rheumatology trials
until relatively recently [28]. Qualitative studies with pa-
tients and other stakeholders can help to ensure that the
long lists of outcomes that go forward to a consensus
process are comprehensive from the perspective of the
whole community of relevant stakeholders, not just the
groups that have historically influenced what outcomes
are measured in research.
2.9.1.2 To preserve the distinctive perspective of
different stakeholders Most people do not naturally
think or talk about their experiences of health conditions,
illness and treatments within an outcomes or research
frame of reference [145]. In order for patients and other
stakeholders to participate meaningfully in consensus pro-
cesses, such as Delphi surveys, COS teams need to help
them to understand what outcomes are, how these are
used in trials and why COS are needed. This involves pa-
tients learning things about research which, by definition,
involves influencing them. This learning could also po-
tentially diminish the distinctiveness of their perspectives
as patients. Qualitative studies can enable patients and
other stakeholders to participate in COS development in
ways that minimise such influences. For example, qualita-
tive interviews involve asking participants open questions
and allowing them to respond in their own words. Rather
than asking patients to learn about outcomes or why COS
are needed, the researcher adapts to the patients’ world
and works within their existing capabilities. The overall
purpose of the qualitative research must of course be
clearly explained, but with a well-thought out qualitative
study design and prompt guide (interview schedule)
patients can describe their experiences of illness and treat-
ment in ways that are both intrinsically meaningful to
them and which simultaneously help the COS developer
to identify what outcomes are important to patients.
2.9.1.3 To help make consensus processes accessible
to patients When patients and carers come to rate or
vote on lists of outcomes during consensus processes, the
outcomes need to make sense to them. Because qualitative
research involves patients describing their views and expe-
riences in their own terms, it gives researchers insight into
how patients naturally conceptualise outcomes and the
language they use. COS developers can use the findings
from interviews and focus groups to make subsequent
consensus processes accessible to patients. This might be
by using the qualitative findings to take account of the pa-
tient perspective in deciding on the scope of a COS, and
to ensure that the labelling and explanation of outcomes
is understandable to patients.
2.9.1.4 To inform deliberations in the final stages of
core outcome set development Qualitative study find-
ings can also illuminate why outcomes are important to
patients, which may usefully inform the final stages of
COS development if there is divergence between stake-
holders about which outcomes are core and which are not.
2.9.1.5 To address gaps in existing core outcome sets
Where an existing COS has been developed without the
perspective of patients or other key stakeholders, quali-
tative studies may help to address this omission. This
would usually be as part of a wider review process as
described in Chapter 3.
2.9.2 In what circumstances might core outcome set
developers consider using qualitative methods?
Whilst qualitative methods can be helpful for the rea-
sons described above, we recommend that they are usu-
ally used as part of wider COS development process.
Qualitative studies are not designed to include large rep-
resentative samples and so these designs are not suitable
for estimating how many patients think that a particular
outcome is important. Moreover, qualitative research
studies are not consensus processes and analysis of
interview or focus group data leaves considerable room
for interpretation. Whilst this analysis can be docu-
mented and public research partners and other team
members can be involved, to achieve a final COS that
users will have confidence in COS developers will need
to use processes that have been specially designed to
reach consensus.
In deciding whether to incorporate qualitative methods
as part of a wider COS development process, developers
should consider the following:
� The specific purpose for which qualitative evidence
is needed.
Whilst qualitative methods can be used to access
the perspectives of patients, carers and other
The Author(s) Trials 2017, 18(Suppl 3):280
Page 26 of 50
 stakeholders [133, 146] developers will find it helpful
to specifically consider what it is that they are
hoping to achieve through the qualitative work, and
whether a qualitative approach is the most suitable
way to achieve these aims. For example:
о A COS developer may be concerned that not
all potentially important outcomes have been
identified to go forward to a consensus process
and will use qualitative work to help ensure
that no potentially important outcomes are
missed
о Retention of Delphi participants over several
rounds can be problematic and qualitative studies
may help to minimise the number of Delphi
rounds needed. For example, qualitative research
may enable developers to omit the initial ‘blank
page’ or open-ended round of a Delphi survey
о COS developers may be working with
stakeholder groups, such as patients with
dementia or learning disabilities, for whom other
COS development activities are unsuitable
о As we note above, qualitative research findings
may also help developers to define the scope of a
COS by informing the choice of population and
interventions to be covered by a particular COS
о As also noted above, qualitative research
findings may help to ensure the consensus process
(language, explanations, etc.) is accessible to
patients
о COS developers may need insights on why
particular outcomes are important to patients;
qualitative research is widely regarded as being
useful in addressing ‘why’ questions
� Whether existing qualitative studies have been
conducted that could address some of these aims.
Many qualitative studies have now been published
describing patients’ and carers’ experiences of
specific conditions and treatments. It may be
possible to use this existing work to identify how
well outcomes from systematic reviews of trials map
to those of patients. Similarly, qualitative datasets
may be available for secondary qualitative analysis
that could serve the same aims. If previous
qualitative evidence or data are available, COS
developers will want to be clear about why
additional primary qualitative research is needed.
� Qualitative research requires specialist
methodological expertise and COS developers
will need to ensure that their team includes this
expertise. Similarly, the collection and analysis of
interview or focus group data requires time and
resource and COS development teams will also
need sufficient funds to support the qualitative
work.
2.9.3 Issues to consider in designing primary qualitative
research to inform core outcome set consensus processes
It is beyond the scope of this section to provide guidance
on how to do qualitative research. This is already cov-
ered by an extensive literature. However, there are some
specific issues in conducting qualitative research within
COS development that may be particularly relevant for
COS developers. Before turning to these we would like
to emphasise that the issues we identify below are not
exhaustive. We hope that COS developers will reflect
critically on our suggestions, rather than regarding them
prescriptively.
2.9.3.1 How the qualitative research and patient
involvement complement one another To an extent
qualitative research and the involvement of public re-
search partners may share similar overall goals. For ex-
ample, both may aim to optimise the accessibility of the
language used in the consensus process. Nevertheless,
the contributions of public research partners, though
crucial in COS development, cannot substitute for quali-
tative research.
2.9.3.2 Sampling COS developers will usually aim to
access participants who have direct experience of the ill-
ness, treatment or care process relevant to the COS as
patients or service users. Additionally, the perspectives
of carers, parents or professionals may also be valuable,
for example where the capacity of patients to articulate
their experiences is limited or where carers’ perspectives
on outcomes are of interest in their own right. Sampling
to qualitative studies is usually purposive (e.g. aiming for
maximum diversity), rather than probabilistic (aiming
for statistical representativeness [147]), but it should be
noted that purposive sampling is not the same as con-
venience sampling. Whilst patient organisations or char-
ities
might
offer
a
convenient
route
for
accessing
stakeholders, individuals who are contactable via such
organisations may differ in important ways from the wider
community of patients. If COS are to reflect the perspec-
tives of this wider community, developers will want to ac-
cess patients across a spectrum of sociodemographic and
other characteristics. Sampling via different clinical, health
and community settings will likely be best suited to this.
2.9.3.3 Eliciting participants’ perspectives We have
noted above that qualitative research may be particularly
useful in COS development because it enables partici-
pants to talk about their priorities in their own terms.
Even without an overt focus on outcomes or COS [148]
– a frame of reference which may confuse patients and
shape or colour what they say – much can be learnt
from patients’ naturalistic accounts of their experiences
and perspectives. A narrative style of interviewing can
The Author(s) Trials 2017, 18(Suppl 3):280
Page 27 of 50
 be helpful here, particularly at the outset of an interview.
Beyond this, the questions and prompts can be more
overtly focussed on outcomes although questions still
need to be tailored to the participant group and topic,
and be responsive to individual participants. As well as
examining the qualitative academic literature relevant to
COS development, in designing the interviews and prompt
guides qualitative researchers should consult with patient
research partners [149]. We offer the following further sug-
gestions as tentative pointers and hope that COS devel-
opers will treat them only as starting points for developing
their own questions and prompts:
� Interviews might begin by asking participants to talk
about their actual experiences, including how the
illness and treatment has affected their lives, about
treatment decisions, how these decisions were made
and what influenced them.
� Over the course of an interview, questions may
become more focussed on outcomes and opinions;
for example, asking patients what they had hoped
for from their previous treatments or what they
would want from a new treatment if one became
available. Understandably, many patients with
chronic conditions might hope for curative
treatments and interviewers may need to be
prepared to prompt patients to describe
expectations that are more immediately achievable.
� Towards the end of interviewing, questions might
become more research- or COS-specific. For ex-
ample, the interviewer might summarise outcomes
that patients have discussed in previous interviews
and explore what words or phrases patients think
researchers should use to label or explain outcomes
for future patients.
� Where the qualitative work has a very specific focus;
for example, informing an online Delphi survey for a
particular stakeholder group, interviewing might focus
on a prototype of the survey and use think-aloud
techniques [103, 104] to explore how stakeholders in-
terpret the outcomes and how the phrasing might be
refined.
2.9.3.4 Data analysis COS developers have drawn on a
range of analytical orientations or approaches to qualita-
tive analysis such as framework analysis [150], constant
comparative method [146] thematic analysis, as well as
interpretive phenomenological analysis [151]. Qualitative
researchers will be best placed to identify an approach
that best suits their aims. If interviews have been broad
ranging or narrative, from an early point it will be im-
portant yet challenging to focus the analysis on those
aims that are most pressing. For example, identifying
what outcomes to go forward to the consensus process
and how these are labelled may need to take precedence
over identifying why certain outcomes are important to
patients. As for any qualitative analysis, interpretation
will need to contextualise the data and not just catalogue
data extracts. This will mean considering what things
patients might be reluctant to speak about as well as
what might be taken for granted in the context of cer-
tain illnesses or treatments. In interviews stakeholders
may not directly articulate some outcomes and identify-
ing these may call for considerable interpretive work.
For example, it took considerable qualitative work to
identify empowerment as an outcome of genetic coun-
selling [152, 153]. Finally, whilst qualitative researchers
are likely to lead the analysis, they will want to closely
involve other members of the COS development team,
including the public research partners, to ensure the
analysis is informed by a range of perspectives.
2.9.3.5 Writing up the findings Guidance is available on
writing up qualitative research [154], so here we focus on
those aspects that may warrant particular consideration by
COS developers. It should be clear what has been discov-
ered from the qualitative work (i.e. how the findings add to
what was previously known) and how the qualitative work
has contributed to the COS development process. This
might include a commentary on whether the qualitative
work has identified potentially important outcomes beyond
those already identified in systematic reviews of trial out-
comes, how the qualitative work has informed the scope of
the COS or how it has informed the language used in con-
sensus process. COS developers will need to decide
whether to publish the qualitative research separately from
the other elements of the COS development process, or
combine all elements in one article. Where the qualitative
research is combined with other elements of the COS de-
velopment process, authors may find it helpful to consult
articles on writing up mixed-methods research [155].
Where the qualitative findings are published separately, it
should be clear that the qualitative study is linked to the
wider COS development process so that subsequent COS
developers can learn from this work and unnecessary dupli-
cation can be avoided.
2.10 Considerations to enhance patient participation in a
core outcome set
There are numerous challenges in facilitating patient par-
ticipation in a COS study and these will depend on the pa-
tient group and the methods chosen. In the following
discussion we explore some key challenges for patient
participation in consensus processes such as Delphi stud-
ies. Patient participation through qualitative methods was
discussed in the previous section. A checklist to support
COS developers working with patient research part-
ners in designing COS studies is available on the
The Author(s) Trials 2017, 18(Suppl 3):280
Page 28 of 50
 COMET website and may help with planning to ad-
dress some of these challenges at the outset.
2.10.1 Accessing patients
Involving patients as participants in COS will require
consideration of the need for ethical approval in each
country where the study is taking place. The current
situation in the UK is that ethical permission is required
if the goal of COS development is to produce generalis-
able knowledge. Guidance regarding the need for ethical
approval has been developed by the COMET PoPPIE
(People and Patient Participation, Involvement and En-
gagement) Group [156].
Like any study with this aim, accessing patients or
other groups to participate in a COS study requires con-
sideration of sampling strategies as appropriate to the
research method being used. Patients may be sampled
from primary, secondary and/or tertiary health care set-
tings depending on the condition under study. The ap-
proaches for accessing patient participants may depend
on whether participants are being sought for an online
or face-to-face Delphi survey. Methods for accessing pa-
tients may also depend on whether the patient partici-
pants are being asked to join a consensus meeting with
other stakeholders, where COS developers may specific-
ally decide to select patients who can take on advocacy
roles in this context and so help to ensure that the pa-
tient perspective gets heard.
Patient organisations may provide a route to access pa-
tients for certain conditions but their members may have
special interests and may differ from the wider patient
population (in terms of age, gender, socioeconomic sta-
tus, ethnicity and other relevant characteristics). If pa-
tient organisations are to be used, purposive sampling
techniques may help to ensure that a diverse sample is
accessed. Patient communities also exist in social media,
but COS developers need to be cautious about using
them. There is evidence of poor response rates through
social media and those who do respond may include a
limited range of the patient population due to self-
selection [157]. Links to guidance on the use of social
media can be found on the COMET website. COS devel-
opers also need to ensure that patients or patient advo-
cates from patient organisations have relevant experience
of the condition and that this experience is relatively re-
cent. Further discussions about sampling of patients to
take part in a COS can be found in the previous section.
In terms of promoting the COS study to potential par-
ticipants, COS developers might consider a range of
sources; for example, clinic waiting areas and through
patient organisations and they might also plan for how
to promote the study within hard-to-reach communities.
Patient organisations and public research partners can
help to advise on where studies might best be promoted
for patients with a particular condition.
2.10.2 Information for patients
The way that COS studies are explained, finding the right
language to do so and asking questions about outcomes
with a range of stakeholders are other key challenges.
COMET has developed two plain language documents
with the involvement of patients: one explains what COS
are and what the COMET Initiative is; the other describes
what a Delphi study is. These resources can be found on
the COMET website [109] and may be useful in develop-
ing information for COS studies.
When communicating with patients and when devel-
oping written study information and questions about
outcomes, it is important to use plain language. Free re-
sources to help with writing in plain language are avail-
able online. Specific guidance on writing for people with
particular needs, such as adults with learning disabilities,
might also be sought where relevant, e.g. easy-read pub-
lications. Readability tools are also available to provide
an indication of how readable study material is. For fur-
ther information on relevant resources to help with writ-
ing and assessing readability see the COMET website.
Considering how to present written information can
help with ensuring its accessibility. Any specific visual
needs, such as colour blindness or sight problems, also
need considering when designing participant materials.
For certain populations and if funding allows, it may be
appropriate to provide information about the study
through other media; for example, podcasts or video pre-
sentations. Consulting with patients and patient organisa-
tions in the design stage of the study will help to identify
the most accessible means of providing information and
ensuring its acceptability to the relevant groups.
2.10.3 What questions to ask when involving patients as
participants in a core outcome set study?
Asking the overarching question about which outcomes
are relevant and important to patients can be difficult as
the word ‘outcomes’ may not commonly be understood.
Providing examples of outcomes in conditions can be use-
ful, but care needs to be taken in selecting an example that
will not bias respondents. In a systematic review of COS,
Gargon et al. (2014) found that the precise question used
to ask about outcomes was not always reported [14]. It is
important that we report on such aspects of study design
so that we can develop best ways of engaging patients as
participants in future COS studies.
Patient involvement is important in developing ques-
tions for use in a COS study. Examples that we know
about are from the ACORN and the MoMENT studies.
The Acne Core Outcome Research Network (ACORN)
consulted with patients and clinicians when developing
The Author(s) Trials 2017, 18(Suppl 3):280
Page 29 of 50
 their question for a COS study on acne. They showed
patients several questions and asked which would be the
most appropriate to use in a survey to include patients.
Following this consultation they decided on the ques-
tion: ‘Please tell us in your own words how you decide if
your treatment has been effective. Physicians do things
like counting spots or using an improvement scale but
how do you, or will you, do it?’ This question was incor-
porated into a James Lind Alliance Priority Setting Part-
nership international survey about research priorities for
acne [158]. The MoMENT study (described below) de-
veloped their question through their study group with
the involvement of the chief executive from a patient or-
ganisation and then piloted their question with patients.
Further examples of how researchers have previously
asked patients/carers about outcomes of importance are
presented below. Some questions focus on treatment
and others focus on the patient experience of a condi-
tion [89]. The scope of the COS may influence the type
of questions used; for example, particular question types
might work best for COS where the scope relates to a
particular type of intervention, whilst other studies may
work better with more generic experiential questions:
� The MoMENT study [55] – this was a study to
develop a COS for the management of otitis media
with effusion in children with cleft palate. A
consensus survey was used in this study. Parents
were presented with a list of outcomes to score but
could add in any missing outcomes that they
considered relevant. The question used was: ‘Think
about when your child had glue ear and how you
might decide if their treatment for glue ear had
worked. We would like you to look at the list below
and tell us how important each thing on this list is
in deciding if treatment has worked’ [55].
� An online Delphi consensus study was
conducted with patients who suffered from
migraine. The patients were asked two open-ended
questions in round 1 of the Delphi survey and
these were:
о What do you find most bothersome about
having a migraine attack?
о If a new medicine was developed against
migraine attacks, what would you wish the effect
of this medication to be [159]
� A COS was developed for children with asthma [60].
In an online Delphi survey, parents, young people
and clinicians were asked open-ended questions in
round 1 to identify outcomes of importance. The
following four open-ended questions were used with
the parents and young people:
о Over the last 12 months, have you generally felt
that the regular preventer treatment that your
child (you) takes has kept their asthma under
control? Yes/No. If you ticked ‘Yes’, please tell us
what aspects of your child’s (your) asthma, or
their daily life, have made you feel happy that they
are on the correct regular medication. If you
ticked ‘No’, please leave this question blank
о Over the last 12 months, have there been times
when you felt that your child’s (your) regular
preventer treatment should be increased or
changed because their (your) asthma was not
under control? Yes/No. If you ticked ‘Yes’, please
tell us the reasons why you were not satisfied with
the regular preventer treatment that they (you)
were taking? If you ticked ‘No’, please leave this
space blank
о Does anything worry you about the fact that
your child (you) has asthma? Yes/No. If you ticked
‘Yes’, please tell us the worries you have about the
fact your child (you) has asthma. If you ticked
‘No’, please leave this space blank
о Does anything worry you about the regular
preventer treatment that your child (you) takes for
their asthma? Yes/No. If you ticked ‘Yes’, please
tell us what worries you have about the treatment
your child takes for their asthma. Please be as
specific as you can. If you ticked ‘No’, please leave
this question blank
2.10.4 Maintaining patient involvement throughout a
consensus process
Consensus processes, such as Delphi surveys, may run
over several months and strategies to maintain the in-
volvement of patients in this process are important. In-
volving patients and patient organisations in designing
and overseeing the COS may help COS developers to plan
for this at the outset. Regular communication with partici-
pants in COS may be important in maintaining their en-
gagement – for example, updates on the progress of the
study and forewarning of anticipated dates of subsequent
survey rounds. Some researchers have considered in-
centives; for example, prize draws, as a mechanism for
maintaining participation. Ethical guidance will need to be
sought for this and patients involved in designing your
COS study can help developers to identify the most ap-
propriate incentives for particular patient groups; for ex-
ample, young people may prefer a different incentive than
those of other generations.
2.10.5 Disseminating survey results to patients/the patient
population
Having taken the time to be involved in a COS study, pa-
tients should be offered access to the survey results in an
accessible way and the results may also be of interest to
the wider patient population; for example, through patient
The Author(s) Trials 2017, 18(Suppl 3):280
Page 30 of 50
 organisation newsletters. The rules of plain English again
apply (see above) in developing such end-of-study infor-
mation and patient research partners can help teams de-
sign accessible end-of-study information. Morris et al.
(2015) involved public research partners throughout their
research and in writing the end-of-study information for a
‘children with neuro-disability’ study (which included a
COS) [79]. Links to this end-of-study information can be
found on the COMET website.
2.11 Determining ‘how’ to define and measure an
outcome in the core outcome set
The text above discusses the approach to establishing
consensus about what outcomes are important to meas-
ure. Consensus is also needed on how selected outcomes
should be defined and measured. Of 227 published COS,
84 (37%) considered both the what and the how to
measure in the same study [14, 39]. A review of methods
used in these studies to determine how to measure the
chosen outcomes is currently underway.
Different outcomes may be measured by a single ques-
tion, a questionnaire, a performance-based test, a phys-
ical examination, a laboratory measurement, an imaging
technique, and so forth. A variety of either definitions,
measurement instruments or devices is often found to
be used for the same outcome. For example, in a review
of outcomes for colorectal cancer surgery some 17 dif-
ferent definitions were identified for ‘anastomotic leak-
age’ [85]. In a review of PROMs from studies evaluating
radical treatment for oesophageal cancer, searches iden-
tified 21 generic and disease-specific PROMs containing
116 scales and 32 single items with 94 different verbatim
names [86].
2.11.1 Choice of measurement instrument for an outcome
Evidence synthesis is further hampered by incomparable
scores from different instruments and variability in the
quality (reliability and validity) of measures used [35].
Guidance is needed on how to select the best instrument
for a given outcome.
A joint initiative between COMET and COSMIN
aimed to address this gap by developing a guideline on
how to select outcome measurement instruments for
outcomes included in a COS [160].
Based on a Delphi study amongst a panel of inter-
national experts, consensus was reached on four main
steps in the selection of outcome measurement instru-
ments for a COS:
Step 1. Conceptual considerations
Step 2. Finding existing outcome measurement
instruments, by means of a systematic review and/or a
literature search
Step 3. Quality assessment of outcome measurement
instruments, by means of the evaluation of the
measurement properties and feasibility aspects of
outcome measurement instruments
Step 4. Generic recommendations on the selection of
outcome measurement instruments for outcomes
included in a COS
This consensus-based guideline can be used in defin-
ing how to measure core outcomes for any disease or
condition in health and social care [44].
It may be that several measurement scales exist for
measuring a particular outcome, such that steps 2 and 3
may take some time. As an example, fatigue was identi-
fied by patients with rheumatoid arthritis to be an im-
portant
outcome
to
be
included
in
the
COS.
A
systematic search for articles measuring fatigue discov-
ered 23 scales. Applying the OMERACT Filter for truth,
discrimination and feasibility, six were found to have
sufficient evidence of validity to pass most criteria [30].
In 2006, fatigue was endorsed as an additional core out-
come at the OMERACT 8 meeting following further
work, undertaken to demonstrate responsiveness [30].
In general, it is recommended that once all definitions,
tests, questionnaires, techniques, etc. for measuring a
particular outcome have been identified, and their prop-
erties assessed, a further consensus process should be
undertaken to agree how each should be measured.
2.12 Achieve global consensus
To compare and contrast all research in a topic area, a
COS must be applicable and adopted across relevant set-
tings and disciplines including internationally where
appropriate.
Of the 227 COS studies that were identified in the sys-
tematic review, the majority have involved collaborators
(n = 180, 79%) and participants (n = 154, 68%) from Eur-
ope and/or North America. In contrast, the remaining
continents have been involved as collaborators in just
over one fifth of studies (n = 47; 21%) and have partici-
pated in less than one third of studies (n = 73; 32%). The
geographical locations of collaborators and participants
who have been involved in developing COS are pre-
sented in Table 4.
Health professionals from multiple countries have
been engaged through both professional societies [59]
and personal networks [161, 162]. The inclusion of pa-
tients from multiple countries is likely to be more diffi-
cult. Some groups have included patients from different
countries but usually in small numbers based on per-
sonal contact [161]. A novel approach involves health
professionals interviewing several patients in multiple
countries following training and according to a common
protocol [163].

Page 31 of 50
 Interviews with COS developers have highlighted
some of the considerations of undertaking this work
internationally [65]. A prominent question amongst COS
developers interviewed was whether a COS should be de-
veloped internationally. This links to the intended reach
of the COS recommendations. If the COS is intended to
be used globally then this has implications for how COS
are developed, who is involved in that process and the re-
sources required. There was no consensus amongst those
in the study as to whether COS should be developed inter-
nationally or not.
Both published and ongoing developers talked about
the challenges of undertaking COS development inter-
nationally, particularly the linguistic challenges that
global participation entailed and the need to translate
concepts
and
questionnaires.
They
spoke
of
the
logistical and resource challenges of organising an
international meeting, and the challenge of getting
the balance between what is ideal and what is prag-
matic. International ethical approval procedures were
described
as
resource
intensive
and
‘bureaucratic
hurdles’.
Considerations about efficiency and heterogeneity
arise with global development, as well as generalis-
ability. However, heterogeneity can be as great within
countries as between so this should not serve as a
barrier to internationally developed COS. In a letter
to an editor in reference to the international HOME
COS for eczema, it was pointed out that for a disease
with global impact there was limited representation of
non-western participants from countries where the
societal burden of the disease is high [164]. If a COS
is developed to have international applicability then
there is an issue of inclusivity that needs to be ad-
dressed. The question of international representation
in COS development is one that requires further
research.
For practical and resource reasons, such as those de-
scribed, stakeholders from a limited number of geo-
graphical
areas
may
have
been
involved
in
the
development of a COS. Consideration should be given
to the generalisability of the results and the need for any
further research involving additional stakeholders if the
COS is to be used in settings other than the one in
which it was developed.
2.13 Study team and study committees
There are a number of study committees, described
below, that can be helpful in the development of a COS.
2.13.1 Study Management Group
The Study Management Group (SMG) is responsible for
the day-to-day management of the study and should
meet regularly (usually monthly but frequency may vary
depending on study activities).
The SMG should represent a multidisciplinary skill set
relevant to the study. For example:
� A clinical lead in the area covered by the COS
� A study coordinator with understanding, and ideally
experience of systematic review and/or outcomes
and/or Delphi studies
� A qualitative researcher – if undertaking qualitative
components of the study and not covered by the
experience of the study coordinator
� PPI research partners – ideally a minimum of two to
provide support and cross cover
� Other clinical or methodological experts depending
on the individual needs of the study

 2.13.2 Study Advisory Group (SAG)
Where a COS is developed for a condition involving a
large multidisciplinary health care team, representation
of all disciplines on the SMG could make that group un-
manageable. Instead a SAG could provide additional ex-
pertise for each discipline.
The timing and frequency of SAG meetings should be
considered based on planned study activities. Generally,
the SAG would meet less frequently than the SMG with
meetings scheduled at critical points in the study that re-
quire multidisciplinary input. Such tasks may include re-
view of the categorisation and description of outcomes,
decisions regarding the structure and content of the list of
items to be considered in a consensus process, and review
of the final report following the consensus meeting.
2.13.3 Costing the project
There are a number of cost areas to consider. The list
below describes some of the key costs but this is not ex-
haustive and each study will have particular consider-
ations. The costs of a study will likely vary over the
study duration, and a study GANTT chart that maps out
when key activities will take place is a useful tool to help
estimate the resources needed at each stage of the study.
2.13.3.1 Staff The staff working on a study will vary de-
pending on study complexity and should be considered on
a case-by-case basis. Staff involvement may also vary over
the duration of the time depending on planned activities.
Staff roles to consider:
� Co-applicants/members of the Study Management
Group – who are the co-applicants of the study,
what role will each have and how much time will
they need to fulfil that role including contributions
to the final report and study dissemination?
� Statistical support – consider statistical support for
study design, analysis and reporting
� Information systems – will a study database or
bespoke software be required? If so include time for
an information systems developer to provide these
resources
� Data management – consider any data management
requirements of the study. For example, if using
paper-based questionnaires, who will enter responses
into the study database and who will populate and
distribute follow-up questionnaires, if appropriate?
� Study coordination – the amount of coordination
will depend on the activities of an individual study.
Generally, study coordination time to schedule study
meetings, distribute and follow-up survey responses
and to schedule and prepare documentation for
focus groups, consensus meetings, etc. should be
considered. The coordinator may also take
responsibility for systematic reviews and other meth-
odological areas of the study depending on experi-
ence, financial management and communication
with the funder, ethical or governance approvals
needed for the study, monitoring of participant con-
sent, etc. and preparation of the final study report
� Qualitative research – consider any qualitative
aspects of the study and include time for data
collection, analysis and write up
2.13.3.2 Software The software chosen will depend on
the needs of the study. Basic online survey software may
be available at an institution level or might require an
annual licence to be purchased
If in-house software is being developed then the time re-
quired by information systems developers, together with
the cost of server space, should be considered (see ‘Staff’)
Delivering a Delphi survey on-line may benefit from a
bespoke system that allows automated reminders and
feedback of results. The cost of developing a bespoke
system should be considered against the staff costs where
manual population of data for each round and reminders
are needed.
2.13.3.3 Websites If the study and/or survey will be
hosted on a study-specific website then the cost of do-
main name registration and annual server hosting costs
should be included. These costs are usually on an annual
basis and cannot be included pro-rata (particularly do-
main name registration).
2.13.3.4 Printing In some circumstances information
may need to be provided in hard copy. Examples include
Participant Information Sheets, Consent Forms, postal
surveys or Delphi questionnaires, study summaries, etc.
If only a small number of participants are expected then
costs might be included in a general consumables
budget. However, where large numbers are needed these
should be included separately. Where printing costs are
included separately these should include an initial print
run plus at least one amendment of materials.
2.13.3.5 Meetings Meetings should be included where
the meeting incurs costs. Face-to-face meetings should
consider the cost of meeting rooms, refreshments and
travel. Teleconference costs should consider the number
of lines needed and the location of those joining (na-
tional or international). University or hospital telecoms
may be able to provide teleconferencing facilities and
pricing structures.
Types of meetings to consider are:
� Study Management Group and Study Advisory
Group (SAG) meetings (viii) – consider frequency,
The Author(s) Trials 2017, 18(Suppl 3):280
Page 33 of 50
 whether the meeting is face to face requiring travel
costs or by teleconference only. Take into account
the location of participants, local, national,
international
� Consensus meetings – you may need to include the
cost of venue hire and subsistence; some locations
will provide a per person cost that includes all
facilities and subsistence. The location of the
meeting and subsequent travel costs for participants
should be included. If national and/or international
participants are attending a location close to a main
train station or airport would be most appropriate
and the cost of venue hire can be considered against
additional travel costs for attending an institutional
venue
� Focus groups – take into account who the
participants are. If health care professionals then
consider where the meeting will take place, travel
costs and subsistence. Focus groups for patients/
parents should also include travel and subsistence
for each person. Focus groups for patients/parents
might take place in an alternative setting that also
acts as an incentive for attendance. For example,
holding the session at a zoo or an aquarium which
allows participants to access the attraction free of
charge after the meeting. Childcare/carer needs
should be included for patient (see ‘PPI’ section
below for cost calculator)
2.13.3.6 Travel Travel for meetings has already been de-
scribed. Applicants applying for funding should review their
institutional policies on travel; these may include the pur-
chase of standard class fares only and a limit on the mileage
that can be incurred for a single trip without justification.
2.13.3.7 Transcription Transcription costs for inter-
views, recorded meetings or focus groups may need to be
included. Each institution will have a list of approved sup-
pliers and quotations should be sought prior to applying
for funding. Prices are usually provided per minute and
will increase where there are multiple speakers who need
to be identified in the transcript.
2.13.3.8 Translation Translation costs should be in-
cluded for each language appropriate to the trial. Transla-
tion would usually include forward and back translation of
documents to ensure consistency between languages.
Again institutions will usually have a list of approved
translation services who can be approached to provide a
cost per document.
2.13.3.9 Patient and Public Involvement (PPI) in the
design and conduct of a study In some countries, e.g.
UK, payments are offered to public research partners for
the time involved in undertaking their PPI activities. The
acceptability of and approaches to payment for PPI may
differ by country, hence advice should be sought locally.
If patients are paid for PPI activities, researchers need to
ensure that patients are aware of any implications of be-
ing paid for involvement, e.g. impact on any benefits that
they are entitled to or tax implications.
Costings should be estimated for each type of involve-
ment. For example:
� PPI membership of study committees/groups
� PPI co-applicants
� Other PPI activities. Examples include parent/
patient facilitators of workshops or consensus
meetings
� Training – consider whether PPI contributors
require any training and who will provide this. This
could include attendance at conferences, external
training events or internal training. The time to
attend the training together with travel, subsistence
and childcare/carer costs should be included
� Childcare/carer time
Advice on costs for PPI in the UK is available via the IN-
VOLVE website [165]. This site also includes resources for
estimating PPI costs [166].
2.13.3.10 Equipment Software and equipment is avail-
able to allow anonymous voting at face-to-face meetings.
It might be possible to borrow this from an institution
or it may need to be purchased.
If focus groups or consensus meetings need to be re-
corded then you may need to consider purchasing equip-
ment to do this or to employ external companies with
professional equipment, particularly if it is a large group.
Also consider laptops/PCs that are needed for study
staff, particularly full-time members of staff employed
specifically for the study.
2.13.3.11 Incentives You may like to offer an incentive
to study participants; this might be acknowledgment in
the publications, a gift voucher for completing an inter-
view or joining a focus group or a prize draw for those
completing a survey. Examples of funded incentives
include an entry into a prize draw for an iPad mini
for those completing an online Delphi survey (one
iPad mini for each stakeholder group, i.e. health care
professionals and parents), a £20 gift voucher for par-
ents attending a focus group, a £10 gift voucher for
parents completing a qualitative interview [55].
2.13.3.12 Systematic review If completing a systematic
review as part of the study, costs, excluding staff costs,
The Author(s) Trials 2017, 18(Suppl 3):280
Page 34 of 50
 may include printing and costs for unsubscribed jour-
nals. Each institution should be able to provide a cost
for an interlibrary loan and an estimated number of
these included based on the estimated size of the aca-
demic literature, e.g. estimate approximately 10% of in-
cluded papers.
2.13.3.13 Publication Costs to publish the protocol and
the final manuscript should be included, based on the
current costs for the desired journal.
2.14 Reporting guidance
COS developers should provide a clear and transparent
report of the methods they used. Reporting standards
for a Delphi survey component of a COS study have
been proposed previously by some authors of this Hand-
book [138]. A more general checklist of items to be re-
ported for a COS study was then published [21].
The first comprehensive systematic review of COS
highlighted the need for a more formal reporting guide-
line for COS development studies due to the amount of
relevant information that is missing from journal articles
[14]. A guideline for reporting COS studies has recently
been developed [134].
2.15 Quality assessment/critical appraisal
It has previously been suggested that the potential im-
pact of the following methodological decisions on the
final results should be considered [21]: group compos-
ition, questioning technique, the information partici-
pants receive to inform their answers, whether or not
responses are anonymous, how the group participants
interacted with, or influenced, each other, the medium
of the interaction, attrition bias, analysis which can miss
or overstate the importance of certain outcomes, and
the way in which consensus is reached.
However the definition of quality is a difficult one,
and an area for further research may be to achieve
consensus regarding minimum standards, as discussed
in Chapter 4.
Chapter 3: Implementation, review and feedback
3.1 Background
Those developing a core outcome set (COS) need to give
careful consideration to how it will be used. This will
help to ensure that the COS contributes to the reduction
of research waste, without the COS development itself
being wasteful [167]. Those developing the COS might
prepare an implementation plan as part of the develop-
ment process which might include both the intended
audience and users of the COS and the pathways to
reach them. In this chapter, we consider efforts to facili-
tate the implementation of COS, including what poten-
tial users might consider when deciding whether a COS
is appropriate for their purposes. We also note how re-
search might be embedded into the implementation ac-
tivities to help build the evidence base for this important
aspect of COS development, bearing in mind that COS
development is still in its relative infancy and implemen-
tation strategies have not been a prominent feature in
their development to date. The chapter also considers
how COS might be kept under review, to help with deci-
sions about revising them.
The first section of the chapter describes examples of
existing research on the uptake of COS, highlighting
how the rarity of such studies means that there are many
uncertainties about the impact of the hundreds of COS
that have been developed to date and about the most ap-
propriate methods for the implementation of COS. This
is followed by a discussion of the role of various actors
in the implementation of COS, including the COMET
Initiative, COS developers, researchers, such as trialists
and systematic reviewers, funding bodies and journal ed-
itors. We then move on to discuss the importance of
keeping COS under review to ensure that COS remain
valid and up-to-date; before concluding with suggestions
for future research into the uptake, implementation and
maintenance of COS.
3.2 Existing research on the uptake of core outcome sets
The rarity of research into the uptake of COS is not sur-
prising given the relatively small number of COS. For
comparison, researchers into the impact of randomised
trials would be able to draw on several hundred thou-
sand trials and those investigating the impact of system-
atic reviews have many tens of thousands of examples of
this type of research as their starting point [168]. In con-
trast, fewer than 200 COS have been in the public do-
main for more than 5 years [14, 39], and there is likely
to be a lag between publication of a COS and its appear-
ance in trial registries, trial reports and systematic re-
views due to the time needed to design a trial, obtain
funding, and subsequently deliver and report the study.
In this section, we outline three studies that have evalu-
ated the uptake of a specific COS or a list of standard out-
come measures, and, later, we conclude this chapter with
suggestions for how this evidence base might be strength-
ened. The two studies that have assessed the uptake of a
COS focussed on the field of rheumatology [169, 170],
whilst the study of standard measures is from maternity
care [171].
The first study evaluated uptake of the World Health
Organisation/International League of Associations for
Rheumatology core set of endpoints for use in rando-
mised trials of treatments for rheumatoid arthritis [169].
This COS was established in 1994 following the 1992
OMERACT
(Outcome
Measures
in
Rheumatology)
The Author(s) Trials 2017, 18(Suppl 3):280
Page 35 of 50
 conference and consisted of seven measures (pain, pa-
tient
global
assessment,
physical
disability,
swollen
joints, tender joints, acute phase reactants and physician
global assessment) and one additional measure (radio-
graphs of joints) for studies lasting more than 1 year.
The study explored trends in the choice of outcomes
that were reported in rheumatoid arthritis trials over
two decades and also aimed to identify reasons that the
COS was not implemented in trials that did not measure
the full COS after it had been published. The sample of
350 randomised trials was identified from those included
in 48 Cochrane reviews of rheumatoid arthritis. The re-
port for each of these trials was read to ascertain
whether or not the items in the COS had been measured
or reported. If the trial had not measured all the out-
comes in the COS, the correspondence author was
emailed to determine their awareness of the COS and
their reasons for not adopting it in their randomised
trial. Identifying whether or not the RA COS was mea-
sured in the cohort of RA trials was a straightforward
process, mostly requiring only a review of the ‘outcome
assessment’ paragraph of the ‘Methods’ section of a trial
report, but time-consuming since reports needed to be
obtained.
There was an increase in the proportion of rando-
mised trials measuring the COS items over time, with al-
most 70% measuring all these outcomes in trials that
were published at the end of the first decade of the
twentieth century. Of the trialists who did not measure
the full COS, the survey revealed that most were un-
aware of the COS when selecting outcomes to measure.
Amongst those who were aware of the COS, two did not
measure all of the outcomes because their trials focussed
mainly on safety, one did measure all outcomes but
failed to report one of them and one had already se-
lected the outcomes for their trial before the COS was
published.
The second study to assess COS uptake considered the
ASAS (Assessment of SpondyloArthritis International So-
ciety)/OMERACT axial spondyloarthritis (AS) COS for
disease-controlling anti-rheumatic therapy (DC-ART) and
symptom-modifying
anti-rheumatic
drugs
(SMARDs)
[170]. Both COS include physical function, pain, spinal
mobility, spinal stiffness, fatigue and patient global as-
sessment. In
addition,
the
DC-ART COS
includes
peripheral joints/entheses, acute phase reactants and
radiographs of the spine. The study assessed uptake
of the outcomes from these two COS in randomised
trials of pharmacological and non-pharmacological in-
terventions in AS.
A total of 99 randomised trials were identified by a sys-
tematic review and separated into those reported in the
first 2 years after publication of the COS (n = 48) and
those reported at least 2 years after the COS (n = 51). The
study found that some of the AS COS outcomes were
more frequently measured in the second group of rando-
mised trials. These included physical function, peripheral
joints/entheses and fatigue in the DC-ART COS and
physical function and fatigue in the SMARD COS.
However, there was a decrease in the frequency for
one of the SMARD COS outcomes: patient global as-
sessment. Overall, 20% of randomised trials published
at least 2 years after the COS measured all outcomes
included in the COS.
Finally, the third study looked at gestational dia-
betes mellitus (GDM) research to assess the uptake of
‘standard outcomes’ that had been developed by the
WOMBAT (WOMen and Babies health and wellbeing:
Action through Trials) Collaboration [171]. The study
surveyed Cochrane protocols and reviews that exam-
ined interventions for GDM before and after the
‘standard outcomes’ were made available by WOM-
BAT in 2009. Four protocols and 13 reviews (includ-
ing 49 trials, published from 1983 to 2012) were
included. One protocol and five reviews were pub-
lished during 2001–2009 and three protocols and
eight
reviews
were
published
during
2010–2014.
These covered prevention (5 protocols/reviews), de-
tection (2), management (8) and follow-up (2). There
was reasonable consistency between the protocols and
reviews from before and after 2009, with a mean of
four prespecified primary outcomes, covering 12 dif-
ferent maternal outcomes and nine different child
outcomes. The most common primary outcomes for
mothers were GDM and caesarean birth. The most
common outcomes for their children were perinatal
mortality, large-for-gestational age and macrosomia.
The number of prespecified secondary outcomes was
higher after WOMBAT’s ‘standard outcomes’ were
made available (means of 26 and 48 in 2001–2009
and 2010–2014, respectively). There was an increase
in the number of outcomes that were prespecified by
at least half of the protocols and reviews, with this
being particularly true for those related to longer-
term follow-up.
3.3 Implementation
Although there is a paucity of research into the uptake
of COS, it is clear that there is still room for improve-
ment in their uptake and implementation. Several differ-
ent actors have a role in this and are already seeking to
improve matters.
3.3.1 Role of the COMET Initiative
The COMET Initiative is facilitating the uptake and im-
plementation of COS [21], and seeking to avoid the
waste that might be generated by unnecessary duplica-
tion and a proliferation of COS, by:
The Author(s) Trials 2017, 18(Suppl 3):280
Page 36 of 50
 1. Making it easier for COS developers and potential
users to find COS through the free availability of
summaries of ongoing and completed COS in the
COMET database [22, 38]
2. Highlighting new COS in a news feed on the
COMET website
3. Encouraging COS developers to produce an
implementation plan from the start, including
consideration of any potential barriers and cost
implications
4. Working with organisations that cover multiple
areas of health and social care, including academic
initiatives such as Cochrane, SPIRIT (Standard
Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional
Trials), GRADE (Grading of Recommendations
Assessment, Development and Evaluation) Working
Group and researchers involved in the development
of COS; as well as potential funders of COS
development and of research more generally,
industry, health care regulators, developers of
guidelines and journals
The first two of these activities are covered in Chapter
2 about the COMET database, and the present chapter
includes a section highlighting issues that COS devel-
opers might consider when developing an implementa-
tion plan (see below). Some examples of the work of the
COMET Initiative towards the fourth are outlined here.
3.3.2 Role of core outcome set developers
Little is known about how COS developers perceive
their role in implementation. In a recent survey, re-
searchers who had published COS were asked ‘Was the
future implementation or uptake of the core outcome
set considered by your group at any stage?’ [65]. Of 76
responders, 12 (16%) had not, indicating either that they
saw implementation as beyond the scope of COS devel-
opment, or that funding was not available to support the
implementation work. Those developers who had con-
sidered this task listed the following as implementation
activities: publication in a journal (n = 18), participation
in meetings (n = 11), talking to relevant stakeholder
groups (n = 7), the involvement of prospective users in
the development process who might influence uptake
later on (n = 5), uptake in guidelines (n = 3).Those devel-
opers who had considered this task seemed to focus
their answers more on dissemination than implementa-
tion, reflecting the conflation of these two different
topics which also appears elsewhere in health research.
For instance, 18 responders listed publication in a jour-
nal (n = 18). Some reported a more proactive role in try-
ing to get their COS implemented beyond their own
research team; and although it remains unclear whether
some
of
these
activities
should
be
categorised
as
dissemination or attempts to ensure implementation, they
included participation in meetings (n = 11), talking to rele-
vant stakeholder groups (n = 7), involving prospective
users in the development process who might influence up-
take later on (n = 5), and uptake in guidelines (n = 3).
3.3.2.1 Stakeholders as future implementers As well
as developing an implementation plan for what they
would like to happen with their COS (see below), COS
developers
should
consider
how
the
development
process itself might help with the subsequent implemen-
tation of the COS. For example, the international nature
of the stakeholders who are involved in its development
and the various groups and disciplines that are brought
together may have an impact on the perceived relevance
of the COS to countries and groups that are represented,
or are not represented.
Furthermore, the actual involvement of individuals in
the development may influence their subsequent uptake
of the COS, as has been shown previously with the results
of clinical trials [172]. This is being examined in a rando-
mised trial and observational cohort study embedded
within the development of a COS for studies of mechan-
ical ventilation in critical care. COVenT (Core Outcomes
in Ventilation Trials) includes a prospective observational
cohort study to determine if participation of trial investi-
gators in the Delphi panel for the COS increases subse-
quent COS uptake, on the basis of the use of the COS in
published reports of clinical trials in the decade after the
COS is published. Authors of studies of mechanical venti-
lation were identified from extensive literature searches
and were randomised to either participate in the Delphi
panel as a ‘trial investigator’ stakeholder representative or
not to participate. Five and 10 years after their COS is
published, the COS developers will examine the publica-
tions of all these researchers to compare the use of the
COS between the two groups [132].
3.3.2.2 Development of an implementation plan The
implementation plan for a COS should reflect the par-
ticular circumstances of the COS and the area of health
or social care for which it was developed. It might be
that the COS was developed with a particular focus on
helping with the design of a new randomised trial [173],
but more generally, it is likely that the COS was devel-
oped with the intention of improving research more
widely. With this in mind, COS developers could con-
sider the following elements for their implementation
plan:
1. Register the intention to do the COS with the
COMET Initiative, include an entry for it in the
publically accessible database when work begins and
The Author(s) Trials 2017, 18(Suppl 3):280
Page 37 of 50
 ensure that the final COS is linked to from the
database
2. Disseminate the COS to researchers in the area of
health or social care, through publication in an
appropriate journal and presentation at relevant
conferences
3. Contact funders of research in the area of health or
social care, relevant Cochrane Review Groups,
guideline producers, regulators and relevant
commercial organisations to let them know about
the COS
4. Inform those responsible for planned and ongoing
research identified through prospective registries,
including trial registries such as those accessible
through the WHO portal for international clinical
trial registries [174] and PROSPERO for systematic
reviews [175]
5. Contact journals in the area of health or social care
to suggest an editorial or commentary about the
COS
3.3.3 Role of trialists
As part of the planning for their trial, researchers who
wish to maximise the potential impact of their findings
need to ensure that they will measure outcomes that will
make it easier to show the relevance of those findings.
They can do this by determining whether or not a COS
exists and then considering whether it might form the
basis for the outcomes to measure in their trial. This
would not restrict them to the COS alone, but provides
them with the minimum to include. They remain able to
include additional outcomes, especially those that might
be particularly pertinent to their study. This is noted in
the SPIRIT (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations
for Interventional Trials) guidance on the reporting of
protocols for clinical trials, which recommends ‘where
possible, the development and adoption of a common
set of key trial outcomes within a specialty can help to
deter selective reporting of outcomes and to facilitate
comparisons and pooling of results across trials in a
meta-analysis. The COMET (Core Outcome Measures
in Effectiveness Trials) Initiative aims to facilitate the de-
velopment and application of such standardised sets of
core outcomes for clinical trials of specific conditions
[34]. Trial investigators are encouraged to ascertain
whether there is a COS relevant to their trial and, if so,
to include those outcomes in their trial. Existence of a
common set of outcomes does not preclude inclusion of
additional relevant outcomes for a given trial’ [176].
In deciding on the relevance of a COS to their trial, re-
searchers should consider its scope, defined in terms of
the health condition, target population and whether it is
for any intervention or specific types of intervention.
These
cover
the
first
three
elements
of
a
PICO
(Population,
Intervention,
Comparator,
Outcomes)
structured question for a clinical trial, and it may be that
an existing COS helps a trialist to decide on the out-
comes to measure based on a partial overlap between
some of these elements in a COS and those for their
trial. Once again, the availability of hundreds of COS in
the COMET database makes it much easier for re-
searchers to identify all the COS that might be useful to
them, without the need to do their own extensive
searches of the academic literature [177].
3.3.4 Engagement with funders
The importance of COS is increasingly being recognised
by research funders. For example, the National Institute
for Health Research (NIHR) in the UK, the Health Re-
search Board in Ireland and the charity Arthritis Re-
search UK, all highlight COMET to researchers seeking
funding for new trials and studies. In the UK, the NIHR
Health
Technology
Assessment
(NIHR
HTA)
Programme includes the following text in their Guid-
ance Notes for Completing Full Proposals: ‘Details should
include justification of the use of outcome measures
where a legitimate choice exists between alternatives.
Where established Core Outcomes exist they should be
included amongst the list of outcomes unless there is
good reason to do otherwise. Please see The COMET
Initiative website [34] to identify whether Core Out-
comes have been established’.
3.3.5 Engagement with prospective research registries
The benefits of prospective registration of research are
now widely recognised and accepted [174]. The registra-
tion process provides an opportunity to encourage re-
searchers to consider the use of a COS at early stages in
the planning of their study. For example, in planning
their trial and preparing their entry for the trial registry,
researchers should identify whether a relevant COS
already exists and, if so, they should be explicit about
whether or not they will use it. If they will use it, they
should cite the COS and specify each of the outcomes in
the COS and any additional outcomes that they intend
to measure [178]. By listing the COS outcomes, the re-
searcher will make it easier for users of the registry to
see what they will measure and to find their entry if they
search on outcomes. One way to make this easier to
achieve would be for the trial registry to link to registries
of COS that would allow the entry for a trial to be popu-
lated automatically with the COS outcomes (which
might then be edited by the researcher, if necessary). If a
researcher finds and considers a relevant COS when de-
signing and registering their trial, this might also help
them in choosing and justifying their primary outcomes
[179]. Primary outcomes are likely to be used in calculat-
ing the sample size for the trial, and should also be those
The Author(s) Trials 2017, 18(Suppl 3):280
Page 38 of 50
 that are given the highest priority for measurement and
reporting by the researcher, with particular efforts to min-
imise missing data. When a trial has closed, the registry
entry remains important for those who wish to use the
trial in decision-making because it can help them to de-
cide if any reports of the trial are subject to selective
reporting of outcomes. If the outcomes in a COS were
listed in the registry entry, systematic reviewers and others
who wish to use the trial’s findings should find it easier to
assess the risk of selective reporting bias.
Similarly, systematic reviewers might themselves make
more use of COS, and be clear about doing so. They
should consider whether to use a COS when choosing
the outcomes to use to test the effects of the interven-
tions that they will investigate in their review [180]. As
with trials, this use of a COS should be clear in the
protocol for the review and in its entry in a prospective
registry. Cochrane, as the world’s largest producer of sys-
tematic reviews has, since its inception in the 1990s, re-
quired those preparing Cochrane reviews to register
their proposed review with the relevant Cochrane Re-
view Group before preparing the protocol for their re-
view
which
would
be
published
in
the
Cochrane
Database of Systematic Reviews following editorial ap-
proval. This process relates only to Cochrane reviews
but, since 2011, all systematic reviewers in health care
have been able to prospectively register their review in
the free-to-use, publically available registry for system-
atic reviews, PROSPERO. This was developed by the
Centre for Reviews and Dissemination in the University
of York, UK [175] and, as of 2017, contains more than
20,000 entries for systematic reviews. The researchers
are able to list the outcomes that they wish to use in the
review and, as with trialists, they could include the COS,
the specific outcomes within this and any additional out-
comes that they are interested in. Just as a COS might
help a trialist to choose their primary outcomes, re-
viewers might find that a COS helps them to choose the
outcomes to include in a Summary of Findings (SoF)
table (as noted above) [179] and to focus their efforts on
obtaining data for these outcomes, even if the data are
not readily available in the reports of eligible studies.
Similarly, the explicit use of a COS in the entry for a re-
view will help users to decide if the review is affected by
selective reporting bias if all the outcomes from the
COS are now tackled in the review’s results [181].
3.3.6 Engagement with journals
COS have been published in a range of journals over the
last two decades [14, 39, 177] and some journals now
publish the protocols for the development of COS. This
will help to raise awareness of COS and, coupled with
the COMET database, will improve access to them.
However, as with the uptake of guidelines for the
reporting of different types of research study, such as
CONSORT for randomised trials [182] and PRISMA-
IPD for the reporting of meta-analyses that used individ-
ual participant data [183], the next step will be the active
encouragement by journals of the use of COS in re-
search studies. An important recent development along
these lines is the CROWN (Core Outcomes in Women’s
Health) Initiative. This is a consortium of over 78 obstet-
rics and gynaecology (and related) journal editors which
will ‘strongly encourage the reporting of results for COS.
Facilitate embedding of COS in research practice, work-
ing closely with researchers, reviewers, funders and
guideline-makers’ [184].
3.3.7 Role of systematic reviewers
Systematic reviewers are often the researchers who
struggle most because of inconsistencies in the outcomes
that have been measured and reported in trials of health
and social care. This hampers their ability to bring to-
gether the evidence from research that already exists,
and to compare, contrast and combine it to resolve the
uncertainties that they are addressing in their review.
Alongside key stakeholders, such as practitioners, pa-
tients and others users of health and social care services,
researchers, policy-makers and those who fund services
and research, there is an important role for systematic
reviewers in the development of COS. Their involvement
may help to overcome some of the problems encoun-
tered by reviewers when trying to select outcomes for
their review and by users when reading reviews.
Currently, the explicit use of COS in systematic re-
views seems rare. The aforementioned study of Bain et
al. assessed the use of the WOMBAT standard measures
in Cochrane protocols and reviews for gestational mater-
nal diabetes [171] and fuller surveys of all Cochrane re-
views that were first published in 2007 (387 reviews),
2011 (401) and 2013 (439) investigated the choice of
outcomes more generally [101, 185]. This research found
that none of these 1227 reviews cited a COS when dis-
cussing the choice of outcomes investigated in the re-
view. The reviews included a total of nearly 9800
outcomes, with the most recent sample (reviews pub-
lished for the first time in 2013) ranging from three re-
views that assessed just one outcome measure to a
review with 62 outcome measures. The median number
of outcomes was seven. As noted above, COS might be
particularly useful for Cochrane reviews during the se-
lection of outcomes to include in the SoF developed by
the GRADE Working Group to summarise the results
for important outcomes and the quality of this evidence.
These tables were introduced to Cochrane reviews in
2008, and were included in 112 (31%) of the 361 full re-
views published for the first time in 2011 that contained
The Author(s) Trials 2017, 18(Suppl 3):280
Page 39 of 50
 at least one included study, rising to 57% (216 of 375 re-
views) in 2013 [185].
3.3.8 Engagement with Cochrane
Cochrane is the world’s largest organisation dedicated to
the preparation and maintenance of systematic reviews
in health and social care. More than 9000 protocols and
full reviews have been published in the Cochrane Library
over the last 20 years and COMET has worked with
Cochrane on a variety of projects to facilitate the uptake
of COS in these reviews. This has been done partly in
the context of the SoF tables that are now included in
many of these reviews [186]. These tables present the
results of the review for up to seven outcomes that are
deemed to be important to patients, to improve the
understanding and retrieval of the key findings of the
review.
In
2011–2012,
alongside
an
investigation
of
the
amount of missing patient data for primary outcomes in
Cochrane reviews, the coordinating editors of Cochrane
Review Groups (CRGs) were surveyed about issues re-
lated to the standardisation of outcomes in their CRGs’
reviews [16]. Almost all the coordinating editors (from
45 of the 50 CRGs surveyed) responded to this survey,
revealing that 14 coordinating editors (31%) had been in-
volved in the development of a COS and 16 (36%) were
aware of other work to develop a COS for conditions
relevant to their CRG. It also found that 16 (36%) CRGs
had a centralised policy regarding which outcomes to in-
clude in the SoF table and 33 (73%) coordinating editors
thought that a COS for effectiveness trials should be
used routinely for a SoF table. The coordinating editors
listed advantages and challenges associated with standar-
dising outcomes across reviews in their CRG, with the
most common advantage for having a COS being that
systematic reviews or meta-analyses would benefit from
the standardisation of outcomes. The main challenges
were the processes needed to develop a COS, how to de-
cide when a COS should be applied and the persuasion
of potential authors of Cochrane reviews to use the
COS. Since this survey, discussions with Cochrane have
been ongoing about the use of COS in Cochrane re-
views. In particular, as the proportion of Cochrane re-
views with a SoF table is increasing, COMET is in
discussion with those responsible for the guidance on
these (including GRADE) about emphasising the poten-
tial value of COS when selecting the up to seven out-
comes to include in one of these tables.
3.4 Review and feedback
Assessments of the uptake of COS, such as the few that
have been done to date (see above) and those that could
be done as part of a wider research agenda (see below)
can provide an opportunity to review an existing COS. If
these investigations reveal that randomised trials or sys-
tematic reviews are not measuring or assessing a par-
ticular outcome that is included in the COS, the
relevance of that outcome to the COS might be recon-
sidered. Likewise, given the recognition that trials and
reviews are likely to continue to study outcomes outside
a COS, if the research studies in a particular area of
health or social care are consistently measuring an out-
come that is not included in the COS, a revision or up-
date of the COS might be indicated.
Decisions about whether a COS is ‘fit for purpose’
might be informed by interviews with the intended users
of the COS, such as trialists, to gather their reasons for
implementing a COS or for not doing so. This can pro-
vide an understanding of the decision-making process
that they used when choosing which outcomes to meas-
ure and the value that they place on COS developed by
others. This may suggest improvements to methods of
COS development; for example, including a particular
stakeholder group that would encourage more trialists
to adopt a COS in their trials.
COS developers should consider opportunities to re-
view their COS periodically. Some groups, such as
OMERACT, already have mechanisms in place to review
their COS which have led to important changes. For ex-
ample, the development of the original OMERACT COS
in rheumatoid arthritis was done without direct patient
input; but focus groups with patients were held at the
6th OMERACT meeting in 2002 to build upon the find-
ings from a previous email survey. The survey had iden-
tified fatigue and sleep as missing from the OMERACT
COS and an analysis of the patient focus group discus-
sions strengthened further the importance of fatigue
which was then added to the COS.
Given the low proportion of existing COS that have
involved patients to date, it may be expected that a fu-
ture review of such a COS would identify patient input
to be an important gap. Where an existing COS has
been developed without the perspective of patients or
other key stakeholders, qualitative studies may help to
address this omission.
Several examples exist where periodic reviews were
planned in advance. In 1991, guidelines for controlled
trials of drugs in migraine were published [187]. These
guidelines included recommendations about the out-
comes that should be measured, and were based on the
experience of the committee members and in some
cases on analysis of previous trials. They stated that a re-
vised second edition of these guidelines was planned for
3–4 years’ time. A second edition of these guidelines
was subsequently published in 2000 [188]. They stated
that ‘The experience of clinical investigators and the
pharmaceutical industry has expanded enormously, pro-
viding a basis for revising these guidelines now’. A third
The Author(s) Trials 2017, 18(Suppl 3):280
Page 40 of 50
 edition of these guidelines was published as a ‘consensus
summary that was developed by experts in the field’.
The International Headache Society Committee on
Clinical Trials also published guidelines for trials of drug
treatments in tension-type headache [189]. They simi-
larly stated that a revised second edition of these guide-
lines was planned for 3-4 years’ time, subsequently
published in 2010 [190]. They stated that ‘Since 1995
several studies on the treatment of episodic and chronic
tension-type headaches have been published, providing
new information on trial methodology for this disorder’.
In another example, a consensus conference in ovarian
cancer involving 52 experts produced recommendations
about study methodology including outcomes for trials
[191]. It was recommended that they reconvene in 4 to
5 years to review the latest evidence from high-quality
clinical trials [192]. There was a proceeding consensus
conference, following the same methodology, which was
attended by 77 experts. They stated that ‘This confer-
ence served to further advance the knowledge provided
in earlier such conferences and to provide new parame-
ters for trial design,’ which specifically included the con-
sideration of patient-reported outcomes.
Additional work has been undertaken following the
publication of a COS for vitiligo. The original objective
was to create guidelines for randomised controlled trials
investigating interventions used in the management of
vitiligo, and the work was based on the assessment of
the methodology of RCTs included in a 2010 update of
the Cochrane systematic review ‘Interventions for Viti-
ligo’ [193]. The guideline developers included authors of
the Cochrane review (clinicians, patient representatives
and a statistician) plus the coordinator of the vitiligo
priority-setting partnership at the Centre of Evidence-
Based Dermatology at the University of Nottingham.
Subsequent work was carried out specifically around
outcomes, including a systematic review of outcomes
and a survey of patients and clinicians on outcomes in
vitiligo trials [194]. This, in combination with the ori-
ginal publication, was described as ‘a good starting point
for creating a consensus on a core outcome set for viti-
ligo trials’. A Delphi study was carried out with the aim
of developing ‘international consensus over a COS for
vitiligo trials that is acceptable to health care profes-
sionals, patients and their caregivers, researchers and
regulatory bodies’ [195]. Further work is now underway
to develop definitions of outcomes, and determine the
best way of measuring recommended outcomes.
Periodic review would allow developers to confirm the
ongoing validity of the COS, ensure that included out-
comes are still relevant and important, and that no ex-
cluded outcomes should be added. It would also allow
them to evaluate how successful implementation has
been and to engage further stakeholders as appropriate.
However, as with the updating of systematic reviews
[196], there are uncertainties about the frequency with
which this re-visiting should be done, and whether there
might be triggers to prompt it.
3.5 Future research into the uptake and implementation
of core outcome sets
We conclude this chapter with some suggestions for re-
search that could help to determine the uptake, imple-
mentation and impact of COS. This draws on the
approaches taken in the small number of existing exam-
ples of such research, as noted above, and on ideas
around assessments of knowledge transfer and research
impact more generally.
3.5.1 Clinical trials registries
As noted above, researchers are encouraged to consider
COS when registering their clinical trials or systematic
reviews [178, 180]. Registries provide public access to in-
formation on planned, ongoing and recently completed
trials and reviews. An assessment of the listed outcomes
would provide an up-to-date guide to the outcomes that
the researchers intended to measure or assess. It would
also provide a way to determine the proportion of
current trials and reviews in a particular area of health
that are using the appropriate COS.
3.5.2 Applications for funding and ethical approval
In some cases, an even earlier step than trial registration
may be the researcher’s application for funding or ethical
approval to do their study. Access to such applications
would allow an assessment of the impact of encourage-
ment to use COS by funders such as the NIHR HTA
Programme (see above), as well as the uptake of COS re-
gardless of such encouragement. Such assessments could
use methods that have been employed previously to look
at cohorts of funding applications and submissions to
ethics committees to examine, for instance, the use of
systematic reviews in the design of the proposed studies
[197–199].
3.5.3 Citation analysis and surveys of reports of trials and
reviews
Moving on to the published reports of research, at its
simplest, citation analysis involves counting the number
of citations received by a COS publication, author or re-
search team, taking account of the volume of their re-
search output [200, 201]. The assumption is that the
higher the citation count, the greater the impact of the
research, and this type of study can be relatively quick
given the existence of citation databases. However, sim-
ply counting the number of citations loses the subtlety
of the context for the citing of an article and, so, a more
The Author(s) Trials 2017, 18(Suppl 3):280
Page 41 of 50
 in-depth citation analysis would look at the citing docu-
ments to try to determine the reason for the citation
[200]. Further refinements of this type of research might
include a focus on the citations of the COS article in re-
ports of randomised trials or systematic reviews if these
were the principal targets that the COS was developed
for. Such work might also include qualitative research to
explore why trialists and reviewers did, or did not, use
the COS; akin to that done in the aforementioned study
of the uptake of the OMERACT COS [169].
More generally, assessments could be done of collec-
tions of reports of trials and reviews to see whether
these describe the use of COS and to survey the out-
comes that have been used. The latter is often a first step
in the development of a COS, providing the basis for the
list of outcomes that might be considered in the early
stages of a consensus process such as a Delphi exercise
[14]. As noted above, such assessments of impact have
been done for reports of randomised trials in relation to
the OMERACT COS [169], Cochrane protocols and re-
views of gestational maternal diabetes [171] and new
Cochrane reviews from 2007, 2011 and 2013 [101, 185].
3.6 Conclusions
The development of a COS should not be seen as an
end in itself, but rather as a means for making it easier
for researchers in a particular area of health or social
care to do better and more informative studies that will
resolve important uncertainties. Therefore, the various
actors in the development of COS and potential users
have roles to play in ensuring that the COS are consid-
ered when new research is being planned. This should
lead to greater uptake and implementation, and provide
opportunities to keep the relevance of existing COS
under review. The development of COS should also be
subject to rigorous evaluation to examine the impact of
COS, and to identify the most effective and efficient
methods for their future development and enhancement.
Chapter 4: Discussion
This Handbook describes what we currently know about
the methods for COS development, implementation, re-
view and uptake. There is no ‘gold standard’ method for
COS development. For some aspects, we have recommen-
dations for practice; for others, we have identified issues
to consider; and in other areas we have highlighted the
need for research. In this chapter, we discuss these pro-
posals for the future of COS development and uptake.
4.1 Recommendations for practice
Researchers should clearly define the scope of the COS
to be developed.
COS developers should register their project in the
COMET database.
A protocol should be developed to describe the work
that will be done to develop the COS, and made publi-
cally available.
A COS implementation plan should be considered
from the outset, including how the development process
might help to improve subsequent uptake.
COS developers should identify and take into account
relevant existing knowledge as part of the development
process. Sufficient time should be given to structuring
and wording any initial list of outcomes to be considered
in the process.
If a Delphi study is undertaken as part of the consen-
sus
process,
feedback
should
allow
all
stakeholder
groups to see the results from other stakeholder groups
separately before re-scoring. This follows evaluation in
several nested randomised studies which show that pro-
viding feedback separately by stakeholder group im-
proves the degree of consensus reached [130].
The final COS should be agreed following one or more
face-to-face meetings involving relevant stakeholders
groups, organised in order to discuss the results of prior
work, including the review of existing knowledge and
the establishment of stakeholder opinions.
The COS development study should be published fol-
lowing the COS-STAR reporting guideline.
Researchers should use the COSMIN-COMET guid-
ance to determine how to select instruments for meas-
urement of outcomes in a COS.
4.2 Recommendations for research
The credibility of a COS depends on the use of
sound methodology in its development, and, transpar-
ent reporting of the processes adopted. The imple-
mentation of the COS in clinical trials will depend on
effective dissemination and its acceptance by the re-
search community which includes researchers, pa-
tients and the public and funders. To improve the
methodology, reporting and implementation of COS,
further research is required to address the following
objectives:
1. To compare different methods used to develop COS,
with respect to minimising bias, maximising
efficiency, and increasing the degree of uptake
Interviews with COS developers revealed that they
would have appreciated methodological guidance
early on in the COS development process (Gargon
et al. 2016). Our systematic review revealed wide
variation in the methods used to develop COS. We
have identified a wide range of research that is
needed to provide a robust evidence base for the
methods associated with COS development. Work is
needed to compare existing methods in order to
The Author(s) Trials 2017, 18(Suppl 3):280
Page 42 of 50
 identify ways to minimise bias, maximise efficiency
and increase uptake, thereby reducing waste. In
order to improve the methods, we recommend that
COS developers take the opportunity of nesting
methodology research studies, whenever possible, in
their work to help resolve uncertainties and
strengthen the evidence base. This evidence base can
then be used as a basis for recommendations for
practice, as is the case with the evaluations of the
methods of feedback to different stakeholder groups,
which led to the recommendation for practice
above.
2. To understand better the patient perspective and
strengthen patient and public engagement in studies
developing COS
COS need to include those outcomes that are most
relevant to patients and carers, so it is vital that
patients and carers are involved in their
development. There are examples of where involving
patients in the process identified an outcome that
was important to them as a group and was
subsequently included in the COS, but which might
have been overlooked if the COS had been
developed by practitioners on their own.
Researchers are increasingly including patients and
the public alongside other stakeholders in identifying
what outcomes to measure in clinical trials, but
uncertainty remains about the best ways to do this.
For example, although only 22% of COS published
up to 2014 reported that there was input from
patients in their development (Gargon 2015, Gorst
2016), nearly 90% of ongoing studies include
patients as participants. The uncertainty is no longer
around whether patients should participate, but
rather the nature of that participation.
3. To develop a consensus-based guideline for the con-
tent of a COS development protocol
It is recommended that a protocol be written for COS
development studies. A guideline for the content of this
protocol, similar to the SPIRIT guidance for the
content of a clinical trial protocol [176], and developed
through a consensus process, would be helpful.
4. To develop and disseminate advice regarding issues
to consider when assessing studies developing COS
To date, there has been no formal quality
assessment of COS studies, and the COMET
database includes all those that have been identified
as meeting the eligibility criteria but without any
central assessment of quality. However, defining the
quality of a COS is not straightforward. In principle,
a ‘good’ COS is one that is implemented and leads
to improved outcomes for patients but this might be
far down-stream of the development process. Work
is needed to assess the implications of the different
methods of COS development for both minimising
bias, maximising efficiency, and increasing uptake on
the likelihood that the COS will have this positive
impact.
Even if robust methods are identified for developing
COS, whether these methods were followed might
not be easily assessed from a report of that process.
However, the report might allow the potential user
of the COS to consider how the developers
minimised biases that can occur in the process,
particularly if the COS-STAR reporting guideline is
followed. There is a pressing need to assess how a
COS has been developed using internationally recog-
nised minimum standards that are valid and reliable
and need to be agreed. This is particularly important
for the research community who are considering
whether or not to use a COS, in order to allow them
to decide whether an existing COS is good enough
to be adopted. In some cases, they might need to de-
cide between different COS that may be relevant to
their specific research study. This research to iden-
tify the key elements in the COS development and
reporting process would feed into the future review
of the COS-STAR reporting guideline.
5. To compare different methods for disseminating,
improving access to, and promoting the use of, COS
on their uptake in trials and reviews
Previous research has identified perceived challenges
to the widespread implementation of COS [16].
These include slow or limited uptake, multiple
groups developing COS for the same topic and
inconsistencies between these COS, accessibility of
relevant COS to all stakeholders, and the need to
update COS over time. Several methods have
been suggested to improve the uptake of COS,
including improved dissemination and accessibility
(such as through the COMET database and better
indexing of reports of COS), pressure from
funders in the drive to reduce waste in research
[202], and advocacy by patients and the public.
Future developers and funders of COS would
benefit from evidence on the effectiveness of
different strategies and how best to
implement these.
6. To identify best methods for disseminating COS to
patient participants and the wider patient
community
It is good practice to share the results from the COS
study with everyone involved in decisions about
health and social care, including patients. There are
few examples of this, however, which is likely to
reflect the limited involvement of patients to date in
this area of research. Examples of involving public
research partners in writing the end-of-study
The Author(s) Trials 2017, 18(Suppl 3):280
Page 43 of 50
 information, are beginning to emerge [79] but more
work is needed to understand optimal forms of com-
munication and dissemination in particular settings.
7. To examine the level of uptake of existing COS and
understand the reasons why researchers (including
trialists and systematic reviewers) do, and do
not, use them
Although a small number of studies have directly
assessed the impact of individual COS on clinical trial
design [169, 170], more research is needed to
investigate whether, or how, COS might make a
difference to trials and reviews. It is timely to examine
the level of uptake of a wider range of existing COS
and to understand the reasons why researchers
working on trials and reviews do (and do not) include
the recommended outcomes in their studies.
For example, our survey of more than 1000 new
Cochrane reviews from 2007, 2011 and 2013 found
that none of these made explicit reference to a COS
in their design or results. Research is needed to
understand the attitude of researchers to the use of
COS in systematic reviews, to identify barriers and
facilitators, and to repeat and extend the survey to
assess uptake in this community.
Research into the uptake of COS should make use of
existing knowledge from the field of implementation
science to understand how to effect professional
behaviour change in this context. Awareness of
COS and COMET is growing through advocacy,
with a recommendation to use a relevant COS
being made in guidance for trialists [176],
applicants for grant funding (for example, NIHR,
see ‘Implementation’ in Chapter 3 above’),
applicants for regulatory approval [203], clinical
guideline developers
(Chapter 4.3 in [204]).
Reviewing lessons learnt from experience of other
initiatives providing guidance to trialists will be
useful. For example, CONSORT is very widely
known, and whilst some aspects, such as the
inclusion of the flow diagram, have had a major
impact [205], overall adherence remains
disappointingly poor [206]. This shows that whilst it
is possible to achieve change, it is difficult and
certainly slow. The analogy with CONSORT is not
exact however. COMET addresses study design and
so there is potential for influence at the initiation of
research including the funding stage. CONSORT, by
contrast, whilst relevant to consider at the design
stage is primarily relevant after the research is
completed and is being written up. This may be an
important difference.
8. To understand better the role and contribution of
qualitative research in COS development
The use of qualitative research in COS development
is an evolving area and there is only limited
experience of qualitative research in this context.
There are several areas where methodological work
around qualitative research in the context of COS
development would be helpful, including:
� Use of existing qualitative research and secondary
analysis of qualitative data as part of the
foundations for the COS development
� Use of qualitative research at different stages of
COS development, including to update existing
COS
� Methods of qualitative data collection and of
eliciting stakeholder perspectives on outcomes
� Impact of qualitative research on stakeholder
participation in subsequent processes
� Impact of qualitative research on user confidence
in COS
4.3 Other applications for core outcome sets
4.3.1 Core Information Sets
Patients require information in order to participate in
decision-making and provide their consent to treat-
ment. The amount of information that could be com-
municated
is
large
and
it
is
often
unclear
what
information is most important for achieving under-
standing of treatments and their consequences. There
is a danger of overwhelming patients with data and
technical
detail
which
may
hamper
their
unders-
tanding and increase anxiety. Furthermore, clinicians
may vary the information provided, thus reducing
consistency of practice. The importance of this issue
has been highlighted in a recent landmark ruling by
the UK Supreme Court. Now, the law is aligned more
closely with professional standards that require clini-
cians to spend time with patients discussing the risks,
intended benefits, and reasonable alternative options
before seeking consent to proceed. Within a process
of shared decision-making it is expected that the
physician and patient agree together on an appropri-
ate treatment plan that fits the patient’s values and
situation. The physician is responsible for finding out
what risks associated with the treatment matter to a
reasonable person in the patient’s position or would
probably matter to the individual patient [207]. One
new and developing method for physician to use in
clinical consultations is to identify ‘core information’.
This
includes
information
of
importance
(that
is
valued) by patients within a ‘core information (dis-
closure) set’ [208]. Core information represents the
minimum information to be discussed in all consulta-
tions for a particular intervention. The idea of core
information was described over 30 years ago when
‘core
disclosure’
was
recommended
[209].
It
was
The Author(s) Trials 2017, 18(Suppl 3):280
Page 44 of 50
 suggested that a core disclosure set would include in-
formation of importance to key stakeholders (patients
and clinicians), be feasible to communicate in a regular
clinical consultation, and act as a stimulus for further dis-
cussion of importance to the patient. Although a seminal
idea, it has received little attention or application
until recently when clinicians involved in the COMET
Initiative have adapted core outcomes methodology to
develop Core Information Sets [210]. Core Informa-
tion Sets for surgery for oesophageal [58] and colo-
rectal cancer have been developed and more recently
for head and neck cancer. More work is still needed
to establish how Core Information Sets are optimally
used in clinical consultations and which outcomes
best assess their effectiveness at improving informed
consent.
4.3.2 Core outcome sets in routine care
The International Consortium for Health Outcomes
Measurement
(ICHOM)
organises
global
teams
of
physician leaders, outcomes researchers and patient
advocates to define core sets of outcomes per medical
condition for use in clinical practice rather than clin-
ical trials. Health care is complex and medical know-
ledge is changing fast. Reliable outcome data enable
physicians
and
patients
to
make
better
decisions
about what treatments are best for them and who
should provide them. ICHOM is a relatively new ini-
tiative, aiming to publish 50 standard sets by 2017. A
list of completed sets, in progress and conditions
under consideration can be found on the website
[211]. ICHOM has registered completed projects in
the COMET database after the COS has been agreed.
There has been a call for more transparency in the
reporting of methods used by ICHOM to develop
these core sets for routine care [212].
The continuous measurement of health care quality is
an essential aspect for the establishment of a high qual-
ity of care [213, 214]. Quality indicators are used to
measure structures, processes, indication and outcomes
of patient treatment [215]. National audits often include
assessment of data on patient outcomes, and COS may
be of relevance here also.
Due to the large number of quality indicators and their
heterogeneity, a global comparison even within medical
disciplines is hardly possible. For example, an audit of
the clinical guidelines from the National Institute for
Health and Care Excellence (NICE) found that a total of
1795 quality indicators were used [216]; in the German
health care system, there are nearly 2000 [217] and in
other health care systems, such as the USA or Canada,
up to 700 different quality indicators [218, 219] have
been recommended.
Core outcome sets could be a powerful, science-
grounded strategy to derive patient-relevant outcome
quality indicators and to obtain meaningful results to
compare quality of care between providers, regions, na-
tions and health care systems and thus to stimulate
value-based health care and the development of health
care systems. However, the methodological quality for
the development of most quality indicators is unclear
[220, 221].
Although major features of the established methods to
develop COS for trials also apply to other settings, the
requirements for measurement instruments to be rec-
ommended by a core set may differ between trials and
routine care or quality measurement.
4.3.3 Patient registries
Patient registries have been established for a variety of rea-
sons, including disease surveillance, studying the natural
course of a disease, post-market surveillance of health care
interventions, evaluation of interventions and assessment
of the quality of care [222]. Establishing or bringing
together existing national research registries that follow
the same methodology can provide a powerful research
platform, allowing the collection of higher-quality pro-
spective data.
Registries collecting the same minimum data set will
facilitate comparisons and pooling [223]. Although some
methodological guidelines and recommendations for the
development of comparable and interoperable patient
registries in cross-border settings exist [224], limited at-
tention has been paid to the development of consensus
around the COS to be measured and collected on pa-
tients within the registry. Projects are starting to appear
which incorporate an objective to develop a COS for pa-
tient disease registries, following similar methodology to
that described in this Handbook [162].
4.4 Conclusions
Interest in COS development continues to increase. To
reduce waste in research, and to avoid contributing fur-
ther to it, COS developers should pay attention to im-
plementation strategies in order to increase uptake.
Substantial progress has been made in several clinical
areas over recent years but there are many important
health conditions for which no COS currently exists or
is in development.
In this Handbook, we have presented an overview of
the research literature around COS development and
uptake. As evidence emerges, we will amend and dis-
seminate this guidance on COS development, the assess-
ment of uptake, and the review of COS through periodic
updates of this Handbook; whilst the latest additions to
this body of evidence can be found on the COMET
website.
