Abstract
In vitro models of the developing brain such as 3D brain organoids offer an unprecedented 
opportunity to study aspects of human brain development and disease. However, it remains 
undefined what cells are generated within organoids and to what extent they recapitulate the 
regional complexity, cellular diversity, and circuit functionality of the brain. Here, we analyzed 
gene expression in over 80,000 individual cells isolated from 31 human brain organoids. We find 
that organoids can generate a broad diversity of cells, which are related to endogenous classes, 
including cells from the cerebral cortex and the retina. Organoids could be developed over 
extended periods (over 9 months) enabling unprecedented levels of maturity including the 
formation of dendritic spines and of spontaneously-active neuronal networks. Finally, neuronal

 activity within organoids could be controlled using light stimulation of photoreceptor-like cells, 
which may offer ways to probe the functionality of human neuronal circuits using physiological 
sensory stimuli.
In recent years, reductionist in vitro models of the developing human brain have emerged in 
the form of 3D human brain organoids and spheroids derived from pluripotent stem cells, 
suitable for large-scale production and genetic engineering1. These systems offer an 
unprecedented opportunity to study both normal brain development and complex human 
diseases that affect multiple cell types, their interactions, and the function of neuronal 
circuits.
Thus far, organoid models have been applied to study events of neural progenitor 
dysfunction that occur during early stages of brain development, including microcephaly-
associated phenotypes2 and progenitor abnormalities resulting from Zika virus infections3–7. 
Organoids generated from patients with severe idiopathic Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) 
have also been used to implicate progenitor overproliferation and generation of excessive 
GABAergic neurons in this complex disease8. However, hurdles remain that preclude 
broader application of brain organoids to disease modeling 9.
Central issues include our incomplete understanding of the cellular composition of brain 
organoids, the potential of organoids to generate the regional and cellular diversity present in 
the brain, and the reproducibility of the cell-type spectrum generated within individual 
organoids.
It is also critical to understand whether 3D brain organoids can continue to develop in 
culture past early developmental events, to allow not only the generation of endogenous 
cellular diversity but also the maturation of neuronal networks, which will be needed to 
apply brain organoids to studies of late developmental events, such as complex cellular 
interactions and, most notably, higher-order brain functions that rely on functional neural 
networks.
Here we describe the prolonged development of human whole-brain organoids, and provide 
the largest-to-date molecular map of the diversity of cell types generated and its 
reproducibility across organoids. We show that organoids undergo substantial neuronal 
maturation, including generation of dendritic spines and the formation of spontaneously 
active neuronal networks. Finally, we demonstrate that neuronal activity within organoids is 
responsive to light-based stimulation of photosensitive cells, suggesting that organoid 
models may allow investigation of circuit functionality using physiological sensory 
mechanisms.
Protracted in vitro development of human whole-brain organoids
Human whole-brain organoids are largely self-patterning systems and therefore in principle 
have the potential to generate the vast cellular diversity of the endogenous tissue. However, 
this possibility remains largely untested. To address this point directly, we modified the 
culturing protocol first described by Lancaster et al.2,10 to foster extended periods of growth

 and development. By seeding initial embryoid bodies (EBs) with a reduced number of 
pluripotent stem cells (2,500 cells), optimizing neural induction, and adding BDNF to the 
final differentiation medium, we obtained long-term, progressive development for over 9 
months (mo) (Figure 1a, Extended Data Figure 1; see Methods). With this protocol, 
organoids do not become hypoxic, and levels of programmed cell death remain relatively 
low up to 9 mo (Extended Data Figure 1a). The yield of organoids from initial EBs was also 
improved, to >95% at 1 month with the iPSC11a line and 70% for HuES66.
To define the timeline of generation of broadly-defined cell classes, we analyzed a small set 
of informative single-gene markers by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in organoids derived 
from the iPSC11a line over 1 to 9 months in culture (Extended Data Figure 1b,c and 
Supplementary Discussion). At 1 mo, organoids exhibited early brain regionalization, 
expressing markers for germinal zones of the forebrain (Pax6 and Nkx2.1), midbrain (Otx2), 
hindbrain (Gbx2), and retina (VSX2, Otx2) (Extended Data Figure 1c,d). Resembling the 
endogenous sequence, neural progenitors emerged first, followed by glutamatergic (Vglut1), 
GABAergic (GABA), and dopaminergic (TH) neuronal identities and GFAP+ astroglia. The 
data indicate that whole brain organoids can develop for long periods of time and have the 
potential to generate cell types from distinct germinal zones of the brain and retina.
Large-scale, single-cell sequencing in human brain organoids reveals 
extensive diversity of cells
Individual gene markers cannot resolve the cellular diversity of the human brain, in which 
closely related cell classes can be identified only using combinatorial gene signatures. 
Single-cell RNA sequencing allows systematic interrogation of many genes, but the cellular 
diversity of the human brain requires that very large numbers of cells be profiled. To address 
this issue directly, we employed Drop-seq single-cell mRNA sequencing11 to molecularly 
profile 82,291 single cells isolated from 31 organoids derived from a healthy-control 
pluripotent stem cell line (iPSC line 11a) at 3 mo and 6 mo in vitro.
Starting with a relatively advanced stage of development, 6 mo, we sequenced an average of 
3,520 cells from each of 19 organoids grown in 4 separate bioreactors (range 1,656–11,061 
cells per organoid). Principal component analysis (PCA) of read counts was performed with 
dimensionality reduction using tSNE12–14 (see Methods). Clustering all cells from the 6 mo 
organoids produced ten main transcriptionally distinct populations (Figure 1b). We 
systematically compared the differentially expressed gene signatures for each cluster to gene 
signatures extracted from existing RNA-seq datasets of endogenous cell types11,15–27 
(Extended Data Figure 2). We were able to define the identity of the seven largest clusters 
(c1, c2, c3, c4, c5, c9 and c10) (Figure 1b).
Six of the seven clusters belonged to the neurectodermal lineage; however, one cluster (c1; 
3,027 cells) expressed mesodermal markers, including Myogenin and Myosin genes 
(MYH3, MYH8, MYL1, MYLPF), indicating that, despite early patterning to a 
neurectodermal fate, organoids can still produce a minority of cells of another embryonic 
origin.

 Cluster c2 (8,409 cells) was primarily composed of cells expressing genes of endogenous 
adult human astrocytes27, including canonical astrocyte markers AQP4 and GFAP. Cluster 
c9 (17,103 cells) contained progenitors of neuroepithelial origin, including cells with 
oligodendrocyte precursor-like identity20,26. Cluster c10 (13,428 cells) was mainly 
composed of cells with signatures of highly proliferative progenitors (e.g., TOP2A and 
MKI67). Cluster c3 (971 cells) was enriched for cells expressing neuronal genes, including 
dopaminergic markers (e.g., TH and EBF1). Perhaps the most interesting clusters were c4 
and c5 (12,378 and 9,919 cells, respectively) (Figure 2a–d). Cluster c4 had a clear neuronal 
signature, and was enriched for markers of neurons and progenitors of the cerebral cortex. 
Cluster c5 (9,919 cells) showed a strong representation of genes of the neural retina, such as 
the photoreceptor markers CRX and RCVRN28,29. Comparison with several gene expression 
datasets of mouse and human retina11,23,24 confirmed that this cluster was composed 
predominantly of retinal cells.
To quantify variability among organoids and possible bioreactor-based batch effects, we 
determined the frequency with which cells from each of the ten clusters were generated in 
individual organoids and across bioreactors (Figure 1c, Extended Data Figure 3 and 
Supplementary Discussion). We found that most clusters were consistently represented (c1, 
c2, c5, c9, c10; all >89% of organoids), although clusters c3 and c4 were present in only a 
subset of organoids (53% and 32%, respectively). Notably, organoids grown in the same 
bioreactor were more similar to each other in their ability to make cells of each cluster (e.g., 
100% of organoids from bioreactor 3 contained the forebrain cluster), suggesting that 
bioreactor-related growth environment is a key factor in controlling cell class identity 
(Extended Data Figure 3 and Supplementary Discussion).
Many cell types of the endogenous human forebrain and retina are 
identified within brain organoids
In order to understand to what degree endogenous cellular diversity is generated within 
organoids, we more closely dissected the forebrain and retina clusters (c4 and c5) by a 
second iteration of clustering. Within cluster c4, we identified 30 transcriptionally distinct 
sub-clusters (Figure 2a and data not shown); we were able to assign 17 of these to 5 broad 
cell type identities (Figure 2a). Sub-clusters (sb-c) 7–8 and sb-c 9–15 included neurons of 
putative corticofugal and callosal projection neuron identity, respectively. Sb-c 16–23 was 
enriched in human radial glia markers22, while sb-c 4 was distinguished by expression of 
canonical genes for intermediate progenitors, including EOMES and ELAV4. Finally, sb-c 1 
displayed molecular signatures of interneurons, including DLX5, DLX2, SCGN and GAD1.
We confirmed this similarity by correlating sub-cluster gene signatures with a previously 
published single-cell RNAseq dataset of human fetal cortex22 (see Methods). Despite the 
differences in the profiling methods used (Drop-seq vs. Fluidigm C1), we detected 
appropriate, preferential correlation between corresponding cell types for radial glia, 
interneurons, projection neurons and IPCs (Extended Data Figure 5a).
Next, we examined sub-clusters of the retina cluster (c5). Using class-specific retina markers 
identified in a previous Drop-seq analysis of 44,408 single cells from the murine retina11, we

 found that cluster c5 contained virtually all of the cell classes found in the mouse retina. 
Specifically, we identified populations corresponding to Muller glia cells (e.g., DKK3, 
SOX9), pigmented epithelial cells (e.g., MLANA, MITF), photoreceptors (e.g., CRX, 
RCVN, NRL), retinal ganglion cells (e.g., NEFL, NEFM), bipolar cells (e.g., LHX4, PCP2), 
and amacrine cells (e.g., TFAP2B, SLC32A1) (Figure 2c,e). To validate these identities, we 
correlated sub-cluster gene signatures to the mouse retina Drop-seq dataset11 (see Methods). 
Each of the organoid retinal populations showed strong correlation to the expected mouse 
retinal cell class (Extended Data Figure 5b).
Taken together, these analyses indicate that distinct cell types generated in organoids 
transcriptionally resemble the appropriate endogenous counterparts from the human fetal 
cortex and mouse retina.
To assess variability in cell type production, we examined organoids from bioreactors in 
which all organoids generated forebrain (bioreactor 3) or retina (bioreactors 1, 2 and 3) 
(Figure 2b,d, Extended Data Figure 4 and Supplementary Discussion). For the forebrain, 
callosal projection neurons and radial glia progenitors were present in all organoids sampled, 
while cortical interneurons, corticofugal projection neurons and intermediate progenitors 
were present in 50%. For retina, photoreceptors and pigmented epithelial cells developed in 
the majority of organoids (73% and 91%, respectively), while retinal ganglion cells, bipolar 
cells and amacrine cells (each ~55%) and Muller glia (36%) occurred more sporadically 
(Extended Data Figure 4b,d). This analysis likely overestimates the true variability, given the 
relatively small number of cells in each sub-cluster sampled from each organoid, and 
differences in robustness to dissociation and collection between cell types; indeed, IHC for 
known markers indicates a higher frequency of co-development of the same putative 
populations (Extended Data Figure 4a,c and Supplementary Discussion).
Protracted culture of human brain organoids leads to increased cell 
diversity and neuronal maturation
To evaluate whether additional cell types, and greater maturation, progressively emerge over 
time in culture, we performed Drop-seq analysis on an additional 15,402 cells from 3 mo 
organoids. We found that while some cell types were present at both 3 and 6 months, some 
appeared only at 6 mo. Of note, at 3 mo the forebrain cluster lacked the population of 
putative callosal projection neurons, which in vivo are born during late corticogenesis. 
Similarly, Muller glia and bipolar cells, normally generated at late stages of retina 
development, were absent from the 3 mo dataset (Figure 3a).
We next identified populations that were present at both 3 and 6 months and compared their 
molecular signatures between ages. First, we examined cells in the retina cluster that 
expressed the transcription factor CRX, which marks both developing and mature 
photoreceptors. Clustering all CRX-positive cells across both 3 and 6 mo organoids 
identified a sub-cluster (sb-c 7) (871 cells) which contained mature photoreceptors (Figure 
3b–d and Methods). Importantly, all but one of the cells in this cluster came from the 6 mo 
data set (Figure 3c).

 Cells of putative corticofugal projection neuron identity were present in both 3 and 6 month 
organoids and showed similar progressive maturation: functional clustering of gene sets 
(using DAVID 6.730) revealed a clear enrichment for genes involved in neuronal maturation 
at 6 mo, but not at 3 mo (data not shown). Finally, cells expressing astroglial markers at 3mo 
lacked markers of mature astrocytes (i.e., GFAP, AQP4 and AGT), which were present only 
at 6 mo (Figure 3a).
We then investigated whether the maturation of cells detected by molecular profiling was 
also reflected in structural traits of more mature neurons, including formation of synapses 
and the presence of dendritic spines.
The presynaptic marker synapsin 1 (SYN1) was absent at 1 mo but began to be expressed at 
3 mo, persisting for at least 9 mo (Figure 3e). Detection of VGAT+ and VGLUT1+ puncta 
suggested that both glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses were present (Figure 3f). 
Electron Microscopy (EM) imaging of an organoid at 8 months (Extended Data Figure 6), 
confirmed the presence of many structurally-defined synapses (Figure 3h).
Next, we used serial EM to examine neuronal morphology, and in particular dendritic spines, 
which are notoriously difficult to generate in vitro because neurons derived from pluripotent 
stem cells typically retain an embryonic identity. We reconstructed a ~16 × 16 × 5.4 μm 
region of an 8 mo organoid (Figure 3g) and identified a total of 129 synapses (0.088 
synapses per μm3, approximately in the range of human fetal cortex31; see Supplementary 
Discussion) (Figure 3h,i, videos S1 and S2). We analyzed 100 of these synapses; with two 
exceptions (two objects both receiving and making synapses), processes were either 
exclusively pre-synaptic (57 objects, axons) or exclusively post-synaptic (54 objects, 
dendrites), often making more than one synapse in the volume. The labeled dendrites had a 
total of 37 spines, which were variable in shape, but were often innervated by a synapse; 30 
of these synapses were made on spines (Figure 3j,k, video S3).
These data indicate that long-term culture of human brain organoids allows continuing 
development to ultimately produce great cellular diversity and unprecedented neuronal 
maturation.
Human brain organoids develop spontaneously active neuronal networks 
and photosensitive cells
Given the enhanced maturity of the neurons generated, we investigated whether 
spontaneously active neuronal networks were present. We performed extracellular 
recordings with high-density silicon microelectrodes32 (Figure 4a and Extended Data Figure 
7a), and were able to isolate spikes in six out of seven 8 mo organoids (11 recording sites, 32 
units in total), with a median mean firing rate of 0.66 Hz (Q1–3=0.20–2.08 Hz). Spike rate 
was suppressed by bath application of TTX (2 μM), a voltage gated sodium channel 
antagonist (n=4 organoids; data not shown); together with the correspondence of the unit 
waveforms to standard structure, and the presence of typical refractory periods (Figure 4b 
and Extended Data Figure 7b), this indicates that the isolated spikes are action potentials. In

 contrast, no spontaneously firing neurons were detected in 4 mo organoids (n = 4 organoids; 
Figure 4c), in line with the progressive maturation seen in our single-cell transcriptome data.
To determine if active neurons were functionally connected, we analyzed the spike train 
cross-correlograms and detected positive peaks with a short lag time, indicative of excitatory 
mono-synaptic connections33,34 (Figure 4d). Bath application of 20 μM NBQX35 
significantly reduced the firing rate by 81% (Figure 4e), suggesting that the majority of 
recorded spikes were being driven by non-NMDA receptor mediated excitatory synaptic 
transmission.
We next assessed active neuronal networks by examining population firing characteristics. In 
all spontaneously active organoids (n=6), for the majority of isolated units, the statistical 
structure of the time-series indicated the presence of network activity (Extended Data Figure 
7d). Three of these organoids displayed obvious burst firing patterns (Figure 4f, bottom 
panel), while the remaining 3 showed relatively stable firing patterns (Figure 4f, top panel). 
In bursting organoids, we observed sets of neurons displaying periods of coordinated activity 
(i.e., population bursts; 3 recording sites from 2 organoids). Interestingly, within these 
periods the order of neuronal recruitment and firing showed a clear and reproducible 
temporal structure (Figure 4g), reflected by asymmetry in the cross-correlograms (Extended 
Data Figure 7g). These results suggest that brain organoids establish neuronal networks that 
can support self-organized patterns of activity.
Our single-cell RNAseq analysis indicates that long-term cultures of human brain organoids 
support the differentiation of photoreceptor-like cells equipped with key proteins for light 
responsiveness. This is in agreement with the finding that retina organoids display 
photosensitive cells36. We therefore tested whether light-based physiological sensory stimuli 
could modulate neuronal activity. We investigated the effect of 530 nm light on the firing 
rate of 25 cells recorded from 10 organoids (7–9 mo), and identified a sub-population of 
neurons that displayed attenuated firing rates after light exposure (4 out of the 10 organoids 
tested had light-responsive units, Figure 4h and Extended Data Figure 7h,i). In agreement, 
cFos, an activity-dependent gene, was upregulated in 8 mo organoids after light exposure 
(Figure 4i). The data indicate that brain organoids establish spontaneously-active neuronal 
networks and generate functional photo-sensitive cells, which may in the future permit 
modulation of network activity using physiological sensory mechanisms.
Discussion
Human brain organoids have enormous potential to serve as in vitro models of the human 
brain. Fulfillment of this promise, however, requires a deeper knowledge of their cellular 
composition, and a better understanding of the extent and reproducibility with which they 
generate the cellular diversity of the brain, produce mature neuronal traits, and develop 
functional neuronal networks. We applied a very large single-cell transcriptional profiling to 
establish that human whole-brain organoids can achieve extensive development and 
maturation and generate an unprecedented diversity of cell types. In agreement with prior 
work examining a smaller number of cells from early-stage organoids17, the cells generated 
are closely related to their endogenous counterparts of the brain and retina.

 In addition to mapping cellular diversity in organoids, we provide a first measure of the 
organoid-to-organoid variability in the generation of each cell type, and identify types that 
are reproducibly generated and others that appear more sporadically. Notably, this variability 
relates at least partly to bioreactor-based batch effects, suggesting a need for strategies to 
better control growth environment or to identify “successful” bioreactors a priori.
We find that upon maturation organoids acquire structural traits of mature neurons, including 
dendritic spine-like structures, which have been notoriously difficult to generate by in vitro 
directed differentiation. This offers the opportunity to study a new set of developmental 
processes, such as human synaptic pruning and active spine refinement, which could not 
previously be modeled in vitro.
By 8 months, whole-brain organoids also generate spontaneously-active neurons and 
neuronal networks, as well as photosensitive cells that can respond to non-invasive, light-
based sensory stimulation. While we could not determine whether light directly alters the 
activity of photosensitive cells or modulates downstream neuronal networks, the work 
suggests that this model may make it possible to study the response of neuronal networks to 
physiological sensory stimuli, in parallel with engineered optogenetic systems. In future 
work, it will be important to identify the neuron types participating in these networks, 
ideally via strategies that link whole cell patch-clamp recordings to single-cell 
transcriptomes.
The diversity and maturation of cell types generated, the robustness of the neuronal 
networks, the presence of structural traits of mature neurons, and the possibility of using 
sensory experience to modulate neuronal activity collectively suggest that, beyond modeling 
early events of progenitor biology, these 3D brain organoids have the potential to model 
higher-order functions of the human brain, such as cellular interactions and neural circuit 
dysfunctions related to neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric pathologies.
Methods
Pluripotent stem cell culture
Human pluripotent stem cells used in these experiments were from the hiPSC11a line37 (gift 
from the Eggan lab, Harvard University), which we confirmed to be karyotipically normal. 
Cells were maintained in 10-cm tissue culture dishes (Corning) coated with 1% Geltrex 
membrane matrix (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in mTeSR medium (Stemcell Technologies). 
PSCs and colonies were dissociated with Gentle Cell Dissociation Reagent (Stemcell 
Technologies). All human pluripotent stem cells were maintained below passage 50 and 
confirmed negative for mycoplasma.
Long-term cultures of human brain organoids
Cerebral organoids were generated using a modified version of the protocol published by 
Lancaster et al.10. Embryoid bodies (EBs) were derived by dissociating PSCs colonies and 
plating 2,500 single cells in each well of a 96-well plate. EBs were cultured as described 
in 10. After five days in culture, EBs were transferred to Intermediate Induction Medium 
(IIM), consisting of DMEM/F12, 6% KOSR (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 0.9% FBS

(Invitrogen), minimum-essential-media non-essential amino acids (MEM-NEAA) (Thermo 
Fisher Scientific), heparin 0.7 μg/ml (Sigma). Two days after plating in IIM, 500 μl of 
Neural Induction Medium (NIM) were added to each well. Following neural induction, 
organoids were embedded in Matrigel and transferred to cerebral differentiation medium 
(CDM) as described in10. A total of 40 organoids were added to each spinner flask, and 
medium was changed once every six days for the duration of the culture process. After one 
month, brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was supplemented to the CDM medium at 
a concentration of 14 ng/ml. Cerebral organoids were cultured for up to 13 months. For 
induction of hypoxia, six-month organoids were cultured in cerebral differentiation medium 
supplemented with 100μM cobalt (II) chloride (Millipore) in a conventional incubator 
(37°C; 5% C02) for 24 hours before fixation.
Histology and immunofluorescence
Cerebral organoids were fixed by immersion in 4% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy 
Services), cryoprotected in 30% sucrose solution and then embedded in optimum cutting 
temperature (OCT) compound (Tissue Tek). Organoids were then cryosectioned at a 
thickness of 14 or 30 μm.
Immunohistochemistry was performed as previously described38. Primary antibodies and 
dilutions used were as listed at the end of this paragraph. Fluorescently-conjugated 
secondary antibodies used were Goat anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor 488, 546 and 647 (Life

anti-mouse 546 (Life Technologies A10036), Alexa Fluor donkey anti-goat 546 (Life 
Technologies A-11056), Alexa Fluor donkey anti-mouse (Life Technologies A31571), Alexa 
Fluor donkey anti-rabbit 647 (Life Technologies A10040). Secondary antibodies were 
diluted 1:1200. Rhodopsin immunohistochemistry was performed without Triton X-100 or 
Tween 20 to preserve membrane integrity, and signal was amplified using biotin (1:500, 
Vector BA9200) and streptavidin (1:600, Thermo Fisher S32354) conjugates. Cell nuclei 
were stained with Hoechst staining (1:5,000; Invitrogen), and slides were mounted using 
Fluoromount-G mounting medium.

Microscopy and image analysis
All mounted sections were imaged using a Nikon Eclipse Ti microscope, analyzed with NIS 
Elements analysis software and processed using ImageJ. Confocal images were obtained 
using a Zeiss 700 confocal microscope. Images were collected and analyzed using the Zen 
2010 program. For EM, images were processed using ImageJ, manually segmented using 
VAST Lite (freely available at https://software.rc.fas.harvard.edu/lichtman/vast/), and 
rendered in 3ds Max (Autodesk, Inc).
Drop-seq single cell sequencing
For the 6 mo dataset, we sequenced 19 organoids from 4 bioreactors: 4 organoids from 
bioreactor 1 (Org1A, 3,547 cells; Org1B, 3,463 cells; Org1C, 3,698 cells; Org1D, 2,811 
cells), 3 organoids from bioreactor 2 (Org2A, 2,238 cells; Org2B, 3,159 cells; Org2C, 2,708 
cells), 4 organoids from bioreactor 3 (Org3A, 4,225 cells; Org3B, 2,557 cells; Org3C, 3,614 
cells; Org3D, 11,061 cells) and 8 organoids from bioreactor 4 (Org4A, 1,656 cells; Org4B, 
1,663 cells; Org4C, 1,795 cells; Org4D, 2,151 cells; Org4E, 3,407 cells; Org4F 7,443 cells; 
Org4G, 2,905 cells; Org4H, 2,788 cells). For the 3 mo dataset, we sequenced 12 organoids

 Droplets containing single cells and barcoded micro-particles were generated and processed 
as described in 11. Briefly, droplets were collected and beads were recovered and processed 
for immediate reverse transcription. The resulting cDNA was amplified, fragmented and 
further amplified using the Nextera XT DNA library preparation kit. Sequencing was 
performed on the Illumina NextSeq 500.
Clustering of cells derived from 6-month organoids was performed using the Seurat R 
package12, with some modifications from the procedure described previously11. Clustering 
was done in two iterative rounds of principal components analysis (PCA). First, digital gene 
expression matrices were column-normalized and log-transformed. Cells with fewer than 
400 expressed genes were removed from analysis. A set of variable genes was then 
identified by binning the average expression of all genes into 300 evenly sized groups and 
computing the median dispersion (variance divided by the mean) in each bin. Genes were 
selected for inclusion in PCA that had higher than twice the median dispersion, minus the 
minimum value (final set: 1,568 genes). The edges of a nearest neighbor graph were 
generated by computing the fraction of shared nearest neighbors amongst cells in the first 20 
PC dimensions using the approximate nearest neighbors package (ANN) in R (CRAN), 
setting the k parameter to 25 (“BuildSNN” function in Seurat). A first round of clustering 
with the Louvain modularity-based community detection algorithm39 set at a resolution of 
0.01 was used to generate a total of 10 first-round clusters (“FindClusters” function in 
Seurat). The largest 50% of the cells from each of these clusters was again subjected to gene 
selection and PCA. These PCs were evaluated for statistically significant gene expression 
signals using the Jackstraw method11,40 (“JackStraw” function in Seurat). At most 15 PCs 
were used in this second round of clustering by Louvain, with the resolution parameter set at 
3. The resulting clusters were compared pairwise for differential expression, as in11, and 
clusters with fewer than 10 genes differentially expressed by more than 2-fold were merged, 
producing 202 clusters. For analysis of organoid-to-organoid variability, organoids were 
excluded from a given cluster if they contributed less than 1% of the cells in that cluster.
Correlation analysis between gene expression in a dataset of human fetal cortex22 against the 
astrocyte cluster (c2) and the identified subclusters of the forebrain cluster (c4) was 
performed using the log average expression of a set of 104 genes, identified by taking the 
top 10 most differentially expressed genes for each cluster pair in the published fetal cortex 
dataset (some of which overlapped) as the most informative for distinguishing the reported 
endogenous cell classes of the cortex. We then constructed expression profiles for the six 
organoid cell groups and measured the correlation of gene expression levels for the 104 
endogenous genes, comparing each of the endogenous cortical cell classes to each of the 
organoid cell groups. For the retinal subclusters (subclusters of c5), we repeated this 
correlation analysis against a dataset of P14 mouse retina11, using 110 genes, identified by 
taking the top 10 most enriched genes from the 11 major cell classes (horizontal cells, retinal 
ganglion cells, amacrine cells, photoreceptors, bipolar cells, and six glial retinal types) in the 
mouse dataset, and correlating against the expression profiles of the orthologous human 
genes in the six organoid retinal cell groups.

 Electron microscopy
An 8 month old organoid was immersion-fixed in 2.5% Paraformaldehyde, 2.5% 
Glutaraldehyde in 0.1M Sodium Cacodylate buffer (EMS #15949) at room temperature for 
24h. The organoid was washed in cold 0.15M Sodium Cacodylate buffer (Caco buffer), 
embedded in 4% low-melt agarose, and sectioned into 100 micrometer thick slices (Leica 
Vibratome) in cold Caco buffer (Extended Data Figure 6). 3 slices were selected for further 
processing. The results shown in Figure 3 and Extended Data Figure 6 come from one of 
those slices.
Preparation for EM was similar to that previously described41. Briefly, sections were washed 
in cold Caco buffer and stained for 2h in reduced 2% Osmium Tetroxide solution (with 15 
mg/ml Potassium Ferrocyanide) on ice, washed, incubated in 1% Thiocarbohydrazide 
solution for 30 minutes, washed again, and finally stained with 2% Osmium Tetroxide 
solution for 1h (ROTO method). Slices were then dehydrated in a series of ascending 
Ethanol concentrations, followed by Acetone and Propylene Oxide, infiltrated with mixtures 
of Epoxy resin (variants of EPON) and Propylene Oxide, and embedded in 100% epoxy 
resin and cured at 60°C for two weeks. Blocks were trimmed and sectioned at 40 nm slice 
thickness with a Leica EM UC6 Ultramicrotome, and serial sections were collected on 
carbon-coated Kapton tape using an ATUM41. Strips of tape were mounted on silicon wafers 
and sections were post-stained with 2% Uranyl Acetate and Lead Aspartate (Leica 
Ultrastain). Slices were then imaged in a Zeiss Sigma scanning electron microscope.
A stack of 136 slice images was acquired using backscatter electron imaging (9 kV, 3 μs 
dwell time per pixel, 122882 pixels at 4 nm resolution). A roughly aligned region of 40962 
pixels was cropped from the images and aligned using ImageJ (“Linear Stack Alignment 
with SIFT”, using expected transformation: Affine). The resulting aligned image stack was 
imported into VAST Lite for manual segmentation (freely available at https://
software.rc.fas.harvard.edu/lichtman/vast/). 3D rendering was done in in 3ds Max 
(Autodesk, Inc). Data analysis was performed in Matlab (The Mathworks, Inc.). We noted 
that axons, more than dendrites, appeared to preferentially run parallel to the organoid 
surface (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, p<10−5; Figure 3i, video S2). For the Wilcoxon rank-sum 
test we first performed a principal component analysis of the point cloud of each axon and 
dendrite, and used the vertical components of each largest principal component of all axons 
vs. all dendrites.
Electrophysiology
Cerebral organoids were randomly selected and transferred from the culture flask to a 
recording chamber containing artificial cerebrospinal fluid composed of (in mM) NaCl 
(125.0), D-Glucose (10.0), NaHCO3 (26.2), KCl (3.5), NaH2PO4 (1.3), MgCl2 (1.0), CaCl2 
(1.2), L-Ascorbic acid (1.0), and Na-Pyruvate (1.0), bubbled with carbogen (95% O2, 5% 
CO2). In the recording chamber, the organoid was immobilized by placing it on a small grid 
of spikes. Prior to recording, the organoids were initially held at 32 °C for 30 minutes, 
followed by a further 30 minutes acclimatisation at 36 °C (the recording temperature). The 
temperature of the recording chamber was monitored and maintained by a temperature 
control unit (TC-344C, Warner Instruments), and a custom built heating platform. During

 acclimatization and electrophysiological recordings, the organoids were maintained in the 
absence of ambient light. Extracellular silicon probes were positioned by a 
micromanipulator (Scientifica PatchStar) under infrared illumination (850nm LED) using a 
digital microscope (Dino-Lite Edge AM4115-FIT). Extracellular neurophysiological signals 
were recorded using high density silicon probes32 with a two-column, 32-row configuration 
of 9×9 μm PEDOT electroplated gold recording sites of 12 μm pitch. Signals were processed 
and digitized on a headstage proximal to the silicon probe (Intan RHD2000 chip, 30 kS/s per 
channel, 0.1 Hz high pass filter, 7.6 kHz anti-aliasing filter, 16-bit ADC), then acquired by a 
NeuroNexus SmartBox system. Wide-band data was stored for analysis. Spike detection was 
carried out by SpikeDetekt. The initial spike clustering was done by an unsupervised masked 
EM algorithm (KlustaKwik), followed by a stage of manual curation aided by KlustaViewa 
software (full procedure is described in 42). In order to show raw signal (Figure 4b), we 
applied a 117 Hz high-pass Daubechies 4 wavelet filter.
Spontaneous neuronal activity was recorded for at least 10 minutes. A cerebral organoid was 
classified as not active when no spontaneous action potentials were detected during 40 min 
of recording in at least 3 different recording sites. The 99% confidence bounds for the fano 
factor were approximated by a gamma distribution43. Mono-synaptic connections were 
identified by the detection of peaks or troughs, with a short time lag (< 5 ms), in the spike-
train cross-correlograms33,34. The statistical threshold for the identification of connected 
pairs was set at the 99.9th percentile of the cumulative Poisson distribution for the estimated 
spike rate, which was calculated by convolving the cross-correlogram (0.5 ms bins) with a 
Gaussian window (s.d. 10 ms).
Light stimulation was controlled by in-house MATLAB scripts. Briefly, a national 
instruments board (NI PCIe-6323, X Series DAQ) was used to deliver TTL pulses to an 
external LED driver (LEDD1B, ThorLabs). For light stimulation, a 530 nm LED (Thorlabs, 
M530L3) was single band-pass filtered (11 nm bandwidth, Semrock FF01-530/11) and 
collimated. Using a calibrated meter and photodiode (PM100D and S130C, Thorlabs), the 
maximum LED power output was set to 300 μW/cm2, and the final output controlled by 
pulse width modulation. During light stimulation, ninety 200 ms pulses of 530 nm light were 
delivered at 0.2 Hz (the first 30 were 30 μW/cm2, the second 30 were at 100 μW/cm2, the 
final 30 were at 300 μW/cm2).
For the analysis of the light experiment, the mean spike rate recorded during a 5 min period 
post-light stimulus was normalized to a 5 minute period immediately before light 
stimulation. The baseline normalized spike rate was then fit by a series of Gaussian mixture 
models, with 1 to 4 components. Minimization of the Bayes Information Criterion was used 
to identify the optimal number of components. Post-fitting, data was partitioned according to 
the fit component with the largest posterior probability, weighted by the component 
probability. All analysis was done in Matlab, using statistics toolbox version 9.0 
(fitgmdist.m and cluster.m). 4 units were excluded from analysis based on a mean baseline 
spike rate < 0.1 Hz (2 iPSC11a units and 2 HuES66 units).

 Stock solutions of 2,3-Dioxo-6-nitro-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrobenzo[f]quinoxaline-7-sulfonamide 
disodium salt (NBQX disodium salt, Abcam; 100 mM) and Tetrodotoxin citrate (TTX, 
Abcam; 10 mM) were prepared in dd.H20.
All descriptive statistics and statistical tests were performed in MATLAB (version 8.3, 
R2014a, The MathWorks, Inc.), using the Statistics Toolbox (version 9.0, R2014a, The 
MathWorks, Inc.). The Lilliefors test was used to test for normality of data distributions. As 
the null hypothesis that the mean spike rates are normally distributed was rejected at the 5% 
level (p <0.001), appropriate non-parametric tests for paired and independent data sets were 
used to test for significance. All data sets met the assumptions of the applied statistical tests. 
Mean spike rate data is presented as Tukey style box plots, showing the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd 
quantile (Q1, M (median), & Q3 respectively; inter-quartile range, IQR = Q3-Q1). Box plot 
whiskers extend to the most extreme data points between Q1-1.5*IQR and Q3+1.5*IQR. For 
illustrative purposes, all data points outside the whiskers are plotted individually. When 
comparing groups, the equality of the variance was tested at the 5% significance level by a 
two-tailed squared ranks test. All statistical tests applied to the electrophysiological data 
were two-tailed, with a 5% significance level.

fano factor greater than 1 indicates that the unit firing is not well modeled by a stationary 
Poisson distribution, and points at the presence of network activity. f. Plot of the fano factor 
calculated across the whole recording versus the fano factor calculated during the population

factor of 1. Black symbols correspond to units with a fano factor close to 1, consistent with a 
stationary Poisson distributed system and implying a fixed firing profile during the first 
second of population burst. g. Spike train auto-correlogram (color) and cross-correlogram

the Bayes Information Criterion (BIC) generated for the Gaussian mixture models with k

bimodal distribution (see middle panel). i. Population averaged activity for the two 
populations of neurons (responders in red, n=4 neurons; non-responders in blue, n=21

 Figure 1. Large-scale, single-cell sequencing demonstrates development of a broad spectrum of 
cell types in human brain organoids
a. Schematic of long-term culture of brain organoids. Dissociated human iPSCs are seeded 
at day 0 into round-bottom plates to allow EB formation (day 2–5). After a two-step neural 
induction (day 6–10), EBs are embedded in Matrigel (day 10) and transferred to spinning 
bioreactors (day 15) for long-term culture. BDNF is added starting at 1 month. 
Immunohistochemistry (IHC), single cell RNA-sequencing (Drop-seq), electrophysiology 
(E-phys) and electron microscopy (EM) were performed at different timepoints. b. t-SNE 
plot of single-cell mRNA sequencing data from 6 mo organoids. A total of 66,889 cells were 
clustered into 10 distinct groups. c. Same as in b, with cells color-coded by organoid of 
origin.
