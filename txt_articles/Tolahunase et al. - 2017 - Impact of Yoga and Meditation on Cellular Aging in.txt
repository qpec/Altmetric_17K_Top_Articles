This study was designed to explore the impact of Yoga and Meditation based lifestyle intervention (YMLI) on cellular aging in
apparently healthy individuals. During this 12-week prospective, open-label, single arm exploratory study, 96 apparently healthy
individuals were enrolled to receive YMLI. The primary endpoints were assessment of the change in levels of cardinal biomarkers
of cellular aging in blood from baseline to week 12, which included DNA damage marker 8-hydroxy-2Û∏Ä†-deoxyguanosine (8-
OH2dG), oxidative stress markers reactive oxygen species (ROS), and total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and telomere attrition
markers telomere length and telomerase activity. The secondary endpoints were assessment of metabotrophic blood biomarkers
associated with cellular aging, which included cortisol, ùõΩ-endorphin, IL-6, BDNF, and sirtuin-1. After 12 weeks of YMLI, there were
significant improvements in both the cardinal biomarkers of cellular aging and the metabotrophic biomarkers influencing cellular
aging compared to baseline values. The mean levels of 8-OH2dG, ROS, cortisol, and IL-6 were significantly lower and mean levels
of TAC, telomerase activity, ùõΩ-endorphin, BDNF, and sirtuin-1 were significantly increased (all values ùëù < 0.05) post-YMLI. The
mean level of telomere length was increased but the finding was not significant (ùëù = 0.069). YMLI significantly reduced the rate of
cellular aging in apparently healthy population.
1. Introduction
In the last decade there has been a significant increase in
complex lifestyle diseases like depression, diabetes mellitus
(DM), cardiovascular diseases (CVD), cancer, and infertility.
These diseases are strongly associated with accelerated cellu-
lar aging [1, 2] and have become the bane of modern society
[3‚Äì5]. Within a homogeneous sample of apparently healthy
adult population, biomarkers have been defined recently [6]
to characterize the complex processes of accelerated aging
phenomenon. Although we do not have any gold standard
biomarker to monitor healthy aging, based on the current
knowledge of putative biomarkers, the cardinal biomarkers
of cellular aging and metabotophic biomarkers which can
influence them have become the focus of latest translational
research to develop interventions to prevent chronic lifestyle
diseases.
The cardinal biomarkers of cellular aging include DNA
damage, telomere length attrition, and oxidative stress (OS)
[7]. DNA damage causes genomic instability which is respon-
sible for cellular dysfunctions in the pathogenesis of lifestyle
diseases [8‚Äì10]. OS is the most important cause for DNA
damage. Although many different oxidative DNA damage
(ODD) products have been identified 8-OH2dG (8-hydroxy-
2Û∏Ä†-deoxyguanosine), a highly mutagenic oxidative DNA
adduct has been the subject of intensive study and is a defini-
tive biomarker of DNA damage [11]. Telomere attrition is due
to altered telomere metabolism involving decrease in telom-
erase enzyme activity and OS. It contributes to genomic insta-
bility and is associated with aging and lifestyle diseases [12].

Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevity
Oxidative stress, an imbalance between the prooxidants
and the antioxidant defense mechanisms, becomes patholog-
ical at both extremes of the physiological range needed for
normal cellular functions. It is involved in the pathogenesis
of complex lifestyle and chronic diseases [13] including
depression [14], obesity [15], and infertility [16, 17], the
leading public health problems.
Several metabotrophic blood biomarkers influencing cel-
lular aging include biomarkers of stress and inflamma-
tory response, neuroplasticity, and longevity. Sustained stress
response due to chronic stress stimuli causes constantly
increased cortisol levels [18], which lead to systemic tissue
abnormalities like increased adiposity and neurodegenera-
tion. The level of stress responsiveness (cortisol levels) can be
a biomarker for predicting susceptibility to lifestyle diseases
[19]. Accelerated aging is characterized by a chronic, low-
grade inflammation (‚Äúinflammaging‚Äù). Inflammaging is a
highly significant risk factor for most of chronic lifestyle
diseases [20] and is a potential modifiable target [21]. IL-6
is the most prominent cytokine in inflammaging and is both
a marker of inflammatory status and a hallmark of chronic
morbidity [22]. Impaired neuroplasticity due to accelerated
aging can have negative influence across the entire lifespan
[23]. BDNF is a major regulator of neuroplasticity [24], which
may be increased in specific regions of the brain by various
interventions [25]. Health span and longevity are influenced
by several factors. Sirtuin-1 (SIRT1), a histone deacetylase
(HDAC), is prominent among them and recently has become
a target for various interventions [26]. It systemically influ-
ences nutrition and energy metabolism and centrally has a
role in circadian rhythm, survival against stress [27] and
neuronal plasticity [28].
A variety of interventions have been studied [29, 30] to
determine their influence on preventing lifestyle diseases and
promoting health and longevity. They include drugs targeting
specific hallmarks of aging, namely, physical exercise [31],
nutrition, caloric restriction [32], and antioxidants [33]. How-
ever, no single intervention is shown to be an effective pre-
ventive and therapeutic strategy for modern complex lifestyle
diseases and provide comprehensive benefits for delaying or
reversing accelerated aging. Therefore, further research is
needed to find optimum interventions for population at risk
of lifestyle diseases. Yoga is an emerging integrative health
discipline, which can positively modulate mind and body [34]
and has been shown to improve clinical profile of patients
with various pathologies [35] including depression, obesity,
hypertension, asthma, type II diabetes, and cancer. However,
recent reviews on Yoga suggest that potential underlying
mechanisms need to be further explored [36]. Studies on
biomarkers of disease and health in Yoga based interventions
are limited and they have only highlighted diabetic and lipid
profiles [37, 38], stress and inflammatory markers [39, 40]
and neuroimaging correlates [41], in populations with specific
medical conditions. Evidence is lacking regarding the efficacy
of Yoga lasting short duration of 3 to 12 weeks in improving
the biomarkers of cellular aging in apparently healthy people.
Thus, the present study was designed to evaluate the impact
of Yoga and Meditation based lifestyle intervention (YMLI)
on cellular aging and longevity by analyzing cardinal and
metabotrophic biomarkers in the peripheral blood of appar-
ently healthy subjects.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Study Design and Participants. Ninety-six apparently
healthy people were enrolled in this 12-week prospective,
open-label, single arm exploratory study, from Aug 2015 to
May 2016, designed to explore the impact of YMLI on cellular
aging. The key inclusion criteria were male or female aged
30‚Äì65 years and leading unhealthy modern lifestyle. The
key exclusion criteria were inability to perform the yogic
exercises due to any physical challenges and those with recent
changes in lifestyle during last 3 months. The study was
initiated after ethical clearance (ESC/T-370/22-07-2015) and
the registration of the trial with Clinical Trial Registry of
India (CTRI REF/2014/09/007532).
2.2. Procedure
2.2.1. Yoga and Meditation Based Lifestyle Intervention
(YMLI). Eligible subjects were enrolled in the study after
screening and baseline characteristics were recorded. Partici-
pants underwent 12-week pretested YMLI program compris-
ing theory and practice sessions [42, 43]. YMLI is designed
to be an integrative health strategy incorporating the classic
components of Yoga including Asanas (physical postures),
Pranayama (breathing exercises), and Dhayna (Meditation)
which are derived from a mix of Hatha Yoga and Raja Yoga.
The YMLI for the current study was suitably modified for
apparently healthy subjects. YMLI program included sessions
5 days per week for 12 wks. For the first two weeks the sessions
were held at integrated health clinic (IHC), AIIMS, New
Delhi, and taught by registered, specialized Yoga instructors
(educational qualifications include Bachelor of Naturopathy
and Yoga Sciences and P.G. Diploma in Yoga Therapy).
Remaining 10 weeks were home based. Monitoring of com-
pliance of the home based YMLI was through maintenance
of a dairy and telephonic contact. The details of the activities
in a day during YMLI program are given in Table 1. Each
session in YMLI included a set of Asanas (physical postures),
Pranayama (breathing exercises), and Dhayna (Meditation)
for approximately 90 minutes. This was followed by an
interactive lecture (only during the first two weeks of YMLI
at IHC) on lifestyle, lifestyle diseases, and importance of their
prevention for 30 minutes.
2.2.2. Laboratory Procedures. During this 12-week study the
participants were evaluated for various biomarkers on day
0 and week 12. Fasting venous blood samples (5 mL) were
collected and divided into two parts. One part was allowed to
clot and the serum was separated within 30 min and the other
part was transferred to heparinized/EDTA vials and was
centrifuged at 2000ùëî for 15 minutes at 4‚àòC. Both serum and
plasma were stored at ‚àí80‚àòC until analyzed. ROS detection
was done by chemiluminescence assay (Berthold detection
luminometer, USA). Peripheral blood leukocyte telomere
length was measured by qPCR method and telomerase activ-
ity was determined by using a telomerase assay kit (Roche,

estimated in white blood cell DNA (Cayman‚Äôs EIA kit).
ELISA kits were used for levels of TAC (Cayman Chemical,
Ann Arbor, USA), cortisol (DRG Diagnostic, Germany),
ùõΩ-endorphin (Phoenix Pharmaceuticals, Inc.), IL-6 (Gen-
Probe, Diaclone Diagnostic, France), BDNF (Raybiotech,
Inc), and sirtuin-1 (Quayee Bio-Technology). Quality-control
assays for biomarkers and validation were performed.
2.2.3. Endpoints. The primary endpoint was to assess the
change in levels of cardinal biomarkers of cellular aging
from baseline to week 12. The biomarkers included the
following: 8-OH2dG, ROS, and TAC (markers of OS and
ODD) and telomere attrition markers telomere length and
telomerase activity. The secondary endpoints were assess-
ment of metabotrophic blood biomarkers associated with
cellular aging, which included cortisol, ùõΩ-endorphin, IL-6,
BDNF, and sirtuin-1 from baseline to week 12.
2.3. Statistical Analysis. Data were analyzed using SPSS 20
(IBM Corp, Armonk, NY). Descriptive statistics are reported
as means and standard deviations. Changes in outcome vari-
ables were analyzed using paired-samples t-test. Exploratory
analysis included comparisons for within gender subgroups
using paired-sample t-test. Significance was accepted at ùëù <
0.05.
3. Results
The flow diagram of participation details is provided in
Figure 1. Of 96 subjects, 94 subjects were assessed for impact
analysis. Two subjects were excluded from analysis due to
poor compliance to the program. Baseline sociodemographic
characteristics are shown in Table 2.
After 12 weeks of YMLI, there was significant improve-
ment in both cardinal and metabotrophic biomarkers of cel-
lular aging compared to baseline values (Table 3). The mean
levels of 8-OH2dG and ROS were significantly lower and
mean levels of TAC and telomerase activity were significantly
increased (all values ùëù < 0.05). The mean level of telomere
length was increased but finding was not significant (ùëù =
0.069). The mean levels of cortisol and IL-6 were significantly

the levels of IL-6 and a more marked reduction in cortisol
levels (males ùëù = 0.001; females ùëù = 0.036). After 12 weeks of
YMLI, we also noted significantly reduced BMI in the study
population (ùëù < 0.01).
4. Discussion
The results of this study highlight the positive impact of
YMLI on biomarkers of cellular aging and in promoting
cellular longevity through changes in both cardinal and
metabotrophic biomarkers. The findings suggest that the
impact is mediated through improvement in genomic sta-
bility, telomere metabolism, and balance of cellular oxidative
stress, well-regulated stress and inflammatory responses, and
increase in neuroplasticity and nutrition sensing.
Genomic stability is central to cellular longevity and
disease-free youthful healthy life and findings from our study
suggest the reduction of genomic instability (decreased levels
of 8-OH2dG) by YMLI. Unhealthy social habits (smoking,
excess alcohol intake, etc.), sedentary lifestyle, exposure
to environmental pollutants, and intake of processed and
nutritionally depleted food have taken a toll on human health
with onset of lifestyle diseases at a much younger age [3‚Äì5].
These environmental and lifestyle factors are responsible for
genomic instability [10]. DNA damage to both mitochondrial
and nuclear genome from endogenous as well as exogenous
insults results in accumulation of genetic aberrations and
genome hypermutability [8‚Äì10].
This is mainly due to aberrant DNA damage response
(DDR) pathway, which is essential for DNA repair and
for monitoring genomic integrity. Deficient DNA repair
triggers systemic effects to promote pathological aging [10].
Reduction of DNA damage by YMLI suggests potential of
yoga in activating DDR pathway to repair genomic damage
and improve genomic stability and changes in metabotrophic
factors seen in the study may be associated with these
benefits.
Maintaining telomere length through regulation of
telomere metabolism contributes to genomic stability and
reduction in telomere attrition (increase in telomere length
and telomerase activity levels) shown by our study after YMLI
suggests the potential for yoga in telomere metabolism and
cellular longevity. Telomeres, which serve as a biological
clock, are highly conserved hexameric repeats and main-
taining their length is vital for cellular longevity. Telomerase

is an important regulator of telomere length and accurate
regulation of its activity, and a correct telomere-telomerase
interaction is important to precisely safeguard telomere
length and prevent telomere attrition [44]. ODD is prominent
among the factors which can adversely affect telomere length
[45]. Rapid telomere attrition due to ODD is associated with
senescence and related disease conditions [46, 47]. Improved
telomere metabolism after YMLI seen in the study may
contribute to genomic stability. More research is needed
to explore the mechanisms of how yoga and meditation
intervention can positively modify telomere metabolism.
Our study suggests that improvement in maintenance
of balance in cellular oxidative stress (decrease in ROS and
increase in TAC) by YMLI. Supraphysiological ROS levels
are due to endogenous and exogenous factors like smoking,
excess alcohol consumption, exposure to electromagnetic
radiation, infection, xenobiotic exposure, and psychological
stress [48]. Even the levels of ROS below physiological limits
are deleterious to normal cellular function and maintaining
OS at physiological levels is important for cellular longevity.
Increased OS causes damage to all molecules, including dam-
age to DNA and telomeres. It also affects signal transduction
and gene transcription by causing genome wide hypomethy-
lation [49] and thus causes changes in the epigenome.
Regulation of cellular oxidative stress within physiological
limits after YMLI suggests the potential of this intervention in
protecting cells from OS induced DNA damage and telomere
attrition and in reversing epigenetic changes, which are accu-
mulated due to unhealthy lifestyle and adverse environmental
conditions. Other studies [50] support these findings and
have shown reduced OS upregulation of telomerase activity
and decreased ODD after YMLI. To combat OS people
use antioxidants without monitoring ROS levels resulting in
reductive stress [51] unlike in YMLI which regulates ROS
levels so that no redox sensitive physiological functions are
impaired.
Modern lifestyle and associated psychological stress have
complex interactions with lifestyle habits, environmental
conditions, and medical interventions to cause accelerated
cellular aging, which adversely affect our mental, physical,
and reproductive fitness [3‚Äì5]. Improved cellular longevity
after YMLI suggests the potential role of Yoga in pro-
moting this fitness. While psychological stress is a major
manifestation on mind contributing to increased preva-
lence of neuropsychiatric disorders including depression,
abnormal fat accumulation is a major somatic manifes-
tation contributing to increased prevalence of metabolic
syndrome and all the diseases that come under the umbrella
of metabolic syndrome including, obesity, DM, and CVD
[52]. Other peripheral manifestations of unhealthy modern
lifestyle include aging of gonads leading to infertility [53]
and recurrent pregnancy loss. Previous studies have demon-
strated the clinical benefits of Yoga and Meditation in all
these medical conditions [35]. Dada et al. have shown that
YMLI can reduce testicular aging and result in significant
upregulation in telomerase activity and decline in seminal
OS and ODD [8]. The ongoing studies in our laboratory on
the impact of Yoga and Meditation have provided significant
 6
Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevity
evidence for the reversal of cellular aging in subjects prone
to accelerated aging due to depression. Microarray (Agilent
8 √ó 60k Microarray kit) and analysis of gene expression pre-
and post-YMLI showed decreased IL6, IL10, and MAP10 and
increased IL2 and IL4 [8, 54, 55]. Improved cellular longevity
seen in our study after YMLI suggests that changes in both
cardinal and metabotrophic biomarkers of cellular aging may
be a mechanism for preventing chronic lifestyle diseases. Our
study suggests that the changes in metabotrophic factors,
which include increase in levels of ùõΩ-endorphin, BDNF, and
sirtuin-1 and decrease in levels of cortisol and IL-6, and the
cellular processes involving them, may have important roles
in reversal of cellular aging and improving cellular longevity
after YMLI.
Improvement in stress and inflammatory response in our
study after YMLI may be mediated by changes in cortisol,
ùõΩ-endorphin, IL-6, and other factors, with regulation by
changes in brain through hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
(HPA) axis. The response may involve regulation of adaptive
pathways including integrated stress response (ISR) [18],
which activate the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2
alpha (eIF2ùõº), that promote cellular recovery driving the
signaling toward cell survival and longevity. The response
may lead to decreased OS and reversal of senescent secretory
phenotype of cells, including cells in brain, adipose tissue,
endothelium, and gonads. Changes in secretory phenotype
include decreased IL-6 [56], increased BDNF, and sirtuin-1
[57]. These regulated factors may lead to balance in OS and
cellular longevity and contribute to tissue revival throughout
the body from neuroplasticity in CNS to gonads, vessels, and
muscles in the periphery. Secretory phenotype from somatic
cells provides regulatory feedback to brain [58], which com-
pletes the vicious cycle of regulation between mind and body.
Neurodegeneration is associated with pathogenesis of several
neuropsychiatric conditions and neuroplasticity has a central
role in their management and for vitality. Increased BDNF,
sirtuin-1, and ùõΩ-endorphin and decreased cortisol, which
decrease cellular aging in brain, decrease neurodegeneration
and increase neuroplasticity [23]. Increased cellular longevity
and increased neuroplasticity may be a mechanism for alter-
ation of gray matter volume in different regions of the cerebral
cortex [59], increased mindfulness [60], and several other
complex processes [55, 61] involved in reduction of stress and
depression after Yoga and Meditation. Regulated mind-body
communications may lead to minimization of subclinical
inflammation and activation of nutrition and energy sensing
pathways promoting longevity, where decrease in IL-6 and
increase in sirtuin-1 play a prominent role, respectively.
Previous studies have demonstrated increase in sirtuin-1
levels after interventions with caloric restriction [62]. Our
study is the first to document increase in sirtuin-1 levels
independent of caloric restriction after practicing Yoga. These
improved processes may result in delaying onset and slowing
down progression of diseases associated with accelerated
cellular aging.
The impact of the intervention in both genders was
assessed separately since men and women respond differently
to day to day stress [63]. Interestingly, the gender subgroup
analysis showed that reduction in cortisol and IL6 levels were
more pronounced in male than in female subjects. No signifi-
cant gender differences were seen in other biomarkers. Phase
of the menstrual cycle should be taken into consideration
since some biomarker levels are known to vary with different
phases of the menstrual cycle [64, 65]. Our study showed
significant decrease in BMI in apparently healthy subjects
which came into normal range (23.64 ¬± 3.55) from baseline
overweight range (26.30 ¬± 3.40). While latest research [66]
suggests people with mean BMI of 27, who are overweight by
current classification of obesity, are likely to survive longest
in western population, similar data is not available for Indian
population. Therefore, our findings need to be interpreted
cautiously.
Stratification of cases was not done in this study to do
subgroup analysis due to small sample size.
Lifestyle is an integrated entity, and an intervention,
like YMLI, that has overall positive influence on our health
appears most useful versus changing only one aspect at a
time, as is seen by action of certain drugs. Yoga is holistic
and a mind-body medicine and is more beneficial and advan-
tageous than individual interventions like physical exercise,
caloric restriction, and antioxidants. The practice of Yoga and
physical exercise are different entities, the former results in
energy conservation with economy of energy expenditure for
mental and physical benefits, and the later results in energy
expenditure more for physical exertions and metabolic needs,
as is evident from a study which showed exercise causes
erratic changes in biomarkers and results in OS [67] while
Meditation brings about uniform biomarker and behavioral
changes and improvement in cognition and decrease OS
[68]. Therapeutic antioxidants can only decrease ROS rather
than regulating it and may paradoxically shorten life span
[69] due to imbalance in ROS mediated immune response
[70]. YMLI regulates ROS rather than simply lowering them
by balanced stress-related processes and appropriate gene
expressions [71]. The only limitation of our study is that it
is a single arm proof of concept study and did not include
controls. It is important to adopt a lifestyle which slows the
decline in health by reversing or delaying accelerated aging
due to unhealthy lifestyle. The biomarkers of cellular aging
can form the basis for determining the risk of chronic lifestyle
diseases and the efficacy and usefulness of interventions to
decrease disease risk. Hence, findings from this study are
supportive of YMLI as a significant clinical utility especially
in prevention of and management of complex multifactorial
diseases and reducing the rate of functional decline with
aging.
5. Conclusion
Though we cannot change our biology or chronological age
we can definitely reverse/slow down the pace at which we
age by adopting YMLI. This is the first study to demonstrate
improvement in both cardinal and metabotrophic biomark-
ers of cellular aging and longevity in apparently healthy popu-
lation after Yoga and Meditation based lifestyle intervention.
So our health and the rate at which we age entirely depends
on our choices. Making Yoga and Meditation an integral part
of our lifestyle may hold the key to delay aging or aging

gracefully, prevent onset of multifactorial complex lifestyle
diseases, promote mental, physical, and reproductive health,
and prolong youthful healthy life.
