 Variation in rates of suicide in Black and minority ethnic (BME)
groups have been reported in different countries.1,2 Rates of
suicide3,4 and self-harm5–7 may be lower in BME groups than
White groups overall, but this finding may obscure differences
in age- and gender-specific groups. Also, rates of suicide and
self-harm within ethnic minority groups may fluctuate according
to area, with a decline in relative risk of suicide and self-harm
where there is a larger density of minority populations.8,9 Previous
research on BME groups in the UK has generally been conducted
in single geographical areas,10 and self-harm studies have been
limited by small sample size, with few studies of people of
African–Caribbean origin.11 A report on suicide prevention for
BME groups in England calls for better information on rates
and risk factors for suicide or behaviours that increase the
likelihood of suicide.12 We have conducted a study of self-harm
in different minority ethnic groups using a multicentre database
of self-harm in three geographical areas in England. Our objectives
were to compare ethnic groups (that is, White, South Asian and
Black African–Caribbean) with regard to: age- and gender-specific
rates of self-harm in different cities; sociodemographic and clinical
characteristics; clinical management following self-harm; and risk
of repetition of self-harm.
Method
Study design and data collection
We conducted a prospective, multicentre cohort study, identifying
all episodes of self-harm presenting to emergency departments in
general hospitals in Manchester (three hospitals), Derby (two
hospitals) and Oxford (one hospital). The study hospitals were
chosen on a pragmatic basis – the centres included were those that
had established monitoring systems. The cities of Manchester,
Derby and Oxford have different profiles (Table 1), with ethnic
groups forming a greater proportion of the general population
in Manchester. According to the UK government’s Index of
Multiple Deprivation, where 353 local authority areas in England
were scored on a number of indicators (covering a range of
economic, social and health issues) into a single deprivation
score,13 Manchester was ranked fourth (worst), Derby sixty-ninth
and Oxford one hundred and fifty-fifth.
Data were collected using established monitoring systems in
the three centres, described in full elsewhere.14,15 Self-harm
attendances
were
identified
via
detailed
examination
of
computerised
emergency
department
records
and
defined
consistently across all three centres as intentional self-poisoning
or self-injury, irrespective of motivation and degree of suicidal
intent.16 Most participants received a psychosocial assessment
from emergency department staff and/or mental health specialists.
For assessed participants, clinicians recorded a wide range of
sociodemographic
and
clinical
information
using
research
assessment forms. For participants who were not assessed (for
example, because they refused or took early discharge), basic
information was collected by research clerks from medical records.
In Manchester, data were collected for non-assessed individuals
from computerised patient record systems from September 2002
onwards. Information on ethnicity was obtained where available
and recorded either by the assessing clinician or from the hospital
patient records system, using standard UK national 2001 census
categories. We combined ethnic groups on a pragmatic basis.
Our categories were in line with previous research,17 namely:
‘South Asian’, including all people of Pakistani, Indian, or
Bangladeshi origin; ‘Black’
, including Black African–Caribbean
or Black Other; ‘White’, including White British, Irish or White
Other. We chose not to include those of ‘other ethnicity’ because
of relatively low numbers and diverse composition of this

Background
Studies of self-harm in Black and minority ethnic (BME)
groups have been restricted to single geographical areas,
with few studies of Black people.
Aims
To calculate age- and gender-specific rates of self-harm by
ethnic group in three cities and compare characteristics and
outcomes.
Method
A population-based self-harm cohort presenting to five
emergency departments in three English cities during 2001
to 2006.
Results
A total of 20 574 individuals (16–64 years) presented with
self-harm; ethnicity data were available for 75%. Rates of
self-harm were highest in young Black females (16–34 years)
in all three cities. Risk of self-harm in young South Asian
people varied between cities. Black and minority ethnic
groups were less likely to receive a psychiatric assessment
and to re-present with self-harm.
Conclusions
Despite the increased risk of self-harm in young Black
females fewer receive psychiatric care. Our findings have
implications for assessment and appropriate management for
some BME groups following self-harm.

 miscellaneous category. An upper age limit of 64 years was also
applied because of low numbers of older people who self-harmed
from ethnic minority groups.
Data were analysed for a 6-year study period for Derby and
Oxford (1 January 2001 to 31 December 2006). For Manchester,
complete data for both assessed and non-assessed individuals were
available from the 1 September 2002 and so data were analysed for
just over 4 years (ending 31 December 2006).
Statistical analyses
The analyses were carried out using Stata version 10 for Windows.
They were based on each individual’s first presentation for
self-harm during the study period. Two sets of analyses were
performed.
First, self-harm rates per 1000 person-years were calculated for
individuals aged between 16 and 64 years (this age range ensured
consistency with the age bands in the 2001 Census data)18 and
with a postcode within the city catchment area of each of
the hospitals in Manchester, Derby and Oxford. Approximate
person-years at risk were generated by multiplying the ethnic
group, gender and age-specific population estimates for each
catchment area by the applicable study period for that centre.
Incidence rate ratios (and their 95% confidence intervals) for
ethnic groups compared with White groups, city, age and gender
were
calculated
from
Poisson
regression
models,
with
no
significant evidence of overdispersion.
Second, differences between South Asian and Black people
compared with White people were explored with respect to
characteristics and clinical outcomes following the first episode
of self-harm in the study period (index episode) for all individuals
aged between 16 and 64 years who attended any of the study
hospitals with self-harm, regardless of area of their residence.
Statistical significance was assessed using chi-squared tests for
method
of
self-harm,
sociodemographic
characteristics,
precipitating factors and clinical characteristics. Analyses were
performed separately for males and females. Analysis of clinical
management outcomes (as percentages) following self-harm was
conducted using log-binomial regression to estimate risk ratios,
with variance estimates corrected for hospital clustering effects.
Finally, 12-month rates of repetition of self-harm were calculated
based on the proportion of individuals re-presenting within
12 months of index episode (excluding individuals without a full
12-month follow-up period). Log-binomial regression was used to
examine differences in the risk of repetition.
Ethical approval
Oxford and Derby both have approval from local health/
psychiatric research ethics committees to collect data on self-harm
for
local
monitoring
and
multicentre
projects.
Self-harm
monitoring in Manchester is part of a clinical audit system, and
has been ratified by the local research ethics committee. All
monitoring systems are fully compliant with the provisions of
the Data Protection Act of 1998. All centres also have approval
under Section 251 of the NHS Act 2006 (formerly section 60 of
the Health and Social Care Act 2001) regarding the use of
patient-identifiable information.
Results
During the study period there was a total of 33 314 episodes of
self-harm by 20 574 individuals aged 16 to 64 years. Ethnicity data
were available for 15 350 individuals (level of completeness overall
75%: Manchester 79%, Oxford 73% and Derby 69%). Data were
analysed for 14 997 individuals, excluding the 353 individuals of
‘other ethnicity’ from the analysis.
Rates of self-harm
Analysis of rates of self-harm was conducted for individuals of
White, Black or South Asian ethnicity (n = 8401) resident within
defined city population areas of each of the centres’ catchment
areas (Table 2). Rates of self-harm in young Black females were
highest in all three cities. The pooled rate ratio for Black females
aged 16–34 years compared with White females of the same age
group was 1.70 (95% CI 1.46–1.98). When we conducted a
conservative sensitivity analysis, ascribing all missing ethnicity
data as relating to White persons, the rate ratio (RR) was
attenuated but remained significantly elevated (RR = 1.21, 95%
CI 1.04–1.40). Combining data across the cities, there was no
difference in risk of self-harm in South Asian females aged 16–
34 years compared with White females of the same age
(RR = 0.99, 95% CI 0.87–1.11).
We tested for differences in age/gender-specific rates between
cities using a Wald chi-squared test for heterogeneity. Compared
with White people, the rate ratios in South Asian and in Black
people varied significantly by centre in young people aged 16–34
years
(in
males:
w2 = 17.9,
P= 0.001;
females:
w2 = 11.10,
P = 0.03), that is, ethnicity did not have the same risk or protective
effects in all cities. However, there was no evidence of heterogeneity
in older people aged 35–64 years of either gender (males: w2 = 3.6,
P = 0.46; females: w2 = 2.9, P= 0.57).
In comparison with White groups, there were significantly
higher rate ratios for young Black females in all three cities (Table
3). In contrast, rate ratios in young Black males did not differ
materially from those of young White males. There were lower
rate ratios in older Black people of both genders compared with
White people (Table 3), a difference that reached significance in
Manchester. There was variation in relative risk in South Asian

groups relative to White people, with significantly lower rate ratios
in young people of both genders in Derby, a lower relative risk in
males in Manchester, but no difference in either gender in Oxford.
For older South Asian people relative rates were lower than in
White people in both genders in all three cities, the differences
being significant in Manchester and Derby.
Characteristics
Analyses of sociodemographics, precipitating factors and clinical
characteristics were conducted for individuals of White, Black or
South Asian ethnicity6gender regardless of area of residence
(online Tables DS1 and DS2). In both genders, ethnic minority
groups (Black and South Asian) were younger than the White
groups, and less likely to have clinical characteristics known to
increase risk of further suicidal behaviour compared with their
White peers (that is, alcohol use within 6 h of the self-harm
episode, previous self-harm, history of psychiatric treatment).
Females
There were some differences between ethnic groups in females.
White females were more likely to present with self-injury (mostly
cutting) as a method of harm, compared with South Asian
and Black females, who were more likely to self-poison using
non-ingestible substances (mostly cleaning fluids). South Asian
females were more likely to be married and live with their
partner/husband or relatives and Black females were more likely
to be single than White females. Differences in employment status
were observed with South Asian females more likely to be
classified under household duties; Black females were more likely
to be unemployed; and females in both ethnic minority groups
were more likely to be students compared with White females.
Although problems in relationships with partner was the most
common precipitant in all groups, South Asian females were
significantly more likely to cite relationship problems with their
partner/husband and family than White females. South Asian
females and Black females were significantly less likely to report a
number of other precipitating problems than White females, apart
from housing problems, which were more common in Black
females.
Males
Significant differences in method of harm were observed between
Black and White males. They were more likely to self-injure other
than by cutting (using more violent methods of harm such
as
hanging
and
self-asphyxiation)
and
self-poison

non-ingestible substances. South Asian males were more likely to
live with a partner or relative and cite relationship problems with
their family than White males. Ethnic minority males were more
likely to be students than White males.
Clinical management and outcome
Analyses of clinical management following self-harm showed
that young Black females were less likely to receive a specialist
psychiatric assessment compared with White females (Table 4).
Ethnic minority groups of both genders were less likely to present
to the emergency departments within the study hospitals with
further self-harm (Tables 4 and 5). We fitted extra models
adjusting for age in both genders but estimates were materially
unaltered.
Females
Females in both ethnic minority groups were considerably less
likely to be referred for psychiatric out-patient or in-patient care
following self-harm compared with White females. Black females
were also less likely to be referred to their general practitioner
(GP) or receive formal follow-up arrangements.
Males
Compared with White men, following self-harm, Black males were
less likely to be referred to their GP and South Asian males were
less likely to be referred to any other service.
Discussion
Main findings
Our main result was that across all three cities young Black
females were at increased risk of self-harm. We also found
differences in clinical management, with BME groups being less
likely to receive a specialist psychiatric assessment and psychiatric
follow-up services than the White population. In addition both
minority ethnic groups in the older age range had a lower risk
in all cities, and there was a variation in rates between cities
among young South Asian males and females.
To our knowledge this is the first study to show significantly
higher rates of self-harm in young Black females across a number
of cities using large population based databases. A previous study
in the UK over 20 years ago did suggest that there may be an
elevated risk of self-harm in this group,19 although these findings
were limited by small sample size and data confined to one
hospital. A more contemporary study among people with recent
previous contact with psychiatric services showed a higher
standardised mortality ratio for suicide in Black African and
Caribbean females aged 25–39 compared with their White peers.4
Our finding of lower rates of self-harm in older males and females
in both ethnic minority groups are consistent with previous
studies.6,11 We did not find the high rates of self-harm previously
reported in young South Asian females11 across the centres in our
study.

Interpretation of findings
Several of our findings require further explanation. High rates in
some BME groups may be explained by characteristics that confer
greater vulnerability. Poor outcome may be influenced by complex
socioeconomic factors20 or may be culturally specific with
differences between age and gender groups. We lacked the
necessary explanatory variables to test these hypotheses. However,
young Black females who self-harm may be experiencing greater
social adversity, as in our cohort they were more likely to be
unemployed
and
report
housing
problems
compared
with
White women. We found that people from ethnic minority groups
were more likely to be students than their White counterparts.
Academic pressure may also have contributed to increased rates
of self-harm, especially in women.21,22 Previous studies examining
high rates of psychosis in BME groups, particularly in young
Black–Caribbeans, suggest that socioeconomic factors contribute
part of the explanation.23,24
The lower rates of self-harm in young Black males across
centres deserves further investigation. Previous studies have found
increased risk of mental illness and higher rates of completed
suicide in this group compared with the White reference group.4,25
Contemporary mainstream hip-hop epitomises ‘Black’ youth
culture and places emphasis on strength, aggression and virility.
However, stereotypical ‘manly’ behaviour may mean that young
Black males do not seek help for emotional problems. A recent
community study of suicidal behaviour in the UK provides some
support for this interpretation of our results.26 These researchers
found limited evidence of higher levels of suicidal ideation in
second-generation immigrants and that ethnic minority groups
were half as likely to seek medical attention following self-harm
compared with White groups.
In our cohort older ethnic minority people of both gen-
ders had lower rates of self-harm than their White counter-
parts in all three cities (although only significantly so in
Manchester and Derby). One explanation is that they have
lower rates per se. Another is that older BME groups may
be more reluctant to present to statutory services. In an
American study, African Americans were less likely to access
specialist mental health services compared with non-Hispanic
White people.27 Suggested reasons for a resistance to presentation
to hospital following self-harm have included that seeking help
for mental distress is considered stigmatising and socially
unacceptable, and that services were not accessible or considered
relevant.26,28
Clinical management is guided by knowledge of risk factors
from epidemiological studies in the context of an individual
patient presentation. An explanation of the less frequent specialist
psychiatric assessment received by BME groups could relate to
their ‘low risk’ clinical characteristics; for example, they were less
likely to live alone, use alcohol with the self-harm attempt and
have a previous psychiatric history or history of self-harm. Some
BME groups were slightly less likely to be subsequently referred for
formal follow-up. In addition to having apparent low-risk social
and clinical characteristics, a further explanation for low-risk
management might be related to how individuals from different
ethnic groups communicate distress. In a recent UK study on
response to childbirth, Black females had lower depression scores
than White women, despite experiencing greater social adversity.29
The ‘discourse of strength’ (a perceived ability to deal effectively
with a range of problems) attributed to young Black females
may be part of their sense of identity, and admitting to depression
therefore a sign of weakness.30 They may still actually experience
psychological distress and resort to self-harming behaviour at a
time of crisis, but this attitude of being strong may mean that
these young females do not subsequently communicate risk to
clinical staff.
The rate ratio for repetition of self-harm was significantly
lower in all ethnic minority groups compared with White groups.
This may be a result of reduced risk as they were much less likely
to have those characteristics known to increase risk of suicidal
behaviour.31 However, it may also be explained in terms of
disillusionment with statutory services. Black and minority
ethnic groups are generally perceived to have poor experiences
of mental health services.32 It is possible that on initial
presentation some ethnic minority groups may not have received
appropriate help, which may have affected their willingness to
re-present.33,34
Previous studies have found an increased risk of self-harm in
young South Asian females compared with White women.11 We
did not find this. There are a number of possible interpretations
for the difference in results in young South Asian groups
compared with previous findings and between centres. First,
previous studies were carried out in Birmingham and London17,35
and not all South Asian populations are the same. For example
within our three centres the proportions of the population that
were
of
Indian,
Pakistani
and
Bangladeshi
origin
varied
considerably (Table 1). Our results might therefore reflect the
particular mix of South Asian populations in the three centres.
Second, comparative studies took place over 10–25 years ago
and the young British South Asian population is likely to have
changed over time.36 Third, since these findings, considerable
attention has been drawn to this problem, with consequent
improvement of services.37,38
The higher rate ratios observed in young South Asian people
compared with young White people in Oxford in relation to the
other cities might be a result of differences in the relative
socioeconomic profiles between ethnic groups in different cities.
Differences in the relative density of ethnic groups between cities
may also explain this variation in rates. Oxford has the lowest
proportion of South Asian people within its population compared
with the other cities, although it had higher rates of self-harm in
South Asian young males and females compared with their White
counterparts. This could reflect the cultural incongruence and
ecological-effect modification suggested in previous research – a
negative correlation between the incidence of psychological
distress and the size of an ethnic group relative to the total
population.8,39 Unfortunately, we had no measure of these
contextual variables to enable examination of their potential
effects.
Strengths and limitations
The strength of this study is that we used large, contemporary
population-based databases from three separate centres and
examined the three main ethnic groups living in the UK. The data
were collected principally from urban populations and this might
limit the generalisability of the findings, although the populations
covered by
the
three centres
had
different
socioeconomic
characteristics.14 The ethnic minority categories we applied were
broad and did not take account of cultural identity.40 However,
it enabled estimation of precise rates and relative risks stratified
by age and gender and allowed direct comparison with previous
research on ethnic groups in the UK. This may have concealed
differences between ethnic groups within the categories we used.
All three centres may have overassigned people to ethnic minority
groups compared with Office for National Statistics ascertainment
procedures. Ethnicity was recorded by healthcare staff who may or
may not have asked the individual to categorise themselves.
Ethnicity was recorded for 75% of individuals. Ethnicity is not
216
 Self-harm and ethnicity
recorded comprehensively in hospital settings, although our
capture rate was significantly higher than a recent survey of users
of community mental health services in England.33 Even so, there
is the potential for selection bias. However, when we conducted a
conservative sensitivity analysis on rates of self-harm on White
versus Black females aged 16 to 34 years ascribing all missing data
to the White groups the conclusion was essentially unchanged.
Implications for services and further research
Those designing services for people who self-harm need to be
aware of the different levels of risk of self-harm and the variations
in risk characteristics in different ethnic groups. Services also
should be able to respond to the varied needs within these groups.
It may be that a failure of professionals to recognise cultural
factors at play, and an ignorance of available services, contribute
to the lack of recognition of mental health problems and
subsequent failure to offer (and for ethnic minority patients to
engage in) further services. The challenge is to make services more
culturally sensitive. There is some evidence for effectiveness of
cultural competency training in demonstrating a change in skills
and attitudes of clinicians.41 Future culturally sensitive studies
might help us achieve a greater understanding of the suicidal
process in ethnic minority groups.

My taster experience
Sacha Evans
A business man who thought the CIA were ‘after him’, a recovering cocaine addict with financial problems and a young man refusing
to engage with any treatment were some of the memorable patients I met during my taster session. In a single ward round,
I managed to ‘tick-off’ schizophrenia, bipolar affective and borderline personality disorders. For psychiatrists, seeing these types
of patient is routine; for foundation doctors, our exposure may be limited to our student attachments.
Following on from Modernising Medical Careers, foundation doctors are expected to make their career choice approximately
16 months after graduating. With only 6% of graduates being offered a psychiatry post during their foundation training, few get direct
psychiatry experience. To overcome this, the UK Foundation Programme Office recommends that foundation doctors undertake
taster sessions, which is 3 to 5 days’ work experience under the guidance of a senior clinician.
My consultant had a well-planned schedule; in 3 days, I managed to fit in a community visit, clinical governance session and audit
presentation. I also gained valuable clinical contact on the ward. I became aware of some pertinent issues in psychiatric practice,
such as patients’ physical health and the use of crisis resolution teams and emergency psychiatric services. It gave me the
opportunity to speak to trainees (at different stages of training) to gain their perspectives about a career in psychiatry and find
out the all-important tips for success in the application process.
There are challenges; tasters can be difficult to arrange. Before I started, I had to organise two references, visit the human resources
department and get a separate Criminal Records Bureau check. The short duration provides a snapshot, rather than the full
spectrum of career opportunities in psychiatry. It also relies on having an enthusiastic and proactive sponsor. My experience was
overwhelmingly positive and reinforced my belief that psychiatry is the career for me.
For more information about organising tasters see the Foundation Programme Reference Guide Appendix F: Embedded taster
experiences template (downloads available from http://www.foundationprogramme.nhs.uk/pages/home/key-documents).
