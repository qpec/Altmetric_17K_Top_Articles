Abstract
The accident at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant occurred after the Great East Japan Earthquake on 11 March 2011, releasing a large amount of
radioactive materials into the atmosphere. Questions were raised regarding the health effects of radiation exposure, which led to increased anxiety among the
Fukushima residents about the possible development of thyroid cancer. Thus, thyroid ultrasound examinations began for those who were from the areas where
the radiation doses were highest, and will continue for the long term. In total, 300 476 subjects aged 18 years or younger at the time of the disaster were
screened from 9 October 2011 to 31 March 2014. The participation rate was 81.7% of the total population of this age and in the affected area. Among them, the
proportions of those who fell into the categories A1 (no nodules or cysts present), A2 (nodule � 5 mm or cyst � 20 mm diameter), B (nodule > 5 mm or
cyst > 20 mm diameter) and C (immediate need for further investigation) were 51.5, 47.8, 0.8 and 0%, respectively; 2294 subjects in categories B and C were
recommended to undergo a confirmatory examination; 113 were subsequently diagnosed with malignancy or suspected malignancy by fine needle aspiration
cytology. The full-scale survey (second round survey) began in April 2014, and was completed by 30 June 2015, and comprised 169 455 subjects (participation
rate; 44.7%). The proportions of those who fell into the categories A1, A2, B and C were 41.6, 57.6, 0.8 and 0% (no case), respectively; 1223 subjects in category B
were recommended to undergo a confirmatory examination, 25 of these were subsequently diagnosed with malignancy or suspected malignancy by fine needle
aspiration cytology. The thyroid cancers identified in this survey so far are unlikely to be due to radiation exposure, and are more likely to be the result of
screening using highly sophisticated ultrasound techniques. However, it would be advisable to continue long-term screening to determine whether the risk of
childhood and adolescent thyroid cancer due to radiation exposure increases or not.

Introduction
The
accident
at
Tokyo
Electric
Power
Company’s
Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) occurred
after the Great East Japan Earthquake on 11 March 2011,
releasing a large amount of radioactive materials into the
atmosphere.
In terms of severity, the accident at the Fukushima
Daiichi NPP was rated at level 7 on the International Nuclear
and Radiological Event Scale [1], which matches the rating
to the Chernobyl NPP accident in 1986. Between 4 and 5
years after the Chernobyl accident, childhood thyroid car-
cinoma in Belarus and Ukraine was shown to have increased
as a consequence of prolonged exposure to radioactive
iodine fallout, mainly through intake of food and cows’ milk
[2e5]. This appearance was the only significant effect of the
radiation exposure after the Chernobyl accident on the
health of the exposed residents. This late nuclear accident-
related increase in childhood thyroid cancer caused great
worry among the Japanese public in the first few months
after the Fukushima disaster. This concern persisted even

 after realisation that the radiation exposure dose was very
low compared with the dose resulting from the Chernobyl
disaster [1,6e9].
Questions were raised regarding the health effects of
radiation exposure, which led to increased anxiety among
the Fukushima residents about the possible development of
thyroid cancer. Due to these concerns and a strong request
from central and local governments, the Fukushima Health
Management Survey (FHMS) initiated several health pro-
tection surveys, including one that involved thyroid ultra-
sound examinations (TUE) of all child and adolescent
inhabitants either resident in or visiting Fukushima at the
time of the accident. The first aim of this survey was to
evaluate the baseline rates of childhood thyroid nodules
and cancer in Fukushima, because there was no epidemio-
logical data, especially using ultrasonography, from children
and adolescents before the accident, except in a few pre-
fectures [10e15].
Thus, the baseline survey of TUE began on 9 October 2011
conducted by Fukushima Medical University in those areas
where the radiation doses were relatively higher and will
continue for a number of years [10e15].
This overview summarises the progress of the TUE, the
challenges in carrying out this screening project and gives
details of the thyroid cancers that have been identified
during the last 5 years. It will also comment on the risk of
thyroid cancer after the Fukushima accident.
Thyroid Ultrasound Screening of the
Fukushima Health Management Survey
Schedule
The schedule was divided into two: the preliminary
baseline survey (PBLS) and the full-scale survey (FSS). If
radiation-induced thyroid cancer occurs in Fukushima, the
latency would be expected to be at least 4 or 5 years, based
on previous data from radiation exposure (from the Cher-
nobyl accident, the atomic bombs in Hiroshima and Naga-
saki, and radiotherapy to the neck). The FSS data could then
be compared with data from the PBLS in order to determine
any increase in thyroid cancer over time. The present
investigation was designed as a cohort study. The PBLS was
also divided into three schedules in different regions of the
affected area. The first survey began in the financial year
2011 in the 13 evacuation zone municipalities around the
Fukushima Daiichi NPP that represent the area with the
highest spatial radiation dose immediately after the acci-
dent. The second survey was carried out in financial year
2012 in those areas with intermediate levels of radioactive
contamination. The third survey was carried out in financial
year 2013 in the lowest level of radioactivity (Figure 1a).
The FSS, second round survey, was also divided into two
surveys. The first survey was carried out in financial year
2014 in areas with high levels of contamination and in some
areas with intermediate levels. The second survey will
follow in the remaining areas with intermediate levels of
contamination
and
also
in
areas
with
low
level
contamination (Figure 1b). The FSS will then be repeated
every 2 years for each subject until the age of 20 years, then
every 5 years thereafter for the remainder of each subject’s
life. TUE was carried out first on those who were living in
those areas of highest exposure at the time of the accident
(Figure 1c) [10e14].
Diagnostic Criteria of the First Screening of Thyroid
Ultrasound
The primary examination aimed at detecting nodules or
cysts by ultrasonography [12,13] and used a classification
system, divided into three categories. Those in category A
were recommended to undergo another primary examina-
tion. This category was also further divided into two cate-
gories, A1 for those without nodules or cysts, A2 for those
with nodules smaller than 5.0 mm and/or cysts smaller than
20 mm. Category B included those with nodules larger than
5.1 mm and/or cysts larger than 20.1 mm, who were then
recommended to undergo a confirmatory examination.
Category C subjects required immediate examination due to
a finding of a large or suspicious thyroid tumour/lymph
node. Mixed cystic-solid nodules are considered as ‘nod-
ules’. Some A2 category results may be reclassified as B after
clinical examination.
Diagnostic Criteria of Confirmatory Examination
Where subjects were categorised as B or C, further tests
were carried out. These comprised ultrasound and blood
and urine tests followed by fine needle aspiration cytology
(FNAC), according to the guidelines issued by the Japan
Association
of
Breast
and
Thyroid
Sonology
(JABTS)
(Figure 2) [16] and the Japan Society of Ultrasound Medicine
(JSUM) (Table 1) [17].
According to guidelines of the JABTS and JSUM, FNAC is
recommended for nodules more than 5 mm in diameter, if
strongly suspicious for thyroid carcinoma from JSUM diag-
nostic criteria (Table 2); those larger than 10 mm in diam-
eter and suspicious for carcinoma from the above criteria;
all nodules over 20 mm in diameter; and all cystic lesions
larger than 20 mm in diameter (Figure 2). These guidelines
were followed to avoid unnecessary FNAC, especially for
nodules larger than 5 mm but smaller than 10 mm.
If a benign lesion was detected, by either ultrasonogra-
phy only or by ultrasonography and FNAC, the subjects were
recommended to undergo a follow-up treatment under Ja-
pan’s comprehensive medical coverage programme.
If a malignancy was suspected or detected by FNAC, the
subject would require surgical treatment.

 screened from 9 October 2011 to 31 March 2014. Among
them, the proportions of those who fell into each of the
categories A1, A2, B and C were 51.5, 47.8, 0.8 and 0% (one
person), respectively; 2294 subjects in categories B and C
were recommended to undergo a confirmatory examina-
tion; 113 were subsequently diagnosed with malignancy or
suspected malignancy by FNAC.
Full-scale Survey
The first time FSS, second round TUE survey of 169 455
subjects (participation rate; 44.7%) started in April 2014 and
results had been received by 30 June 2015. The proportions
of those who were classified as categories A1, A2, B and C
were 41.6, 57.6, 0.8 and 0% (no case), respectively; 1223
subjects classified as category B were recommended to
undergo a confirmatory examination. Of these, 25 subjects
were diagnosed with malignancy or suspected malignancy
by FNAC.
Age and Gender Distribution of Malignancy or Suspected
Malignancy by Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology (Table 3,
Figure 3)
In the PBLS, the mean age at diagnosis and at the time of
disaster was 17.3 and 14.8 years, respectively; of these, 38
were male and 75 were female. There was no case aged
younger than 6 years at the time of the accident. These
results are similar to the results reported by Tronko et al. [5]
in the first 4 years after the Chernobyl accident. It is inter-
esting to note that the age distribution changed dramati-
cally in Ukraine more than 4 years after the accident, with
increasing numbers of thyroid cancers in those aged
younger than 6 years at the time of the Chernobyl accident
[5].
In the FSS, the mean age at diagnosis and at the time of
the disaster was 17 and 9 years old; 11 were male and 14
were female; 4 years after the accident there were still no
cases aged younger than 6 years at the time of the accident.

 Surgical Treatment of Thyroid Cancer
Of the 113 subjects diagnosed with or suspicious for
cancer in the PBLS, 99 subjects have already undergone
surgery. Papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) was confirmed in 95
cases and there were three cases of poorly differentiated
thyroid carcinoma (PDTC) and one case in which the thyroid
tumour was benign.
Of the 25 subjects diagnosed with or suspected for can-
cer in the FSS, six subjects have already undergone surgery;
all were confirmed as PTC after surgery (Table 3) [18]. Most
of these patients were operated in the Fukushima Medical
University Hospital by specialists certified by the Japan
Society of Thyroid Surgery (JSTS) and the Japan Association
of Endocrine Surgeons (JAES) according to Japanese guide-
lines for the treatment of thyroid tumour by JAES and JSTS
[19]. Confirmed results after FNAC were discussed in detail

surveillance or surgery. Cases were reviewed by a panel of
thyroid experts both pre- and postoperatively.
Thyroid Cancer Prevalence and Radiation
Dose in Fukushima Prefecture
Suspicious or Malignant Cases on Fine Needle Aspiration
Cytology by Estimated Radiation Dose
In the PBLS, among 113 cases diagnosed with malignancy
or suspected malignancy on FNAC, 65 cases (57.5%) were
also participants in the basic survey of the FHMS, which
estimated individual external radiation dose. Of these, 45
(71.4%) had estimated radiation exposure doses below
1 mSv; the highest effective dose was 2.2 mSv.
There was no significant difference in the individual
effective dose between these 113 cases and the other par-
ticipants in the TUE [18].

 higher (Figure 1) [12]. Although these three areas were
different in the level of radiation exposure, there was no
significant difference in the proportion of suspicious or
malignant cases on FNAC among these three areas (Table 2)
[12]. Area 3 was also divided into Iwaki, Soma and Aizu, so
the prevalence of diagnosed or suspected thyroid cancer
was estimated in four geographical areas: the evacuation
zone (1.1% exposed to 5 mSv or more), Nakadori (0.007%
exposed to 5 mSv or more), Iwaki and Soma (0.004%
exposed to 5 mSv or more) and Aizu (0% exposed to 5 mSv
or more). There was no significant differences in thyroid
cancer prevalence among the evacuation zone (33.5 per
100 000), Iwaki and Soma (43.0 per 100 000), Nakadori
(37.2 per 100 000) and the reference area of Aizu (32.6 per
100 000), which had the lowest radiation level [13].
Genetic Alterations
In 68 patients where surgery had been carried out, thyroid
tumour tissue was examined for the presence of driver mu-
tations to clarify the pathogenesis of the tumour. BRAFV600E
was identified in 43 cases (63.2%), RET/PTC1 in six (8.8%), RET/
PTC3 in one (1.5%) and ETV6/NTRK3 in four (5.9%) [20].
Other Findings from Thyroid Ultrasound
Screening
Ectopic Intrathyroidal Thymus
Ectopic intrathyroidal thymus (EITT) is thought to be a
rare entity, but about 1% of the children had an EITT
identified as a result of the large-scale screening carried out
as part of the larger FHMS. Diagnostic criteria are based on
the ultrasonographic appearance of EITT; round, oval, or
polygonal hypoechoic or hyperechoic areas, with multiple
granular and punctate echogenic foci (Figure 4A, 4B) [21].
The mean age was 7.0 years (range 0e18 years). There was
no difference in the laterality of EITT. The incidence of EITT
was inversely correlated with age and body mass index.
In the 10e14 age group, girls had higher odds ratio (0.46;
confidence interval 0.27e0.78; P ¼ 0.004) of decreasing
prevalence of EITT. In addition, higher body mass index
(odds ratio ¼ 0.90; confidence interval 0.83e0.98; P ¼ 0.02)
was associated with a lower prevalence [21].
Colloid Cyst
Category A2 consisted most of cysts, especially small
multiple colloid cysts, cysts with colloid clot (Figure 4C)
[12]. These were characterised on ultrasound as a comet tail
sign or cat’s eye sign (Figure 4D). These colloid cysts are
easily detected by ultrasound even when very small
(1e3 mm). These findings are benign and it was therefore
not necessary to do a further examination such as FNAC
[12].
Thyroid Volume
The aim of the PBLS was to establish updated reference
values for thyroid volume by ultrasound examination and
epidemiological analysis in 0e19-year-old Japanese chil-
dren. The subjects were 38 063 children who were exam-
ined by ultrasonography as the first PBLS of the FHMS

 between 9 October 2011 and 31 March 2012. The width,
thickness and height of each lobe were measured and the
volume of each lobe was calculated by the mean of the
elliptical shape volume formula. Positive correlation was
observed between thyroid volume and either age or body
surface. The right lobe was significantly larger than the left
lobe. The thyroid volume in females was larger than that in
males after adjusting body surface area [22].
Discussion
The development of a comprehensive thyroid screening
programme after the Fukushima accident has raised a
number of issues. There were differing opinions on when
the TUE should start and how frequently the children
should be screened thereafter, and there are a number of
considerations to be taken into account before agreeing the
protocol for such a study.
Some parents wanted to carry out the TUE at shorter
intervals e every year, every 6 or 3 months, rather than
every 2 years. Some suggested that the TUE should be made
‘on demand’, i.e. anytime, anywhere in the neighbourhood.
The reports of the primary examination of TUE were pro-
vided by post. Some parents requested a more detailed
explanation of the results for their children. Several
guardians would have liked to receive pictures of the ul-
trasound image for their child.
As the results of the study were made public, a number of
other issues came to light. The first survey of the PBLS
suggested a high frequency of subjects categorised as A2
(47.6%) in Fukushima. Most of the subjects classified as
category A2 had cysts. This was regarded as an unexpected
finding in Japan and elsewhere, and was initially inter-
preted as being a result of radiation exposure.
To
obtain
comparative
data
for
increasing
A2
in
Fukushima, the Ministry of Environment entrusted the
JABTS to carry out thyroid examinations using the same
method used in Fukushima Prefecture among three pre-
fectures, Aomori, Yamanashi and Nagasaki, which were
geographically distant from Fukushima and not exposed to
radiation from the accident. The same protocol as for the
Fukushima TUE was used to study children aged between 3
and 18 years old in these three prefectures. The results
showed that the frequency of those classified as A2 (56.6%)
in the three prefectures was higher than that in Fukushima
[23,24]. This indicated that the increased finding of thyroid
cysts that comprised most of those cases classified as A2
depended on the precision of the screening rather than
being related to radiation exposure.
The participation rate of those in the age group 16e18
years (at the time of the accident) in target municipalities
for financial years 2011, 2012, 2013 in the PBLS were 74.1,
62.9, 36.2%, respectively [18]. The decrease in participation
in this age group is even more marked in the FSS. The
participation rate of age group 18e21 years (as of the date of
primary examination) in target municipalities for financial
year 2014 was 22.3%, the lowest of all the age groups [18].
The reasons for this decline in participation are probably
changes in lifestyle with those older than 18 years moving
away from the area for work or education and therefore it
becomes more difficult to attend a clinic held during the
week. We have therefore started providing venues for
screening outside of the Fukushima area and provide
additional opportunities to be screened either at the
weekend or during seasonal holidays. In the younger age
groups,
parental/guardian
pressure
probably
enforces
attendance at the screening clinics.
The PBLS was completed with a high participation rate
(81.7%) and the FSS, the second round screening, has
already started. As a result, 113 and 25 subjects were diag-
nosed with a malignancy or suspected malignancy by FNAC
in the two phases, respectively; 98 and six cases have
already undergone surgery and been confirmed as thyroid
cancer [18]. These results could be interpreted that in
Fukushima, thyroid cancer in children and adolescents was
increasing compared with before the accident. Does this
really mean that these cases of thyroid cancer were a result
of radiation exposure after the Fukushima Daiichi NPP ac-
cident? Our tentative answer is ‘no’. The reasons from data
obtained from the PBLS are as follows.
� Radiation doses in Fukushima were extremely low. Most
of the target population for the TUE received doses
below 1 mSv [18] and although it is difficult to measure
the dose due to 131-I accurately because of its short
physical half-life, further studies using whole body
counters in 22 717 residents suggested that 99.9% had
received doses of less than 1 mSv/year [12,13]. Initial
estimations using the System for the Prediction of
Environmental Emergency Dose (SPEEDI) assumed a
continuous radiation intake from 12 to 24 March 2011
and suggested that the thyroid equivalent dose in a 1-
year-old child in Iwaki city, Kawamata town and Iitate
village might have reached 100 mSv. However, direct
thyroid measurements of 1080 children in these three
areas showed that none of the children had a level of 0.2
microSv/h (equivalent to 100 mSv). Instead the highest
level recorded was 0.1 microSv/h (equivalent to 35 mSv)
[8,25e27]. This compares with the estimated mean
doses of 500 mGy (range 50e5000 mGy) for thyroid
doses in those evacuated after Chernobyl. In Fukushima,
the individual thyroid doses are unlikely to be above the
recommended
level
for
intervention
of
50
mSv
[2,6,8,9,12e14,25e28].
� The expected latency for radiation-induced thyroid
cancer is 4e5 years [2e5]; only 4 years have passed
since the Fukushima accident.
� The carcinogenic risk would be heightened if the sub-
jects were young at the time of the accident, but the
average age of these malignant or suspected malignant
cases was 15 years old and the youngest age group (0e5
years) has shown no occurrence of cancer to date [2e5].
� There was no difference in the thyroid cancer discovery
rate within the 4 year period.
� Unlike Chernobyl, most cases were diagnosed with
classical type PTC, and there were no solid variant PTCs,
which were typically shown in the radiation-induced

 thyroid cancer after the Chernobyl accident [2e4,29].
The results of the FSS study were similar to those of the
PBLS study.
For the FSS, the mean age was the same; tumour size was
smaller, fewer tumours were identified compared with the
PBLS (Table 3).
The FSS results showed a similar pattern to the PBLS with
respect to age and gender, and those diagnosed with ma-
lignancy and suspected malignancy by FNAC. There were no
cases in children aged 0e5 years old.
The results from the PBLS show that 25 participants with
malignancy or suspected malignancy were categorised as
A1 (10), A2 (13), and B (2). Among 25 cases, 23 cases (92%)
were A1/A2 in the PBLS. This shows that most of these 25
subjects were detected for the first time in the FSS by ul-
trasonography [18]. Although ultrasound examination can
easily detect even a 1 mm cyst, malignant solid tumour
without a cystic component might be unable to be detected
within 5 mm by ultrasound. Therefore TUE should be car-
ried out repeatedly every 2 years.
If, however, the thyroid cancers detected are not the
result of radiation exposure, we should be concerned about
the effects of overdiagnosis as a result of the screening
programme. In some countries, particularly in the USA and
Korea, the rate of thyroid cancer has been shown to be
increasing since 2000 [30,31]. Some of this increase is due
to better diagnosis, as evidenced by the numbers of micro-
PTC. We have therefore been careful in the TUE to recom-
mend that tumours below 5 mm diameter should not pro-
ceed directly to surgery, in accordance with local guidance
in Japan from JABTS, JSUM, JSTS, Japan Thyroid Association
and JAES [32].
Unfortunately, a comparison between the frequency of
thyroid cancer identified by sensitive screening pro-
cedures used in the TUE and statistics based on operations
are made by less knowledgeable scientists. This has led to
misrepresentation of the initial findings of the TUE in
both the scientific media and the press. The subsequent
surveys that will be carried out as part of the TUE should
increase our understanding of thyroid cancer in a young
population and will provide an opportunity to evaluate
any effect of radiation exposure on thyroid cancer in this
population.
