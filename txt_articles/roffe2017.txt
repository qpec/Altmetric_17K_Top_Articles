IMPORTANCE Hypoxia is common in the first few days after acute stroke, is frequently
intermittent, and is often undetected. Oxygen supplementation could prevent hypoxia and
secondary neurological deterioration and thus has the potential to improve recovery.
OBJECTIVE To assess whether routine prophylactic low-dose oxygen therapy was more
effective than control oxygen administration in reducing death and disability at 90 days, and
if so, whether oxygen given at night only, when hypoxia is most frequent, and oxygen
administration is least likely to interfere with rehabilitation, was more effective than
continuous supplementation.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this single-blind randomized clinical trial, 8003 adults
with acute stroke were enrolled from 136 participating centers in the United Kingdom within
24 hours of hospital admission if they had no clear indications for or contraindications to
oxygen treatment (first patient enrolled April 24, 2008; last follow-up January 27, 2015).
INTERVENTIONS Participants were randomized 1:1:1 to continuous oxygen for 72 hours
(n = 2668), nocturnal oxygen (21:00 to 07:00 hours) for 3 nights (n = 2667), or control
(oxygen only if clinically indicated; n = 2668). Oxygen was given via nasal tubes at 3 L/min if
baseline oxygen saturation was 93% or less and at 2 L/min if oxygen saturation was greater
than 93%.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was reported using the modified
Rankin Scale score (disability range, 0 [no symptoms] to 6 [death]; minimum clinically
important difference, 1 point), assessed at 90 days by postal questionnaire (participant
aware, assessor blinded). The modified Rankin Scale score was analyzed by ordinal logistic
regression, which yields a common odds ratio (OR) for a change from one disability level
to the next better (lower) level; OR greater than 1.00 indicates improvement.
RESULTS A total of 8003 patients (4398 (55%) men; mean [SD] age, 72 [13] years; median
National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, 5; mean baseline oxygen saturation, 96.6%)
were enrolled. The primary outcome was available for 7677 (96%) participants. The
unadjusted OR for a better outcome (calculated via ordinal logistic regression) was 0.97
(95% CI, 0.89 to 1.05; P = .47) for oxygen vs control, and the OR was 1.03 (95% CI, 0.93 to
1.13; P = .61) for continuous vs nocturnal oxygen. No subgroup could be identified that
benefited from oxygen. At least 1 serious adverse event occurred in 348 (13.0%) participants
in the continuous oxygen group, 294 (11.0%) in the nocturnal group, and 322 (12.1%) in the
control group. No significant harms were identified.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among nonhypoxic patients with acute stroke, the
prophylactic use of low-dose oxygen supplementation did not reduce death or disability
at 3 months. These findings do not support low-dose oxygen in this setting.

 H
ypoxia is common during the first days after an acute
stroke1 and associated with higher rates of neurologi-
cal deterioration,2 death and institutionalization,3 and
greater mortality.4 While cells in the ischemic penumbra are
onlyviableforafewhours,braincellsbeyondtheischemiccore
and penumbra remain at risk of delayed cell death for several
days owing to vasogenic edema, inflammation, and pro-
grammed cell death, particularly if metabolic disturbances are
compounded by hypoxia.5-7 Continuous monitoring is asso-
ciated with better outcomes,8 but even in intensively moni-
tored patients, hypoxia is not always identified and treated.
Adverse outcomes were observed to be increased when only
some desaturations of less than 90% were treated with oxy-
gen and reduced when all were treated.3
Supplemental oxygen could improve outcomes by pre-
venting hypoxia and secondary brain damage but could also
have adverse effects.9 These include vasoconstriction and pul-
monary toxicity with high concentrations,9 respiratory tract
infection due to contamination of the nasal tubes, the tubing
acting as an impediment to mobilization, stress, and the di-
rect effects of oxygen on vascular tone and blood pressure.10
Three small trials of short-term (≤12 hours) high-flow (10 to
45L/min)therapeuticoxygen,aimedatgeneratingsupraphysi-
ological blood oxygen levels, have not shown improved
outcomes.11-13 A larger trial (n = 550) using low-dose supple-
mental oxygen (3 L/min for 24 hours) also showed no benefit,14
but early neurological recovery was improved in a study giv-
ing low-dose oxygen over 72 hours.15
The primary aim of the Stroke Oxygen Study (SO2S) was
todeterminewhetherlow-doseoxygentherapyduringthefirst
3 days after an acute stroke improves outcome compared with
usual care (oxygen only when needed). Because oxygen may
restrict mobility and interfere with daytime activities, the sec-
ondary hypothesis was that oxygen given at night only, when
hypoxia is most likely, is more effective than continuous oxy-
gen supplementation.
Methods
Study Design
Thiswasamulticenterrandomizedclinicaltrialofoxygensupple-
mentationwithsingle-blindoutcomeassessment.Theprotocol
andstatisticalanalysisplan(Supplement1andSupplement2),16,17
and data collection forms18 are published. Fully informed writ-
ten or witnessed oral consent was given by the participants or,
if they did not have capacity to consent, by a legal representa-
tive. The protocol was approved by the North Staffordshire
Research Ethics Committee (06/Q2604/109).
Participants
Adults (aged ≥18 years) with a clinical diagnosis of acute stroke
within 24 hours of hospital admission (136 participating cen-
ters in the United Kingdom), who had no clinical indications
for or contraindications to oxygen treatment or any concomi-
tant condition likely to limit life expectancy to less than 12
months were eligible (see eAppendix in Supplement 3 for defi-
nition of acute stroke).
Randomization and Interventions
Participantswereallocated1:1:1viacentralweb-basedminimized
randomization19 to (1) continuous oxygen supplementation;
(2)nocturnaloxygensupplementationonly;or(3)noroutineoxy-
gen(control).Thefactorsforwhichimbalanceswereminimized
were the Six Simple Variable prognostic index for independent
survivalat6months20(cutoffs:≤0.1,>0.1to≤0.35,>0.35to≤0.70,
>0.70), oxygen treatment before randomization (yes, no, un-
known),baselineoxygensaturationonair(<95%,≥95%),andtime
sincestrokeonset(cutoffs:≤3,>3to≤6,>6to≤12,>12to≤24,>24
hours). Stroke onset was defined as the last time well for wake-
upstrokes.Noblockingwasused.Oxygenwasadministeredper
nasal tubes either continuously (day and night) during the first
72hoursafterrandomizationorovernight(21:00hoursto07:00
hours) for 3 nights. Oxygen was given at a flow rate of 3 L/min if
baselinesaturationwas93%orbeloworataflowrateof2L/min
ifbaselinesaturationwasgreaterthan93%.Inthecontrolgroup,
no routine oxygen supplementation was given.
Vital signs were observed at least 4 times per day, with any
abnormalfindingstreatedindependentlyoftrialallocation.Pa-
tientsrequiringoxygeninthecontrolgroup,patientsinthenoc-
turnal oxygen group during the day, or patients needing
changes in oxygen dosage for clinical reasons were given the
appropriate concentration of oxygen irrespective of treat-
ment group. In addition, for 4144 patients recruited in the lat-
ter half of the study, spot checks of treatment adherence were
undertaken at midnight and 6 AM.
Outcomes and Blinding
Outcomes were assessed at 1 week by a member of the local re-
search team and at 90 days via postal questionnaire. Tele-
phone interviews were conducted with nonresponders or to
clarify unclear or missing answers. The primary outcome was
themodifiedRankinScale(mRS) 21score(disabilityrange,0[no
symptoms] to 6 [death]; minimum clinically important differ-
ence 1 point) assessed at 90 days. Secondary outcomes were
numberofparticipantswithneurologicalimprovement(≥4-point
decrease on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale
[NIHSS])22,23 between randomization and day 7, the highest
andlowestoxygensaturationswithinthefirst72hours,andmor-
tality at 1 week. Further secondary outcomes at 90 days were
mortality, number of participants alive and independent
(mRS ≤2), number of participants living at home, Barthel Index
Key Points
Question Does routine prophylactic low-dose oxygen
supplementation after acute stroke improve functional outcome?
Findings In this randomized clinical trial, 8003 patients with
acute stroke were randomized within 24 hours of admission
to 3 days of continuous oxygen, nocturnal oxygen, or control.
After 3 months, there was no significant difference in death and
disability for the combined oxygen groups compared with control
(odds ratio, 0.97) or for the continuous oxygen group compared
with the nocturnal oxygen group (odds ratio, 1.03).
Meaning Routine low-dose oxygen did not improve outcomes
in nonhypoxic patients after acute stroke.

Statistical Analysis
Thetrialwasdesignedtoanswer2keyquestions:whetheroxy-
gen supplementation improves outcome (mRS at 90 days) and
whether giving oxygen at night is more effective than giving
it continuously. The main comparisons, therefore, were of the
2 combined oxygen groups (continuous and nocturnal only)
vscontrol,andofcontinuousoxygenvsnocturnal-onlyoxygen.
The statistical analysis plan describes the analysis methods in
detail (Supplement 1 and Supplement 2).17
ThemRSwasanalyzedbyordinallogisticregression,which
yields a common odds ratio (OR) for a move from one level to
the next better (lower) level with an OR more than 1.00 indicat-
inganimprovement.Forthisandotheroutcomevariables,apri-
mary unadjusted analysis and a secondary covariate-adjusted
analysis were performed. Adjusted analyses incorporated the
following covariates: age, sex, baseline NIHSS score, baseline
oxygensaturation,andtheSixSimpleVariableprognosticindex
for 6-month independence (or for analysis of mortality, the Six
SimpleVariableprognosticindexfor30-daysurvival).Sensitiv-
ityanalysisforthemRSusedmultipleimputationofmissingval-
ues (using a chained equations method with 20 imputed data
sets). Additional imputations were performed to allow for the
possibilitythatdataweremissingnotatrandomandwereeither
better or worse than expected; missing values were thereby re-
placed by either very good (ie, lowest) or very poor (ie, highest)
scores on the mRS as appropriate (eTable 3 in Supplement 3).
Subgroups, for the mRS only, were analyzed by an interaction
term and were predefined in the statistical analysis plan.17

Treatment Adherence
Adherence was similar in the continuous oxygen group (2158
[81%]) and the nocturnal oxygen group (2225 [83%]), all of
whom were prescribed the full course of treatment (eTable 2
in Supplement 3). Use of oxygen was discontinued prema-
turely among 433 (16%) participants in the continuous oxy-
gen group and 361 (14%) in the nocturnal oxygen group. The
most common reason for early discontinuation of oxygen was
discharge from the hospital. In the control group, trial oxy-
gen was recorded as being given to 33 (1.2%) participants, with
no recording of whether oxygen was given among 406 (15%).

Subgroupanalysis(Figure3)foundnoindicationthattreat-
ment effectiveness differed in any of the predefined sub-
groups, even those in whom most benefit might be expected
such as patients with more severe stroke or those for whom
oxygen supplementation was started early after stroke onset.
Secondary Outcomes
Analyses of secondary outcomes also showed no benefit from
oxygen (Table 2). Neurological impairment at 1 week im-
proved from baseline to the same degree in all 3 groups with
median NIHSS scores of 2 (IQR, 1 to 6) by 1 week. Oxygen treat-
ment did not increase the number of participants who were
alive and independent or back in their home, the ability to per-
form basic (Barthel Index) or extended (Nottingham Ex-
tended Activities of Daily Living) activities of daily living, or
quality of life (EuroQol-5D-3L) at 90 days. The results re-
mained unchanged after adjustment for baseline prognostic
factors (eTable 4 in Supplement 3). Mortality (Figure 4) was
similar in the oxygen (both groups combined) and control
groups (hazard ratio [HR], 0.97 [99% CI, 0.78 to 1.21]; P = .75),
and for continuous oxygen vs nocturnal oxygen (HR, 1.15 [99%
CI, 0.90 to 1.48]; P = .15).
Exploratory Analyses
There was no evidence of increased stress levels (higher heart
rates, higher blood pressure, and need for sedation) in the
oxygen-treatedgroupthaninthecontrolgrouporevidencethat
oxygen treatment was associated with more infections, with
little difference in the highest temperature or the need for an-
tibiotics (Table 2).
Safety Outcomes
The number of serious adverse events by 90 days was similar
in the combined oxygen and control groups, but lower in the
nocturnal oxygen group when compared with the continu-
ous oxygen group (Table 2; eTable 5 in Supplement 3). No oxy-
gen-related adverse events (respiratory depression, drying of
mucous membranes) were reported.
Discussion
In this clinical trial of patients with acute stroke, routine pro-
phylactic low-dose oxygen supplementation did not improve
outcome among patients who were not hypoxic at baseline,
whetheroxygenwasgivencontinuouslyfor72hoursoratnight
only. This applied to the primary 90-day functional outcome
and to all other tested outcomes, including early neurologi-
cal recovery, mortality, disability, independence in basic and
extended activities of daily living, and quality of life. The re-
sults remained unchanged in analyses adjusted for baseline
prognostic factors and in sensitivity analyses using multiple
imputation or analyzing adherers only. Subgroup analyses did
notidentifyanycharacteristicsthatwouldmakeapatientmore
likely to benefit from oxygen treatment (includes enrollment
between 3 to 6 hours after stroke onset, patients with a lower
baseline oxygen saturation, severe strokes, a reduced level of
consciousness, and a history of heart failure or lung disease
[ie, characteristics for which benefit from oxygen was most an-
ticipated]). Because of the large overall size of this trial, these
patient subgroups were each sufficiently large for the lack of
observed benefit to be likely real and not a false negative.

 In contrast to the much smaller SOS Pilot study,15 this trial
showed no evidence of better early neurological recovery with
oxygen. Subgroup analysis of an earlier study of low-dose oxy-
gen supplementation in acute stroke14 suggested that oxygen
might adversely affect outcome in patients with mild strokes,
possibly through formation of toxic free radicals. A more re-
cent study of short-burst high-flow oxygen (45 L/min) was
terminated early (after enrollment of 85 patients) because of
excess mortality in the actively treated group.13 Hyperoxia was
independently associated with mortality in a large retrospec-

The x-axis depicts the common odds ratio (OR) for a better outcome over all 7
levels of the modified Rankin Scale score (mRS), derived from ordinal logistic
regression. ORs greater than 1 indicate that a good outcome (low mRS) is more
likely with oxygen than with control (reference category). The size of the
markers reflects the total sample size in each subgroup, with larger markers
indicating more precise estimates. The subgroup thresholds for oxygen
concentration at randomization were revised from the prespecified thresholds
because the analysis did not converge using the prespecified values.

 tive cohort study of ventilated patients with stroke.28 Al-
though suggestive of potential harm, these findings could be
due to confounding factors.
As a large pragmatic trial, this study included unselected
patients with a clinical diagnosis of acute stroke without ra-
diological confirmation. The sample therefore included ische-
mic and hemorrhagic strokes and participants who were later
found to have mimics or transient ischemic attacks.
More than half of all acute stroke services in the
United Kingdom participated, and wide inclusion criteria
allowed enrollment of a representative sample of patients
with ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke across the whole
range of severity. Stroke severity was similar to that of
the UK stroke population as a whole, with a median NIHSS
of 5 in this trial and 4 in the UK Sentinel Stroke National
Audit Programme, which includes every stroke patient
admitted to UK hospitals.29 The median NIHSS of 127 950
patients with acute ischemic stroke in the US Get with the
Guidelines Register30 was 5, as in this trial. A median NIHSS
of 5 at baseline was also recorded in a large Dutch study of
antibiotic prophylaxis after stroke, with similarly wide
inclusion criteria.31
This study has several limitations. Minor benefits from
oxygen treatment might have been masked by poor adher-
ence. However, this seems unlikely given the high statistical
power to detect even small improvements. Moreover, sensi-
tivity analyses did not show better outcomes in the adherers-
only group (eTable 3 in Supplement 3). Furthermore, this trial
found significant increases in the oxygen saturations in the
treated groups compared with the control group. Patients
with acute stroke are often restless and confused. Ensuring
full adherence would ideally require a 1 to 1 nurse-to-patient
ratio. However, this is not possible outside an intensive care
setting. The main outcome was assessed by postal question-
naire and supported by telephone interviews with nonre-
sponders. This method has been used successfully in large
pragmatic trials32,33 but has been replaced by remote
multiple-rater video-recorded interviews or in-person inter-
view and examination by an allocation-blinded rater using
formal structured assessments in several more recent
studies.34 Low-dose oxygen supplementation may not be suf-
ficient to prevent severe desaturations; both the SOS Pilot15
and this trial found no significant difference in severe desatu-
rations between the treatment and control groups. A small
(N = 46) nonrandomized study comparing high-flow oxygen
treatment via mask with low-flow supplementation via nasal
cannula showed a trend toward lower mortality with high
flow that was not statistically significant. However, evidence
from randomized trials of high-flow oxygen treatment in
acute stroke11-13 does not show that higher doses of oxygen
are associated with better outcomes. Early administration of
high-dose oxygen might help maintain the viability of the
ischemic penumbra and allow a broader time window for
neuroprotection or thrombolysis. This question was not
addressed in this trial of prophylactic oxygen, but will be
tested in the PROOF trial.35
The median time from stroke onset to randomization in
this trial was 20 hours, 43 minutes. However, 101 partici-
pants were enrolled early (within 3 hours of symptom
onset). Subgroup analysis (Figure 3) showed a similar lack of
effect for oxygen in the small subset of patients enrolled
early as in those enrolled later but was underpowered.
Larger trials in the early time window would be needed to
definitely exclude a benefit.
Conclusions
Among nonhypoxic patients with acute stroke, the prophy-
lactic use of low-dose oxygen supplementation did not re-
ducedeathordisabilityat3months.Thesefindingsdonotsup-
port low-dose oxygen in this setting.
