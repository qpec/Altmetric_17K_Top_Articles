BACKGROUND: There are increasing concerns about risks associated 
with aspirin discontinuation in the absence of major surgery or bleeding. 
We investigated whether long-term low-dose aspirin discontinuation and 
treatment gaps increase the risk of cardiovascular events.
METHODS: We performed a cohort study of 601 
527 users of low-dose 
aspirin for primary or secondary prevention in the Swedish prescription 
register between 2005 and 2009 who were >40 years of age, were free 
from previous cancer, and had ≥80% adherence during the first observed 
year of treatment. Cardiovascular events were identified with the Swedish 
inpatient and cause-of-death registers. The first 3 months after a major 
bleeding or surgical procedure were excluded from the time at risk.
RESULTS: During a median of 3.0 years of follow-up, 62 
690 
cardiovascular events occurred. Patients who discontinued aspirin 
had a higher rate of cardiovascular events than those who continued 
(multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio, 1.37; 95% confidence interval, 1.34–
1.41), corresponding to an additional cardiovascular event observed per 
year in 1 of every 74 patients who discontinue aspirin. The risk increased 
shortly after discontinuation and did not appear to diminish over time.
CONCLUSIONS: In long-term users, discontinuation of low-dose aspirin 
in the absence of major surgery or bleeding was associated with a 
>30% increased risk of cardiovascular events. Adherence to low-dose 
aspirin treatment in the absence of major surgery or bleeding is likely an 
important treatment goal.

L
ow-dose aspirin has strong evidence for use in 
the secondary prevention of cardiovascular dis-
ease and is uniformly recommended in guide-
lines.1–3 Its utility in primary prevention is under in-
vestigation.4–6 In patients with a recent myocardial 
infarction, 10% to 20% have been reported to dis-
continue aspirin use during the first 17–9 to 310 years 
after the infarction. In broader patient settings, dis-
continuation rates of up to 30% have been reported, 
and poor aspirin compliance has been noted in up 
to 50%.11 The public health effects of discontinuing 
long-term aspirin treatment may be substantial but 
are not well known.
Discontinuation of secondary prevention with aspirin 
has been associated with higher risk of cardiovascular 
events in some studies,12,13 with indications of an in-
creased risk shortly after discontinuation.14–18 Aspirin 
is often withdrawn because of surgery14–17,19 or bleed-
ing,14,18 factors that per se may stimulate platelet ag-
gregation and increase the risk of cardiovascular events. 
Effects of discontinuation in settings other than surgery 
or bleeding are unknown.
Aspirin can be bought over the counter in many 
countries, and previous studies have typically relied on 
self-reported use data. Registers with complete cover-
age in a country where low-dose aspirin is available 
only by prescription have a unique potential to shed 
light on the issue.
We hypothesized that patients with aspirin treat-
ment gaps and those who discontinue long-term aspi-
rin treatment in the absence of major surgery or bleed-
ing are at higher risk of cardiovascular events than 
adherent patients without treatment gaps. We aimed 
to investigate the associations of aspirin treatment per-
sistence patterns and aspirin discontinuation with risk 
of cardiovascular events using a large nationwide co-
hort of patients on long-term low-dose aspirin therapy 
for primary and secondary prevention.
METHODS
Study Sample
Using the unique civil registration number allocated to all 
Swedish citizens, we linked the mandatory nationwide 
Swedish prescribed drug register with the mandatory inpa-
tient and cause-of-death registers with the help of the 
Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare. In Sweden, 
low-dose aspirin cannot be purchased over the counter with-
out a prescription.
For this study, we considered all individuals >40 years of 
age who had collected prescribed aspirin during the study 
period between July 1, 2005, and December 31, 2009, as 
identified in the prescribed drug register by the detection 
of an aspirin dispense of 75 to 160 mg. We also included 
aspirin 75 to 160 mg dispensed as part of pharmacy-pre-
packed multidose prescriptions used for patients unable 
to safely self-administer their medication. Aspirin tablet 
strengths other than 75 or 160 mg are not available for 
prevention of cardiovascular events in Sweden; neither is 
carbasalate calcium (B01AC08). We considered all 889 655 
aspirin-treated patients who were free from previous can-
cer (International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision 
codes C00–C99) at baseline. We were interested in treat-
ment breaks and permanent discontinuation after a stable 
(1-year) period of continuous aspirin treatment. Therefore, 
we excluded 207 180 patients who had <292 defined daily 
doses of aspirin dispensed during the first year after their 
first aspirin prescription (which equals 1 year of aspirin treat-
ment with ≥80% adherence, or medication possession ratio, 
which is commonly viewed as adequate20). We also excluded 
80 621 patients who had a cardiovascular event (because our 
research question involved long-term use) or died during this 
first year of aspirin treatment, as well as 327 patients with-
out any exposure time after the first year, rendering a final 
study sample of 601 527 long-term low-dose aspirin users 
who entered the follow-up phase.
To study treatment patterns in aspirin-naïve patients, we 
also studied a sample of 227 
135 patients who collected their 
first low-dose aspirin dispense at least 1 year after the start 
of the study period. This subsample was not subjected to the 
1-year definition of long-term users and was not used in any 
statistical modeling.
In a second set of analyses, the timing of cardiovascu-
lar events in people who discontinued aspirin was investi-
gated. We defined inclusion criteria on the dispense level and 
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• Discontinuing long-term low-dose aspirin treat-
ment in the absence of major surgery or bleeding 
may be hazardous.
• We investigated that question among 601 
527 
users of low-dose aspirin for primary or secondary 
prevention identified in the Swedish drug prescrip-
tion register.
• Patients who discontinued aspirin had a 37% 
higher rate of cardiovascular events than those 
who continued, corresponding to an additional 
cardiovascular event observed per year in 1 of every 
74 patients who discontinue aspirin.
• The risk increased shortly after discontinuation and 
did not appear to diminish over time.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• Adherence to low-dose aspirin treatment in the 
absence of major surgery or bleeding is likely an 
important treatment goal.
• Millions of patients worldwide take aspirin on a 
daily basis and might consider stopping at some 
time during their lives.
• This article may help physicians and patients to 
make an informed decision on whether to stop 
aspirin use.

defined a timely dispense as one that was collected between 
0 and 10 days before the end of the previous timely dis-
pense, and it had to be the last in a chain of 4 consecutive 
timely dispenses (typically equal to 1 year of treatment, cho-
sen to balance strictness of the inclusion criteria with statisti-
cal power). This strict definition, although rendering a small 
sample of patients with presumed high adherence, was used 
to determine the time of discontinuation as precisely as pos-
sible and to avoid periods of accumulated medication dur-
ing and after which drug use status is more uncertain. This 
sample included the 38 736 patients who had 4 consecutive 
timely dispenses.
The construction of the samples is displayed in Figure 1.
Ethics approval was obtained from the Ethics Review Board 
in Uppsala, Sweden. No informed consent was required.
Clinical Characteristics
All definitions are described in Table I in the online-only Data 
Supplement. Age, sex, and diabetes mellitus were deter-
mined at the inclusion date—that is, the first day of the 
first stable 1-year period of continuous aspirin treatment. 
Use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, oral steroids, 
and antiplatelet (other than aspirin) or oral anticoagulant 
drugs was defined as the fraction of an aspirin treatment 
period covered by the respective drug and was time updated 
during follow-up. Concomitant cardiovascular disease was 
defined as a prior hospitalization for myocardial infarction 
(International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision codes 
I21 and I22) or stroke (International Classification of Diseases, 
10th Revision codes I63 and I64). Patients with concomitant 
cardiovascular disease were defined as users of aspirin for 
secondary prevention. Patients without concomitant cardio-
vascular were presumed to use their aspirin for primary pre-
vention. Major bleeding was defined as a hospital admission 
caused by gastrointestinal bleeding, intracranial bleeding, 
hemopericardium, postoperative bleeding, bleeding from 
venous varices, bleeding events in the respiratory system, 
hematuria, and other signs of blood loss. We determined 
the occurrence of surgery as all surgical procedures except 
small diagnostic procedures such as gastroscopy and coro-
nary angiography.
Exposures
We investigated 2 sets of exposures. In the first set of com-
parisons, we constructed groups based on time-updated 
aspirin treatment persistence patterns. In the second 
set, we constructed groups that were on aspirin versus 
those that had just discontinued aspirin treatment. For 
both exposures, time spent in the hospital for diagnoses 
other than the outcome was added to the time at risk for 
the particular exposure group at the time of admission 
because patients are provided all in-hospital medications

free of charge and hence do not use their dispensed pre-
scribed medications during hospitalization. We were well 
equipped to study persistence (staying on a drug long term 
or discontinuing) but not adherence (taking the prescribed 
number of pills).
Aspirin Treatment Persistence Patterns
To record time on aspirin and off aspirin as accurately as pos-
sible, accounting for the fact that the exact time of discon-
tinuation is uncertain, we constructed 4 time-updated aspirin 
persistence groups, between which patients could move 
freely over time during follow-up:
1. On aspirin: the nominal duration of each aspirin 
dispense.
2. Accumulated period: the time after the nominal dura-
tion of each aspirin dispense when the patient has tab-
lets left over from previous dispenses in a consecutively 
dispensed period.
3. Grace period: from the end of the accumulated period 
plus 25% of the total duration on aspirin in the last 
consecutively dispensed period plus 20 days. This cor-
responds to 80% adherence with up to a week’s gap 
between dispenses.
4. Off aspirin: from the end of the grace period.
Although the hypothesis is answered with the use of groups 
1 and 4, the other 2 groups are included for transparency. 
Persistence patterns were described for both aspirin-naïve 
patients and long-term aspirin users.
Timing of Events After Aspirin Discontinuation
For this set of analyses, we sought to determine the risk of 
cardiovascular events in relation to the time of the aspirin dis-
continuation among patients who collected their dispenses in 
a timely manner (as defined above). We compared patients 
who collected a timely fifth dispense with patients who did 
not after a series of 4 timely dispenses. A patient could con-
tribute several times at risk to these analyses.
Follow-Up and Outcomes
Outcomes were defined with the Swedish inpatient and 
cause-of-death registers, which include all hospitalizations 
and deaths, respectively, classified with the International 
Classification of Diseases (codes in Table I in the online-only 
Data Supplement). The outcome investigated was a first inci-
dence of cardiovascular disease after the start of follow-up, 
defined as a hospitalization for myocardial infarction, stroke, 
or cardiovascular death. Only the primary diagnoses in the 
discharge letter or death certificates were used for classifi-
cation of the outcome. The accuracy in the Swedish regis-
ters is high for the diagnoses examined in this study (positive 
predictive values, 98%–100% for myocardial infarction and 
69%–98% for stroke).21
Because there may be a risk of reverse causation (aspirin 
withdrawn from people about to die), we also investigated 
a secondary nonfatal cardiovascular events outcome similar 
to the primary outcome but without cardiovascular death. A 
similar bias may arise if patients discontinue aspirin because 
they start using an oral anticoagulant as a result of change to 
a higher risk stratum; we therefore also investigated models 
censoring participants at the time of start of oral anticoagu-
lant treatment.
Follow-up started after 1 year of aspirin treatment with 
high adherence, as defined above. Patients were followed 
up until the first instance of the cardiovascular outcome, a 
new diagnosis of cancer, noncardiovascular death, or the end 
of follow-up on December 31, 2009. In the timing of events 
after aspirin discontinuation analyses, patients were also cen-
sored after 100 days because that is the maximum duration 
of the fifth dispense. Patients were followed up from the day 
after dispense (or start of a gap) until a cardiovascular disease 
event or censoring, whichever came first.
Major bleeding and surgical procedures may affect throm-
bogenicity, cause aspirin discontinuation, and be related to 
cardiovascular disease incidence for an unknown duration of 
time that we assumed to be less than a few months. Therefore, 
in this study, a major bleeding or a surgical procedure during 
the study incurred a 3-month refractory period from the time 
at risk, during which person-time was not counted and out-
comes were not considered.
Statistical Analysis
Baseline characteristics were presented per patient as 
observed numbers (percentages) for categorical variables 
and as means (SDs) for continuous variables. Absolute risks 
of events were illustrated with Nelson-Aalen cumulative inci-
dence plots, which were also used to assess proportionality 
of hazards.
Cox proportional hazards models were used to investi-
gate associations of the 4 aspirin persistence groups with 
risk of cardiovascular events. Models for minimizing bias 
were identified with directed acyclic graphs (Figure I in the 
online-only Data Supplement).22 All models were adjusted 
for age, sex, previous cardiovascular disease, diabetes mel-
litus, antiplatelet or oral anticoagulant drugs, nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs, and oral steroids. Interactions in 
the form of deviation from multiplicativity were investigated 
between the aspirin persistence groups and age, sex, prior 
cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs, oral steroids, other antiplatelet or oral 
anticoagulant drugs, aspirin-naïve/non-naïve, previous major 
bleeding, and pharmacy-prepacked multidose dispenses. 
Because of potential interaction signals, the main analyses 
were also performed in subgroups with and without prior 
cardiovascular disease.
For the timing of events after aspirin discontinuation anal-
ysis to which patients could contribute >1 observation period, 
a model with shared frailty for participant identity was used. 
Because we assumed a priori that the hazard function associ-
ated with aspirin discontinuation may initially be nonmono-
tonic and because we wanted to compute time quantiles, 
we investigated parametric regression models with exponen-
tial, Gompertz, Weibull, log logistic, and log normal param-
eterizations. The log normal distribution had the highest log 
likelihood and lowest Akaike information criterion and was 
used, with results displayed graphically and presented in the 
accelerated failure time metric. This analysis was adjusted for 
the same covariates as the Cox models, and the same set of 
covariates was time updated at each dispense.
Because this study used only official registers mandatory 
for all citizens, we assumed that no data were missing. The 
data were managed and analyzed at both an independent

University, and all authors had full access to the data. The 
statistical packages R version 3.0.1 and Stata version 14 
were used.
RESULTS
Clinical characteristics of the aspirin treatment persis-
tence groups are displayed in Table 1. Notably, half of 
the sample were female, the mean age was 73 years, 
16% had diabetes mellitus, and half of the sample were 
on long-term aspirin treatment without having had a 
prior hospitalization for cardiovascular disease. During 
a median of 3.0 years of follow-up (range, 0.002–3.5 
years), corresponding to 1 
491 
369 person-years at risk, 
62 
690 cardiovascular events occurred (incidence rate, 
42.0 per 1000 person-years at risk; separate outcomes 
presented in Table II in the online-only Data Supple-
ment). A total of 73 
636 people died during this time; 
19 
978 person-years were excluded from the analyses 
because of surgical procedures and major bleeding 
events as defined above.
Treatment patterns are displayed in Figure 2 and Fig-
ure II in the online-only Data Supplement. Among the 
long-term low-dose aspirin users (Figure 2), persistence 
gradually but slowly tapered off; 3 years after inclu-
sion, 3 of 4 patients collected their aspirin dispenses 
before the expiration of the previous dispense, and 4 
of 5 had access to accumulated aspirin. Approximately 
15% were off long-term aspirin treatment after 3 years. 
Among the 227 
135 aspirin-naïve patients, ≈20% did 
not collect a second aspirin prescription (Figure II in the 
online-only Data Supplement). After the first year of in-
consistent prescription collections, those who remained 
on treatment had approximately the same persistence 
pattern as those treated with long-term aspirin.
Adjusted cumulative incidence of cardiovascu-
lar events according to aspirin treatment persistence 
groups is presented in Figure 3. Patients on persistent 
aspirin treatment had the lowest incidence of cardio-
vascular events. Patients who had discontinued as-
pirin had a 37% higher rate of cardiovascular events 
(Table 2), corresponding to an absolute risk increase of

CVD indicates cardiovascular disease; and NSAID, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug. On aspirin is the nominal duration 
of each aspirin dispense. Accumulated is the time after the nominal duration of each aspirin dispense when the patient 
has tablets left over from previous dispenses in a consecutively dispensed period. Grace period is from the end of the 
accumulated period plus 25% of the total duration on aspirin in the last consecutively dispensed period plus 20 days. This 
corresponds to 80% adherence with up to a week’s gap between dispenses. Off aspirin is from the end of the grace period.

13.5 events per 1000 person-years at risk. Put another 
way, on average, 1 of every 74 patients who discontin-
ued aspirin had an additional cardiovascular event in 1 
year.
Subgroup analyses further revealed that patients 
with higher age and prior cardiovascular disease were 
at higher risk increase for cardiovascular events when 
off aspirin, whereas treatment with oral anticoagulant 
or other antiplatelet drugs was associated with lower 
risk increase for cardiovascular events when off aspi-
rin (Figure 4). The majority (54%) of the study sample 
used aspirin for secondary prevention. Among those, 
discontinuing aspirin was associated with a 46% higher 
rate of cardiovascular events than continuing on aspirin 
(Table 2), corresponding to an absolute risk increase of 
28.0 per 1000 person-years at risk or an additional car-
diovascular event per year in 1 of every 36 patients who 
discontinued aspirin. Among the 46% who probably 
used aspirin as part of primary prevention, discontinuing 
aspirin was associated with a 28% higher rate of car-
diovascular events than continuing on aspirin (Table 2), 
an absolute risk increase of 6.9 per 1000 person-years 
at risk or an additional cardiovascular event per year in 
1 of every 146 patients who discontinued aspirin.
Aspirin discontinuation was also associated with non-
fatal cardiovascular events, with a 10% higher risk of 
nonfatal cardiovascular events among people off versus 
on aspirin (Table III in the online-only Data Supplement). 
Censoring participants at the start of oral anticoagulant 
therapy produced results very similar to those of the 
main models, with a 43% higher risk of cardiovascular 
events if discontinuing rather than continuing on aspirin 
(Table IV in the online-only Data Supplement).
The timing of events after aspirin discontinuation 
analyses included 38 
736 patients with 40 
355 times at 
risk during which 216 cardiovascular events occurred. 
Patients who stopped taking aspirin after a period of 4 
timely dispenses had an early risk increase for cardiovas-
cular events compared with those who collected their 
fifth timely dispense (Figure 5). The median time to the 
first cardiovascular event in those who did not collect 
their fifth dispense on schedule was one-third the time 
of those who collected their dispense on schedule (time 
ratio, 0.31; 95% confidence interval, 0.22–0.43).
DISCUSSION
In this large nationwide patient cohort, discontinuation 
of long-term low-dose aspirin was associated with a 
>30% higher risk of cardiovascular events, correspond-
ing to an additional cardiovascular event observed per 
year in 1 of every 74 patients who discontinue aspirin. 
The risk appeared to increase as soon as the patients 
discontinued aspirin, with no safe interval. In this sam-
ple, only half of the low-dose aspirin users had been 
hospitalized for cardiovascular disease before baseline;

lar disease, antiplatelet or oral anticoagulant drugs, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and oral steroids. On aspirin is the 
nominal duration of each aspirin dispense. Accumulated is the time after the nominal duration of each aspirin dispense when 
the patient has tablets left over from previous dispenses in a consecutively dispensed period. Grace period is from the end of 
accumulated period plus 25% of the total duration on aspirin in the last consecutively dispensed period plus 20 days. This cor-
responds to 80% adherence with up to a week’s gap between dispenses. Off aspirin is from the end of the grace period.

most of the remaining half were presumably treated, 
for example, for angina pectoris or stroke prevention 
in atrial fibrillation or treated as part of primary pre-
vention. Aspirin discontinuation appeared especially 
perilous among patients with previous cardiovascular 
disease, with an additional cardiovascular event per 
year in 1 of every 36 secondary prevention patients 
who discontinued aspirin compared with an additional 
cardiovascular event per year in 1 of every 146 primary 
prevention patients who discontinued aspirin.
We confirm a high initial discontinuation rate, as 
seen in prior studies7–11: 1 of 5 aspirin-naïve patients 
did not collect the second aspirin dispense, and the 
main persistence drop was during the first year after 
aspirin initiation. In contrast, those who picked up 
their second prescription had a modest discontinua-
tion rate over time.
Our observations of the risks associated with low-
dose aspirin discontinuation are of a magnitude very 
similar to those of previous randomized trials of aspi-
rin initiation.1,5 However, the timing of cardiovascular 
events after aspirin discontinuation remains uncertain. 
Although those analyses were based on a small number 
of events, the risk in this study appeared to increase 
shortly after discontinuation. An acutely increased risk 
of cerebrovascular events,14,15 ischemic events,15–17 and 
mortality16 has been observed in case-control stud-
ies,14,16 in perioperative studies,15,17 and in individuals 
with bleeding ulcers.18 In those studies, the main rea-
sons for aspirin withdrawal were surgery14–17 or bleed-
ing,14,18 which per se may stimulate platelet aggrega-
tion. No increase in cardiovascular events was observed 
in a recent perioperative aspirin discontinuation trial,19 
although aspirin was stopped within 24 hours before 
the surgery in that study. Notably, the present study in-
vestigated aspirin discontinuation that was unrelated to 
surgery or bleeding events.
Experimental studies have suggested a rebound ef-
fect after aspirin discontinuation, involving increased 
thromboxane levels23,24 possibly resulting from the pro-
thrombotic effects of residual very low levels of aspi-
rin.25 The clinical importance of a rebound effect may 
be substantial because of the large number of aspirin 
patients and the high discontinuation rates. For pa-
tients undergoing planned surgery or other procedures, 
it is unknown whether treatment gaps >7 days or <24 
hours before the procedure are safe.19 For patients dis-
continuing aspirin therapy, it is unknown whether or 
when the rebound effect happens. In addition, for pa-
tients with poor adherence, any rebound effects may 
be in play more or less continuously. The possibility of 
such mechanisms is supported by the observation in 
this study that aspirin discontinuation was not associ-
ated with cardiovascular events in patients protected by 
other antiplatelet or oral anticoagulant drugs (Figure 4), 
although those patients were likely at higher absolute 
risk of such events.
Some limitations of this study are worth mention-
ing. Most important, there is a risk of confounding, as 
in all observational studies. We did not have access to 
data on socioeconomic status; physical examinations, 
including blood pressures and lipids; or lifestyle mea-
sures such as smoking. However, we used directed 
acyclic graphs to identify bias-minimized models and 
included only people who had qualified as long-term 
users of aspirin. Furthermore, any confounding by in-
dication would bias toward a null result, assuming that 
people with the highest risk of cardiovascular events 
would be the ones least likely to discontinue aspirin 
treatment. There is also a risk of reverse causation—
that is, patients about to die stop taking aspirin and 
then die anyway. Associations of aspirin discontinua-
tion with the secondary nonfatal cardiovascular events 
outcome were similar but weaker, which may signify 
some reverse causation, a protective effect of aspirin 
against fatal events, or lower statistical power in those 
analyses. Models censoring at the time of start of oral 
anticoagulant treatment produced results similar to the 
main results, indicating low risk of reverse causation 
by patients discontinuing aspirin treatment because of 
moving to a higher risk stratum and switching to oral

All models were adjusted for age, sex, diabetes mellitus, antiplatelet drugs, oral 
anticoagulant drugs, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and oral steroids. 
Models in the total sample were also adjusted for prior cardiovascular disease. 
On aspirin is the nominal duration of each aspirin dispense. Accumulated is the 
time after the nominal duration of each aspirin dispense when the patient has 
tablets left over from previous dispenses in a consecutively dispensed period. 
Grace period is from the end of accumulated period plus 25% of the total 
duration on aspirin in the last consecutively dispensed period plus 20 days. This 
corresponds to 80% adherence with up to a week’s gap between dispenses. 
Off aspirin is from the end of the grace period.

anticoagulant therapy. An important limitation is the 
imprecision in determining the exposure status, which 
also would bias the results toward the null hypothesis. 
This is confirmed by the results among people with pre-
packed dispenses, for which we have good precision 
in the exposure. These patients appear to be at clearly 
higher risk of aspirin discontinuation than those who 
collect dispenses themselves. Thus, the true effect is 
likely higher than the main observed effect. Another 
limitation is the end of follow-up in 2009, which implies 
lack of information on more recent treatment patterns 
but, on the other hand, avoids cohort effect bias be-
cause aspirin guidelines were stable during the study 
period.
Strengths include the large contemporary sample 
rendering >60 000 cardiovascular events, universal 
coverage of the prescription register and hence inclu-
sion of all long-term low-dose aspirin users nation-
wide, the universal coverage of the high-precision21 
registers for determining the outcomes, and minimal 
loss to follow-up.
Conclusions
Among long-term users of low-dose aspirin, discon-
tinuation of aspirin in the absence of major surgery or 
bleeding was associated with a >30% increased risk of 
cardiovascular events. The risk increased shortly after 
discontinuation. These findings can help policymakers 
focus on simple measures to ensure treatment persis-
