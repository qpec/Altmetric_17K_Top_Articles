De novo loss-of-function mutations in the voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) SCN1A
(encoding Nav1.1) are the main cause of Dravet syndrome (DS), a catastrophic early-life
encephalopathy associated with prolonged and recurrent early-life febrile seizures (FSs),
refractory afebrile epilepsy, cognitive and behavioral deficits, and a 15–20% mortality
rate. SCN1A mutations also lead to genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+),
which is an inherited disorder characterized by early-life FSs and the development of a
range of adult epilepsy subtypes. Current antiepileptic drugs often fail to protect against
the severe seizures and behavioral and cognitive deficits found in patients with SCN1A
mutations. To address the need for more efficacious treatments for SCN1A-derived
epilepsies, we evaluated the therapeutic potential of Huperzine A, a naturally occurring
reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. In CF1 mice, Hup A (0.56 or 1 mg/kg) was
found to confer protection against 6 Hz-, pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-, and maximal
electroshock (MES)-induced seizures. Robust protection against 6 Hz-, MES-, and
hyperthermia-induced seizures was also achieved following Hup A administration
in mouse models of DS (
+/−) and GEFS
(
RH
Scn1a
+
Scn1a
/+). Furthermore, Hup
A-mediated seizure protection was sustained during 3 weeks of daily injections in
RH
Scn1a
/+ mutants. Finally, we determined that muscarinic and GABAA receptors play
a role in Hup A-mediated seizure protection. These findings indicate that Hup A might
provide a novel therapeutic strategy for increasing seizure resistance in DS and GEFS+,
and more broadly, in other forms of refractory epilepsy.

INTRODUCTION
Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder that affects 0.5–1% of the population and is
characterized by recurrent seizures that often manifest during childhood. Despite a growing
number of available antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), the efficacy of pharmacological intervention for
epilepsy has not improved substantially in the last 30 years (Kwan and Brodie, 2006), highlighting
the critical need to develop alternative treatments, while minimizing unwanted side effects.
Towards this goal, the use of appropriate genetic models of human epilepsy to evaluate potential
AEDs might provide a better predictor of clinical efficacy (Loscher and Schmidt, 1994).
 Wong et al.
Huperzine A and Seizure Resistance
Genetic factors play an important role in the etiology
of epilepsy, and the neuronal voltage-gated sodium channels
(VGSCs) have emerged as an important family of epilepsy
genes (Catterall et al., 2010; Escayg and Goldin, 2010; O’Brien
and Meisler, 2013). De novo loss-of-function mutations in the
VGSC SCN1A (encoding Nav1.1 channels) are the main cause of
Dravet syndrome (DS), a catastrophic early-life encephalopathy
associated with prolonged and recurrent early-life febrile seizures
(FSs), refractory afebrile epilepsy, cognitive and behavioral
deficits, and a 15–20% mortality rate (Claes et al., 2001, 2009;
Wallace et al., 2003; Lossin, 2009; Escayg and Goldin, 2010).
Current AEDs used to treat DS include stiripentol, valproate, and
benzodiazepines, as well as the ketogenic diet (Chiron and Dulac,
2011). Unfortunately, most DS patients do not achieve adequate
seizure control, nor do they demonstrate sufficient improvements
in behavior or cognitive function (Dravet et al., 2005). SCN1A
mutations also lead to genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures plus
(GEFS+), which is an inherited disorder characterized by FSs
that persist beyond 6 years of age and the development of adult
epilepsy (Escayg et al., 2000, 2001). SCN1A mutations account for
at least 80 and 10% of DS and GEFS+ cases, respectively (Claes
et al., 2009; Lossin, 2009; Escayg and Goldin, 2010).
We previously described the generation of a mouse model of
GEFS+ by knock-in of the human SCN1A GEFS+ mutation,
R1648H (Martin et al., 2010). Heterozygous Scn1aR1648H/+
mutants (Scn1aRH/+) exhibit spontaneous seizures, increased
seizure susceptibility, and behavioral deficits (Martin et al., 2010;
Papale et al., 2013; Purcell et al., 2013). Homozygous mutants
exhibit frequent spontaneous seizures and typically die 3–4
weeks after birth (Martin et al., 2010). Heterozygous knockout
mice (Scn1a+/−), a model of DS, exhibit frequent spontaneous
seizures and behavioral deficits, whereas homozygous DS
mice exhibit spontaneous seizures, ataxia, and have a lifespan
of ∼15 days (Yu et al., 2006; Ogiwara et al., 2007). The
hippocampus has been proposed as the site of spontaneous
seizure generation in DS (Liautard et al., 2013), and dissociated
cortical and hippocampal neurons from GEFS+ and DS mutants
show decreased GABAergic interneuron excitability (Yu et al.,
2006; Ogiwara et al., 2007; Martin et al., 2010). In addition,
we and others recently showed that the selective deletion
of Scn1a from parvalbumin interneurons in the cortex and
hippocampus is sufficient to increase seizure susceptibility and
generate spontaneous seizures (Dutton et al., 2012; Tai et al.,
2014).
Huperzine A (Hup A), originally isolated from the Chinese
club moss Huperzia serrata (Ma et al., 2007), is a naturally
occurring sesquiterpene Lycopodium alkaloid (Ma et al., 2007).
Hup
A
is
a
potent,
highly
specific
reversible
inhibitor
of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) that can cross the blood-
brain barrier to significantly increase brain acetylcholine
levels (Ma et al., 2007). Both isomers of Huperzine A, the
naturally occurring form ([−]-Hup A) and the synthetic
isomer ([+]-Hup A), can also act as dose-dependent NMDA
receptor antagonists, reducing NMDA- and glutamate-induced
neurotoxicity (Ved et al., 1997; Gordon et al., 2001). However,
the naturally occurring isomer, [−]-Hup A, is 38 times more
potent at inhibiting AChE compared to [+]-Hup A (McKinney
et al., 1991) and does not bind to the NMDA receptor at affinities
that would be attainable for clinical use. [−]-Hup A also protects
against apoptosis following ischemia/reperfusion (Ye et al., 2010)
and in neuronal cultures (Hemendinger et al., 2008), attenuates
mitochondrial dysfunction in vivo (Yang et al., 2012) and in
isolated brain mitochondria (Gao and Tang, 2006), and reduces
cholinergic pathway-mediated inflammatory responses (Wang
et al., 2008).
Hup A has proved beneficial in several animal and cell culture
models of neurological disease (Hemendinger et al., 2008; Wang
et al., 2008). Following administration to healthy volunteers and
patients, Hup A demonstrated clinically acceptable safety and
tolerability (Wang et al., 2009). There are also reports of its
efficacy in neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease
(Wang et al., 2009), benign senescent forgetfulness (Wang et al.,
2006), vascular dementia (Xu et al., 2012), and schizophrenia
(Zhang et al., 2007). Adverse events are infrequent, generally
mild, and transient; these include dizziness, gastric discomfort,
insomnia, and sweating (Zangara, 2003; Yang et al., 2013).
In the current study, we evaluated the anticonvulsant potential
of the naturally occurring [−]-Hup A isomer in mouse models of
SCN1A-derived GEFS+ and DS. Given the underlying reduction
in neuronal inhibition (Yu et al., 2006; Ogiwara et al., 2007;
Martin et al., 2010) and the role of the hippocampus in seizure
generation in SCN1A-acquired epilepsy (Liautard et al., 2013),
we hypothesize that Hup A would restore a more normal balance
between neuronal inhibition and excitation in epilepsy subtypes
that are caused by mutations in SCN1A. Although not assessed in
this study, additional biological properties of Hup A, including
protection against cell death (Hemendinger et al., 2008) and
inflammation (Wang et al., 2012), would also be of expected
benefit in the treatment of epilepsy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals
Heterozygous mice expressing the human SCN1A R1648H
GEFS+ mutation (Scn1aRH/+) and heterozygous Scn1a knock-
out mice (Scn1a+/−) were generated as previously described
(Yu
et
al.,
2006;
Martin
et
al.,
2010)
and
maintained
by backcrossing to the C57BL/6J and FVB backgrounds,
respectively. Experiments were conducted at the N13 generation
for Scn1aRH/+ mutants and on a mixed FVB X C57BL/6J
background for Scn1a+/− mutants. Scn1a mutants and their
respective wild-type (WT) littermates at P21-23 were used in the
febrile seizure (FS) induction paradigm. Scn1aRH/+ (3–5 months
old) and Scn1a+/− (4–6 weeks old) mutants and their respective
age-matched WT littermates, as well as 6–8-week-old male CF1
mice (Charles River), were used for all other experiments. WT
littermates were used as controls for all experiments to minimize
variation due to differences in genetic background and rearing
conditions. All mice were housed on a 12-h light/dark cycle,
with food and water available ad libitum. All experiments were
conducted during the light cycle prior to 4:00 p.m. and were
performed in accordance with the guidelines of the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee of Emory University. In
experiments where both mutants and WT littermates were

used, the experimenter was blinded to genotype. However,
since Hup A administration results in visible mild side effects,
it was not possible for the experimenter to be blinded to
treatment.
Huperzine A Administration
Huperzine A (Hup A; Biscayne Pharmaceuticals) was suspended
in a 10% solution of cyclodextrin (CD, 2-hydroxypropyl-β-
cyclodextrin, Sigma-Aldrich) dissolved in sterile saline (0.9%).
Hup A was administered via intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection
(10 ml/kg) 1 h prior to seizure induction, based on previous
studies that demonstrated maximum brain AChE inhibition at
1 h following Hup A administration (Tang et al., 1989). Control
mice were handled similarly but were only administered vehicle
(Veh, 10% CD).
Acetylcholinesterase Activity
Male CF1 mice (N = 3–4/dose) were administered either Hup A
(doses based on a ¼ logarithmic scale: 0.10, 0.18, 0.32, 0.56, 1, or
1.8 mg/kg) or vehicle 1 h prior to sacrifice. The right hemisphere
of the brain was used for quantification of protein (Pierce BCA
Protein Assay, Thermo Scientific) and AChE activity using the
standard spectrophotometric method (Ellman et al., 1961; Padilla
et al., 1999).
6 Hz Psychomotor Seizure Induction
Seizures were induced by the 6 Hz paradigm as previously
described (Barton et al., 2001; Gilchrist et al., 2014). Briefly,
1 h prior to seizure induction, mice were administered either
Hup A or vehicle (i.p.), and a topical anesthetic (0.5% tetracaine
hydrochloride) was applied to the cornea. Each mouse was
manually restrained during corneal stimulation (6 Hz, 0.2-ms
pulse, 3 s) using a constant current device (ECT Unit 57800; Ugo
Basile, Comerio, Italy), and then immediately placed in a clean
cage for behavioral observations. Seizures were scored based on
a modified Racine Scale (RS; Gilchrist et al., 2014): RS0, no
abnormal behavior; RS1, immobile ≥ 3 s; RS2, forelimb clonus,
paw waving; RS3, rearing and falling.
To determine the relationship between Hup A dose and
susceptibility to 6 Hz-induced seizures, a ¼ logarithmic dose-
response curve was generated following Hup A (0.10, 0.18, 0.32,
0.56, 1 mg/kg) or vehicle administration in male CF1 mice
(N = 12). The 6 Hz paradigm was performed at a current of
44 mA, which was previously found to be twice the convulsive
current at which 97% of CF1 mice seize (2xCC97; Barton et al.,
2001). Over a 6-week experimental period, seizure induction
was performed once per week on each mouse following the
randomized administration of either vehicle or one of the Hup
A doses, ensuring that all mice received each Hup A dose.
The effect of Hup A (1 mg/kg) on 6 Hz-induced seizures was
evaluated further in a separate cohort of male CF1 mice (44 mA,
N = 15). We also examined the effect of Hup A (0.5 and 1
mg/kg) on 6 Hz-induced seizures in male Scn1aRH/+ (N = 9–
12) and male Scn1a+/− (N = 8–11) mice and their respective
WT littermates. CF1 mice and Scn1a mutants and their WT
littermates were randomized into 2 groups (0.5 mg/kg Hup A
or Veh) over 2 trials (1 week apart). Mice that received Hup
A during the first trial subsequently received vehicle during the
second trial, and vice versa. The same experimental design was
applied to separate cohorts of CF1 mice, Scn1a mutants and
WT littermates using 1 mg/kg Hup A and vehicle. Scn1aRH/+
and Scn1a+/− mice were first tested at currents of 24 and
20 mA, respectively. The experiment was subsequently repeated
in separate groups of mice at twice the initial current intensity
(Scn1aRH/+ = 48 mA, Scn1a+/− = 40 mA).

(pentylenetetrazole, 25 mg/kg, Sigma-Aldrich), or a nicotinic
receptor antagonist (bupropion hydrochloride (BH), 5 mg/kg,

each mouse and 6 Hz seizure induction (44 mA). All compounds
were dissolved in sterile saline (0.9%). Similarly handled mice
administered vehicle (cyclodextrin) or saline were used as
controls.
Maximal Electroshock Seizure Induction
Maximal electroshock seizures were induced as previously
described (Swinyard, 1972). One hour prior to seizure induction,
a topical anesthetic (0.5% tetracaine hydrochloride) was applied
to the cornea, and Hup A (0.5 or 1 mg/kg) or vehicle was
administered (i.p.) to male CF1 mice (N = 10/treatment),
and male and female Scn1a+/− and Scn1aRH/+ mutants
and their respective age- and sex-matched WT littermates
(N = 5–13/genotype/treatment). Each mouse was manually
restrained, subjected to corneal stimulation (60 Hz, 50 mA, 0.2 s;
ECT Unit 57800 Ugo Basile, Comerio, Italy), and observed for the
presence or absence of a seizure.
In a separate cohort of male CF1 mice (N = 6), body
temperature was maintained at 37.5◦C during the 1-h period
following the administration of Hup A (1 mg/kg) prior to MES
induction. Body temperature was maintained by the use of a
rectal temperature probe connected to a heat lamp, with a
thermostat set at 37.5◦C.
Pentylenetetrazole Seizure Induction
Pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) seizures were induced as previously
described (Loscher et al., 1991). Hup A (1 mg/kg) or vehicle
was administered (i.p.) to male CF1 mice (N = 6/group) 1 h
prior to subcutaneous PTZ injection (85 mg/kg). PTZ (Sigma-
Aldrich) was dissolved in sterile saline (0.9%). Latencies to the
first myoclonic jerk (MJ) and generalized tonic-clonic seizure
(GTCS) were recorded over a 30-min observation period.
Flurothyl Seizure Induction
The effect of Hup A (1 mg/kg) or vehicle on seizures
induced by the chemiconvulsant flurothyl (Prichahd et al.,
1969; Dutton et al., 2011) was evaluated in male CF1 mice
(N = 13–15/treatment). One hour prior to seizure induction,
Hup A or vehicle was administered (i.p.) to each mouse. Next,
each mouse was placed in a clear acrylic chamber and flurothyl

Huperzine A and Seizure Resistance
(2,2,2-trifluroethylether; Sigma-Aldrich) was introduced at a
constant rate of 20 µL/min. Latencies to the first MJ and
generalized tonic-clonic seizure with hindlimb extension (GTCS-
HLE) were recorded.
Hyperthermia Seizure Induction
Susceptibility to hyperthermia-induced seizures were evaluated
in male and female Scn1aRH/+ (N = 4–6) and Scn1a+/− (N =
9) mutants and their respective WT littermates (N = 3–7) at
P21-23 as previously described (Oakley et al., 2009; Dutton
et al., 2013). One hour prior to seizure induction, mice were
administered Hup A (1 mg/kg) or vehicle and body temperature
was maintained at 37.5◦C. Hyperthermia seizure induction
was then conducted (Dutton et al., 2013). Briefly, the body
temperature of each mouse was elevated by 0.5◦C every 2 min
until the first GTCS or 42.5◦C is reached. The temperature at
which the seizure occurred was recorded.
Chronic Hup A Treatment
The effect of chronic Hup A (0.5 and 1 mg/kg) administration
on susceptibility to 6 Hz-induced seizures was first examined
in male CF1 mice (N = 10/dose). On Day 0, all mice were
administered vehicle (i.p.) 1 h prior to 6 Hz seizure induction
(44 mA) to establish baseline seizure susceptibility. The mice
were then divided into 2 cohorts based on the dose of Hup A
administered. Cohort 1 mice received one injection per day of
Hup A (0.5 mg/kg, i.p.) for 7 consecutive days and were subjected
to 6 Hz seizure induction 1 h after Hup A administration on
Day 7. Cohort 2 mice received Hup A (1 mg/kg, i.p.) for 12
consecutive days and were subjected to 6 Hz seizure induction
1 h after Hup A administration on Days 7 and 12. Cohort 2 mice
then received Hup A (1.8 mg/kg, i.p.) for the next 5 consecutive
days (Days 13–17), and 6 Hz seizures were induced 1 h after Hup
A administration on Day 17. To determine the effect of chronic
Hup A administration on AChE activity, separate groups of mice
(N = 3/group) were administered Hup A (0.5 or 1 mg/kg) as
described above for Cohorts 1 and 2, and AChE activity was
quantified on Day 7 (to correspond with Cohort 1 mice) and Days
7 and 12 (to correspond with Cohort 2 mice).
We next determined the effect of chronic Hup A (1 mg/kg)
administration on susceptibility to 6 Hz-induced seizures in
male Scn1aRH/+ mutants (N = 9). On Day 0, all mice were
administered vehicle (i.p.) 1 h prior to seizure induction (24 mA)
to establish baseline seizure susceptibility. The mice were then
administered Hup A (i.p.) daily for 21 consecutive days and
subjected to 6 Hz seizure induction on Days 7, 14, and
21. The mice were also subjected to 6 Hz seizure induction
on Day 22 to determine whether Hup A conferred lasting
protection.
Statistical Analyses
A one-way repeated measures ANOVA (rANOVA) followed
by the Dunn’s multiple comparisons test (for non-parametric
data) was used to compare Racine scores (RS) following 6
Hz seizure induction in CF1 mice, Scn1a mutants, and their
respective WT littermates administered Hup A (0.10–1 mg/kg)
or vehicle. A one-way ANOVA followed by the Holm-Šídák’s
multiple comparisons test was used to compare latencies to
flurothyl-induced MJ and GTCS-HLE, percent AChE activity,
and temperature in CF1 mice administered vehicle or Hup A
(0.1–1.8 mg/kg). The chi-squared test was used to compare the
percent of deaths between vehicle- and Hup-A treated mice
following flurothyl seizure induction. An unpaired student’s t-test
was used to compare latencies to the MJ and GTCS following
PTZ administration. A two-way ANOVA was used to compare
the average temperature at seizure occurrence between Hup
A- and vehicle-treated Scn1a mutants and their respective WT
littermates during hyperthermia. A one-way rANOVA followed
by the Dunn’s multiple comparisons test was used to compare
RS following 6 Hz seizure induction in CF1 and Scn1aRH/+ mice
during chronic Hup A administration. All data are presented
as the mean ± SEM; p < 0.05 was considered statistically
significant.
RESULTS
Hup A Protects against Induced Seizures in
CF1 Mice
We first examined the relationship between Hup A dose (0.0–1.0
mg/kg) and resistance to seizures induced by the 6 Hz paradigm
at 44 mA. The administration of Hup A was randomized with
respect to the order in which each mouse received each dose of
Hup A and vehicle. Each mouse was subjected to 6 Hz seizure
induction once per week during the 6-week experimental period.
Behavioral seizure responses were consistent for each Hup A
dose, indicating that repeated seizure induction over the 6-
week period did not influence seizure susceptibility or severity.
Seizures were observed in all 12 vehicle-treated mice (1 RS1,
10 RS2, 1 RS3; Figure 1A), with most mice exhibiting forelimb
clonus and paw waving. However, seizure occurrence and
severity were significantly reduced following the administration
of 0.56 and 1 mg/kg Hup A, with seizures observed in only
4/12 and 1/12 mice, respectively (Figure 1A). This robust Hup
A-mediated protection against 6 Hz seizures was reproduced in
a separate group of CF1 mice that were administered Hup A
(1 mg/kg) or vehicle (N = 15/treatment, Figure 1B). As shown
in Figure 1B, RS2 and RS3 seizures were observed in all vehicle-
treated mice; however, 11/15 (74%) Hup A-treated CF1 mice were
completely protected (RS0).
We also evaluated the effect of Hup A (0.1–1.8 mg/kg) on
brain AChE activity 1 h after administration (Figure 1C). The
two lowest Hup A doses (0.1 and 0.18 mg/kg) resulted in ∼25%
reduction in AChE activity when compared to vehicle-injected
mice (p < 0.01). Hup A doses of 0.32–1.8 mg/kg resulted in
comparable reductions of AChE activity (63–78%; Figure 2).
Hup A doses of 0.56 or 1.0 mg/kg were selected for subsequent
analyses based on the magnitude of their effect on AChE activity
and the robust increase in seizure resistance associated with these
doses.
The ability of Hup A to protect against MES-induced seizures
was also examined in male CF1 mice. As expected, all vehicle-
treated mice experienced a maximal seizure. In contrast, all
CF1 mice treated with either 0.5 mg/kg or 1 mg/kg Hup A were

Huperzine A and Seizure Resistance
FIGURE 1 | Hup A protects against induced seizures in CF1 mice. (A) A ¼ log dose-response curve was generated to determine the relationship between Hup
A dose and resistance to 6 Hz-induced seizures in male CF1 mice (N = 12/dose). Hup A (0.10, 0.18, 0.32, 0.56, 1 mg/kg) or vehicle (10% CD) was administered (i.p.)
1 h prior to seizure induction at 44 mA. The greatest protection was observed with 0.56 and 1 mg/kg Hup A. (B) Robust protection against 6 Hz-induced seizures at

0.32, 0.56, 1.0, 1.8 mg/kg) or vehicle (10% CD) was administered (i.p.) to male CF1 mice (N = 3–4/dose) 1 h prior to sacrifice. The two lowest doses of Hup A (0.1
and 0.18 mg/kg) resulted in 25% reduction in AChE activity compared to vehicle. Hup A (0.32–1.8 mg/kg) caused 63–78% reduction in AChE activity. One-way

(1 mg/kg) significantly decreased the latency to the flurothyl-induced MJ compared to vehicle treated CF1 mice (unpaired Student’s t-test, p < 0.01, N =

protected. We next determined whether Hup A (1 mg/kg) was
capable of increasing resistance to PTZ-induced seizures in CF1
mice (Figures 1D,E). Average latencies to the first PTZ-induced
myoclonic jerk were significantly higher in Hup A-treated
mice compared to vehicle-treated mice (p < 0.01, Figure 1D).
Furthermore, only 2/6 Hup A-treated mice exhibited a GTCS,
whereas all (6/6) vehicle-treated mice had a GTCS (Figure 1E).
Of the mice that exhibited a GTCS, the latency to the initial GTCS
was significantly higher in the Hup A-treated mice compared to
mice administered vehicle (p < 0.01).
Contrary to the robust Hup A-mediated protection against
6 Hz, MES, and PTZ-induced seizures, average latencies to
the flurothyl-induced MJ was significantly lower in Hup A-
treated CF1 mice compared to vehicle-treated mice (Figure 1F,
p < 0.01). Hup A administration did not significantly change
the average latency to the GTCS-HLE (Figure 1G); however,
11/13 Hup A-treated mice died after the GTCS-HLE while all
vehicle-treated mice survived.
Transient dose-dependent side effects (e.g., hypothermia,
lethargy, fasiculations) were observed following acute Hup
A administration. Since hypothermia has been shown to be
neuroprotective and increases seizure resistance (Essman and
Sudak, 1964), we examined whether it might contribute to Hup
A-mediated seizure protection. To prevent the Hup A-induced
hypothermia, we maintained the body temperature of male
CF1 mice at 37.5◦C during the 1-h interval between Hup
A administration and seizure induction. Complete protection
against MES-induced seizures was still observed in these
mice, indicating that hypothermia does not contribute to Hup

Huperzine A and Seizure Resistance
FIGURE 2 | Hup A provides robust protection against 6 Hz-induced seizures in Scn1a mutants and wild-type (WT) littermates. (A,B) Hup A conferred
robust protection against 6 Hz-induced seizures (24 mA) in male Scn1aRH/+ mutants (N = 9–12/treatment) when administered at 0.5 mg/kg (A) and 1 mg/kg (B). (C)
Although not statistically significant, when the current was doubled to 48 mA, Hup A (1 mg/kg) reduced the number of Scn1aRH/+ mutants that seized and decreased
seizure severity when compared to vehicle-treated mutants. (D) Hup A (0.5 mg/kg) conferred robust seizure protection to male Scn1a+/− mutants and WT littermates
at 20 mA (N = 8–11/treatment/genotype). (E,F) Hup A (1 mg/kg) effectively increased resistance to 6 Hz-induced seizures in Scn1a+/− mutants and WT littermates at

and Scn1a+/− mutants and their respective WT littermates. As
previously described, mice were administered vehicle or Hup A
(0.5 and 1 mg/kg) 1 h prior to seizure induction.
Scn1aRH/+ Mutants
We first examined susceptibility to 6 Hz-induced seizures at a
current of 24 mA in Scn1aRH/+ mutants and WT littermates
administered either vehicle or Hup A (0.5 mg/kg). Seizures were
observed in 5/12 (4 RS1, 1 RS2) and 11/12 (2 RS2, 9 RS3)
vehicle-administered WT littermates and Scn1aRH/+ mutants,
respectively (Figure 2A). Following the administration of 0.5
mg/kg Hup A, all WT littermates were protected, while seizures
were observed in 5/12 (3 RS1, 1 RS2, 1 RS3) Scn1aRH/+ mutants
(Figure 2A). We next determined the effect of administering 1
mg/kg Hup A or vehicle under the same conditions (Figure 2B).
Seizures were observed in 5/12 (5 RS1) WT littermates and
11/12 (11 RS3) mutants that received vehicle. Following the
administration of 1 mg/kg Hup A, mild seizures (RS1) were
observed in 2/12 WT littermates and 2/12 Scn1aRH/+ mutants.
When the current was doubled (48 mA; Figure 2C), seizures were
observed in all vehicle-treated WT littermates and Scn1aRH/+
mutants (6 RS2, 3 RS3, both genotypes). In contrast, only
mild seizures (RS1) were observed in 3/9 WT littermates that
were treated with Hup A (1 mg/kg). Similarly, Hup A-treated
Scn1aRH/+ mutants had fewer and less severe seizures (3 RS1, 2
RS2) compared to those injected with vehicle, but this difference
was not statistically significant (Figure 2C).
Scn1a+/− Mutants
Susceptibility to 6 Hz-induced seizures was first examined in
Scn1a+/− mutants and WT littermates at 20 mA (Figure 2D)
following the administration of vehicle or Hup A (0.5 mg/kg).
Seizures were observed in all vehicle-treated WT littermates (11
RS2) and Scn1a+/− mutants (1 RS1, 9 RS2, 1 RS3). Following the
administration of 0.5 mg/kg Hup A, seizures were only observed
in 1/11 (1 RS3) WT littermates and 3/11 (2 RS1, 1 RS3) Scn1a+/−
mutants. We next determined the effect of administering 1 mg/kg
Hup A or vehicle under the same conditions (Figure 2E). All
vehicle-treated mice seized (WT, 6 RS2, 2 RS3; Scn1a+/−, 4 RS2, 4
RS3). In contrast, among the Hup A-treated mice, seizures were
only observed in 1/8 WT littermates (1 RS1) and 2/8 Scn1a+/−
mutants (1 RS1, 1 RS2). When the current was doubled to 40 mA
(Figure 2F), seizures were again observed in all vehicle-treated
WT littermates (8 RS2, 1 RS3) and Scn1a+/− mutants (3 RS2, 6

RS3); however, seizure severity was significantly reduced in the
Hup A-treated WT littermates (1 RS2) and Scn1a+/− mutants
(2 RS1, 4 RS2).
Hup A Protects against Maximal
Electroshock Seizures (MES)
The ability of Hup A to protect against MES-induced seizures was
examined in both sexes of Scn1a mutants and their respective
WT littermates (Table 1). As expected, all vehicle-treated mice
experienced a maximal seizure. Following the administration of
0.5 mg/kg Hup A, protection was observed in 5/9 male and
1/6 female Scn1aRH/+ mutants and 10/11 male and 2/6 female
WT littermates. Similarly, 5/10 male and 5/11 female Scn1a+/−
mutants and 8/9 male and 8/9 female WT littermates were
protected. More robust seizure protection was observed among
the mutant mice following the administration of 1 mg/kg Hup
A regardless of sex and genotype. Specifically, 6/7 male and 6/8
female Scn1aRH/+ mutants and all sex-matched WT littermates
were protected. Similarly, all Hup A-treated male Scn1a+/−
mutants and 6/7 male WT littermates were protected. Protection
was also observed in 6/9 Hup A-treated female Scn1a+/− mutants
and 9/10 female WT littermates.
Hup A Provides Robust Protection against
Hyperthermia-Induced Seizures in Scn1a
Mutant Mice
The ability of Hup A to protect against hyperthermia-induced
seizures was evaluated in Scn1a mutant mice and their respective
WT littermates. All vehicle-treated Scn1a mutants exhibited a
seizure. In contrast, WT littermates administered vehicle did
not exhibit a seizure in this paradigm. Hup A-treated WT
littermates responded similarly to the vehicle-treated WT mice.
Although all Hup A-treated Scn1aRH/+ and Scn1a+/− mutant
mice exhibited a seizure, the average temperature at seizure
occurrence was significantly higher than the temperature at
which the vehicle-treated mutants seized (Scn1aRH/+, p < 0.01;
Scn1a+/−, p < 0.001; Figure 3).
Resistance to 6 Hz-Induced Seizures Is
Maintained in Scn1aRH/+ Mice during
Chronic Hup A Administration
Having established that acute Hup A administration confers
robust
seizure
protection,
we
next
investigated
whether
protection would be maintained during chronic Hup A delivery.
We first examined the effect of daily Hup A administration
(0.5 or 1 mg/kg) on susceptibility to 6 Hz-induced seizures
in CF1 mice (Figures 4A,B). As previously observed, all mice
exhibited RS2 seizures prior to initiating Hup A treatment
(Day 0). Seizure response was next examined after 7 days of
Hup A administration. In contrast to observations following
acute treatment, no protection was observed in the mice that
received 0.5 mg/kg Hup A (Figure 4A). At the higher dose of
Hup A (1 mg/kg), robust protection was still seen after 7 days;
however, protection was not observed on Day 12 (Figure 4B).
To determine whether seizure protection in these mice could be
restored by increasing the daily dose of Hup A, 1.8 mg/kg Hup A
was administered for the next 5 consecutive days (Days 13–17).
On Day 13, we observed a statistically significant increase in
seizure protection when compared to Day 0; however, protection
was not observed on Day 17.
Chronic Hup A administration did not alter its effect on
AChE activity, with approximately a 60% reduction observed
after 7 days of 0.5 mg/kg and a 70% reduction after 7 and
12 days of 1 mg/kg (Figure 4C). Furthermore, the transient
side effects, including fasiculations, hypothermia, and lethargy,
diminished with continued administration. We also examined
the effect of chronic Hup A administration (1 mg/kg) on
susceptibility to 6 Hz-induced seizures in Scn1aRH/+ mice. At
baseline (Day 0), all vehicle-treated mutants (9/9) experienced a
severe seizure (6 RS2, 3 RS3, Figure 4D). However, we observed
complete protection against 6 Hz-induced seizures after 7, 14,
and 21 consecutive days of Hup A administration (p < 0.01).
To determine whether seizure protection would be maintained
after cessation of Hup A administration, 6 Hz seizures were
induced 24 h after the last Hup A injection (Day 22); however,
we found no significant difference between the seizure responses

protection.
Central Muscarinic and GABAA Receptors
Are Important for Hup A-Mediated
Protection against 6 Hz-Induced Seizures
To gain further insight into the mechanism of action of
Hup A, we examined the effect of blocking muscarinic
receptors, nicotinic receptors, or GABAA receptors on Hup
A-conferred resistance to 6 Hz seizures in CF1 mice. Mice were
co-administered Hup A (1 mg/kg) and each antagonist 1 h prior
to seizure induction, and seizure response was compared to
control mice that were injected with vehicle plus saline, vehicle
plus antagonist, and Hup A plus saline (Figure 5). Seizure
responses were comparable between control mice administered
vehicle plus saline and vehicle plus each antagonist, confirming
that the doses of the antagonists used did not alter seizure
response (Figure 5).
Block of central muscarinic receptors was achieved by
injection of the muscarinic receptor antagonist, scopolamine
hydrobromide (SH; Figure 5A). All control mice that received

vehicle and saline or vehicle and SH exhibited RS2 seizures.
These results also demonstrate that SH alone does not
worsen or ameliorate the behavioral seizure response. In
contrast to the seizure protection observed in the Hup A
plus saline group, all mice co-administered Hup A and SH
exhibited RS2 seizures, demonstrating a role for muscarinic
receptors in Hup A-mediated seizure protection. The seizure
response of mice administered Hup A and the GABAA
receptor antagonist PTZ were comparable to control mice that
received vehicle and saline or vehicle plus PTZ, indicating
that GABAA receptors also contribute to Hup A-mediated
seizure protection (Figure 5C). However, 4/12 mice administered
Hup A plus PTZ did not exhibit a seizure and 2/12
mice had mild seizures (RS1), raising the possibility that
blocking GABAA receptors only partially affects Hup A activity
(Figure 5C). In contrast, the nicotinic receptor antagonist
bupropion hydrochloride (BH) had no effect on Hup A
activity, as demonstrated by the comparable seizure response

of the Hup A plus saline and Hup A plus BH groups
(Figure 5E).
To determine whether these receptors were involved in
the Hup A-induced hypothermia, we also measured the body
temperature of the mice 1 h after drug administration. The
average body temperature of mice administered Hup A plus SH
was comparable to the control mice and was significantly higher
than the Hup A plus saline group (Figure 5B). Although the
higher body temperature observed in mice co-administered Hup
A and BH was statistically different from the Hup A plus saline
group (p < 0.05), the average body temperature in the presence of
BH was still significantly lower than the control mice (Figure 5F).
Average body temperature of mice co-administered Hup A and
PTZ was comparable to mice given Hup A and saline, suggesting
that GABAA receptors are not involved in the Hup A-mediated
hypothermia (p < 0.0001, Figure 5D).
DISCUSSION
A role for reversible AChE inhibitors in the treatment of epilepsy
has focused largely on seizures that are caused by exposure to
organophosphates (e.g., soman) that bind irreversibly to AChE.
Hup A has been shown to protect against seizures in rat (Tonduli
et al., 2001), guinea pig (Wang et al., 2013), and non-human
primate models (Lallement et al., 2002) of soman toxicity. In
addition, Coleman et al. (2008) reported that Hup A (the [+]
isomer) protects against NMDA-induced status epilepticus in
rats, and there is one case of Hup-mediated suppression of
complex partial seizures in a dog (Schneider et al., 2009). Hup
A (0.6 mg/kg) was also shown to protect against PTZ-induced
seizures in rats (Gersner et al., 2015). In a recent antiepileptic
drug screen using a zebrafish model of DS, Hup A (100–
1000 µM) did not protect against behavioral seizures; however,
it did protect against PTZ-induced seizures without toxic effects
(Dinday and Baraban, 2015).
We hypothesize, based on potential mechanisms of action
of Hup A and our findings, that it might be particularly
efficacious in epilepsy subtypes like DS that are caused by
reduced neuronal inhibition. Hup A administration directly
inhibits AChE, leading to an increase in brain acetylcholine
levels. Acetylcholine is known to act directly on muscarinic
receptors on GABAergic interneurons (Gonzalez et al., 2011),
thereby increasing neuronal inhibition and suppression of
hippocampal excitation (Pitler and Alger, 1992). Furthermore,
Hup A was found to increase intracortical inhibition as measured
by paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation, suggesting
that it works, in part, by increasing cortical GABAergic activity
(Gersner et al., 2015). Hup A is also known to have primarily
central effects (Gersner et al., 2015), which makes it a more
attractive reversible AChE inhibitor compared to others with
peripheral side effects or reduced penetrance across the blood-
brain barrier (e.g., pyridostigmine; Philippens et al., 1996).
Thus, given the underlying reduction in neuronal inhibition
(Yu et al., 2006; Ogiwara et al., 2007; Martin et al., 2010)
and the known role of the hippocampus in seizure generation
in DS (Liautard et al., 2013), the administration of Hup A
would be predicted to enhance endogenous GABAergic tone,
thereby normalizing the balance between neuronal inhibition
and excitation in patients with SCN1A mutations. Importantly,
likely because it augments endogenous GABA rather than being
a direct GABA agonist, Hup A has not been associated with the
side effects and risks of benzodiazepines, such as clonazepam,
including addiction and respiratory suppression, and therefore
may have advantages over GABA agonists and related drugs.
Furthermore, we expect the additional biological properties
of Hup A, including protection against inflammation (Wang
et al., 2008) and cell death (Hemendinger et al., 2008), and
increasing neurotrophic (Tang et al., 2005) and antioxidant (Xiao
et al., 2000) activity, will also be beneficial in the treatment of
epilepsy.
Huperzine A Provides Protection against 6
Hz-Induced Seizures
The 6 Hz seizure induction paradigm uses a 3-s, low-frequency
(6 Hz) current to produce a seizure that is less intense
and more focal compared to seizures generated by MES
and PTZ (Brown et al., 1953). In conjunction with c-
Fos immunohistochemistry, Barton et al. (2001) found that
different regions of the brain could be activated by varying
the intensity of the current used in the 6 Hz paradigm.
Lower intensities (22 and 32 mA; CC97 and 1.5xCC97 for
CF1 mice, respectively) activate the amygdala, cortices, and
entorhinal cortex, while a higher current (44 mA; 2xCC97)
activates the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. Based on these
findings, the 6 Hz seizure induction paradigm has been used
as a model of therapy-resistant limbic seizures (Barton et al.,
2001).
We found that 0.56 and 1 mg/kg of Hup A provided
robust protection against 6 Hz-induced seizures (44 mA) in
CF1 mice. Consistent with these results, we found that
both Hup A doses also provided seizure protection in the
Scn1a mutant mice. Interestingly, robust seizure protection
was still achieved in Scn1a mutants when the current was
doubled (48 mA for Scn1aRH/+ and 40 mA for Scn1a+/−),
suggesting that Hup A might also provide protection against
spontaneous seizures in DS that may initiate in the hippocampus
(Liautard et al., 2013).
Daily administration of Hup A (1 mg/kg) provided protection
against 6 Hz-induced seizures in CF1 mice for 7–12 days.
More importantly, we demonstrated in the Scn1aRH/+ mutants
that Hup A could be provided daily for at least 21 days
without loss of seizure protection. However, we did not observe
protection 24 h after cessation of treatment. Two potential
reasons for the observed differences in the effect of chronic Hup
A administration between the CF1 mice and the Scn1aRH/+
mutants are: (1) the different genetic backgrounds of each strain
and (2) the predicted increase in neuronal inhibition attributable
to Hup A might confer greater seizure protection in the mutants
due to the effect of the Scn1a mutation on the excitability of
inhibitory interneurons. These results make Hup A an attractive
therapeutic option for epilepsy since chronic treatment is often
necessary.

Huperzine A and Seizure Resistance
Huperzine A Provides Protection against
Maximal Electroshock Seizures
The MES paradigm uses a high-frequency current of short
duration (60 Hz, 50 mA, 0.2 ms) to produce a seizure that can
spread throughout the brain (Toman, 1951) as reflected in
c-Fos expression in distal structures, such as the midbrain
and brainstem (Barton et al., 2001). Drugs that can inhibit
seizure propagation are highly effective in the MES paradigm
(Woodbury and Esplin, 1959). Furthermore, compounds that are
effective against MES-induced seizures are found to clinically
block or mitigate generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCSs;
White et al., 1995). Valproate and topiramate, two AEDs
currently used in the treatment of DS (Shi et al., 2015), also
protect against MES-induced seizures. Our findings that Hup
A protects against MES-induced seizures in Scn1a mutants
suggest that it may provide protection by blocking seizure
propagation.
Huperzine A Provides Protection against
PTZ but Does Not Protect against
Flurothyl-Induced Seizures
Similar to 6 Hz and MES, we observed robust protection against
PTZ-induced seizures in CF1 mice. This was reflected by the
absence of a GTCS in 4 of 6 Hup A-treated mice and an
increase in average latencies to the MJ and GTCS (in the
mice that did exhibit a GTCS). These results are consistent
with the recent findings by Gersner et al. (2015), where Hup
A (0.6 mg/kg) was found to protect against PTZ-induced
seizures in rats. Similar to our results, a significantly lower
number of Hup A-treated rats (only 30%) exhibited a GTCS
compared to saline-treated rats (∼75%). PTZ seizure induction
is
routinely
used
for
screening
potential
anticonvulsants
in part because protection against PTZ-induced seizures is
predictive of efficacy in treating absence epilepsy (Krall et al.,
1978).
In contrast, following flurothyl exposure, we observed
a decrease in the average latency to the MJ and higher
mortality following the GTCS-HLE in Hup A-treated mice.
Seizure behavior and c-Fos immunoreactivity patterns have
been found to be similar following flurothyl and PTZ seizure
induction (Jensen et al., 1993), which are both mediated,
at least in part, by inhibition of GABAA receptors. The
ability of Hup A to provide protection against PTZ but
not flurothyl-induced seizures suggests the contribution of a
non-GABAergic component to the mechanism of action of
flurothyl. Finally, it is possible, since flurothyl is inhaled,
there may be peripheral effects elicited by both flurothyl
and Hup A that, when combined, worsens the seizure
phenotype.
Huperzine A Confers Robust Protection
against Hyperthermia-Induced Seizures in
Scn1a Mutant Mice
Infants with SCN1A mutations often experience severe and
prolonged febrile seizures (FSs) that can have a negative impact
on long-term prognosis (Wolff et al., 2006; Akiyama et al.,
2010). Currently, there are no routine clinical interventions
that can protect against early-life FSs. We and others have
demonstrated increased susceptibility to hyperthermia-induced
seizures in Scn1a mutant mice (Oakley et al., 2009; Dutton
et al., 2013). Although the mechanism underlying febrile seizure
generation is not fully understood, it has been demonstrated
that febrile seizures originate from the limbic region of the
brain, notably the amygdala and hippocampus (Dube et al.,
2000; Brewster et al., 2002). Consistent with the robust Hup
A-mediated protection against 6 Hz-induced seizures (a model
of limbic epilepsy), we observed a significant increase in the
temperature at which hyperthermia-induced seizures occurred
in Hup A-treated Scn1a mutant mice. Cao and others have
suggested that the temperature at seizure occurrence is a
good measure of drug efficacy as this index is reproducible
within the same mouse (Cao et al., 2012). Other drugs,
such as stiripentol, that have demonstrated clinical efficacy
in the treatment of SCN1A-derived epilepsy have also been
shown to increase resistance to hyperthermia-induced seizures
in Scn1a rodent models (Hayashi et al., 2011; Cao et al.,
2012).
Huperzine A and Inhibition of AChE Activity
Hup A-mediated inhibition of brain AChE is known to be dose
dependent and comparable across routes of administration. Tang
et al. (1989) found that Hup A (0.5–1 mg/kg) provided the
greatest inhibition of AChE throughout the entire brain (up to
42%), with the fewest side effects. Laganiere et al. (1991) found
that 0.5 mg/kg Hup A significantly reduced AChE activity in
the hippocampus, striatum, and septum (20–45%), whereas 0.1
mg/kg Hup A only slightly reduced AChE activity in these brain
regions. In Rhesus monkeys, Myers et al. (2010) also found that
Hup A (5–40 µg/kg) resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition
of AChE activity (31–74%) without adverse cognitive effects.
Although we found that Hup A doses of 0.32–1 mg/kg produced
similar reductions in AChE activity, which may indicate a floor
effect on AChE activity, more robust seizure protection was
observed with 0.56 and 1 mg/kg Hup A. We also observed similar
reductions in AChE activity regardless of whether Hup A was
administered acutely or chronically (Figure 5C). These findings
suggest that Hup A-mediated seizure protection is not dependent
solely on the level of AChE activity. In addition, previous studies
demonstrated that Hup A inhibition of AChE occurs significantly
faster than the corresponding increases in acetylcholine (Tang
et al., 1989).
Recently,
focal
seizures
(as
a
result
of
hippocampal
stimulation) were found to result in decreased subcortical
cholinergic neurotransmission both during and after a seizure
(Motelow et al., 2015). Decreased acetylcholine levels in the
thalamus have also been noted in partial seizures and slow-wave
sleep (Williams et al., 1994). Our findings that Hup A protects
against 6 Hz-induced seizures, a model of focal limbic seizures,
and the noted decreased cholinergic neurotransmission in focal
seizures (Motelow et al., 2015), suggest that Hup A may also be
efficacious in the treatment of TLE.

Huperzine A and Seizure Resistance
Potential Mechanisms for Hup A-Mediated
Seizure Protection
Elevated body temperature is known to induce epileptic activity
and seizures in animals, while hypothermia (29–34.5◦C) has
been shown to be anticonvulsant (Essman and Sudak, 1964).
We observed that upon acute administration of Hup A, mice
displayed transient side effects, including hypothermia. To
determine whether Hup A-induced hypothermia contributes to
seizure protection, we held the body temperature of mice at
37.5◦C for the 1 h interval between Hup A administration and
MES induction. Under these conditions, we found that Hup A-
induced hypothermia does not contribute to seizure protection.

receptors
that
may be involved in Hup A-mediated seizure protection, we
co-administered Hup A and receptor antagonists 1 h prior to
6 Hz seizure induction. Atropine, a competitive muscarinic
receptor antagonist that targets receptors in both the central
and peripheral nervous systems, has been demonstrated (at
30 mg/kg) to block the protective effects of Hup A in the 6 Hz
paradigm (Bialer et al., 2015). However, Gersner et al. (2015)
found that co-administration of atropine (30 mg/kg) and Hup
A did not block the magnitude of paired-pulse inhibition,
suggesting that muscarinic receptors are not involved in Hup
A-mediated cortical interneuron activation. We found that the
co-administration of scopolamine hydrobromide, a centrally
acting muscarinic receptor antagonist, blocked Hup A-mediated
protection against 6 Hz-induced seizures. We also found that
the co-administration of PTZ, a GABAA receptor antagonist,
also partially blocks Hup A-mediated protection in the 6
Hz paradigm. However, the co-administration of a nicotinic
receptor antagonist did not block Hup A-mediated seizure
protection. These results suggest that Hup A may provide seizure
protection through the activation of several pathways, including
the muscarinic and GABAA receptors.
Increases in acetylcholine have been shown to decrease body
temperature in both humans (Cushing, 1931) and rodents
(Everett, 1956) by acting upon interneurons in the hypothalamic
thermoregulatory zone. Our results demonstrate that Hup
A-induced hypothermia involves both muscarinic and nicotinic
cholinergic receptors. Co-administration of Hup A and the
muscarinic receptor antagonist, SH, resulted in the maintenance
of normal body temperature. Although co-administration of
the nicotinic receptor antagonist, BH, partially prevented the
decrease in body temperature observed in Hup A plus saline-
injected mice, the average body temperature of Hup A plus BH
mice was still significantly lower than control mice. Our findings
suggest that Hup A-induced hypothermia is mediated primarily
by the muscarinic cholinergic receptor.
CONCLUSION
We demonstrated that Hup A increased the resistance of
Scn1a+/− and Scn1aRH/+ mutant mice to seizures induced
by MES, 6 Hz, hyperthermia, and PTZ. In addition, seizure
protection conferred by Hup A is maintained during chronic
administration. Taken together, our findings highlight the
therapeutic potential of Huperzine A in increasing seizure
resistance in SCN1A-derived epilepsy and potentially other forms
of refractory epilepsy. Further studies on the ability of Hup A to
reduce spontaneous seizure frequency and severity are therefore
warranted.
