Hypertension is an important modifiable risk factor for 
cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and hypertension 
in adolescents and young adults is associated with long-term 
negative health effects (1,2).* In 2017, the American Academy 
of Pediatrics (AAP) released a new Clinical Practice Guideline 
(3), which updated 2004 pediatric hypertension guidance† 
with new thresholds and percentile references calculated from a 
healthy-weight population. To examine trends in youth hyper-
tension and the impact of the new guideline on classification 
of hypertension status, CDC analyzed data from 12,004 par-
ticipants aged 12–19 years in the 2001–2016 National Health 
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). During this 
time, prevalence of hypertension declined, using both the 
new (from 7.7% to 4.2%, p<0.001) and former (from 3.2% 
to 1.5%, p<0.001) guidelines, and declines were observed 
across all weight status categories. However, because of the 
new percentile tables and lower threshold for hypertension 
(4), application of the new guideline compared with the for-
mer guideline resulted in a weighted net estimated increase of 
795,000 U.S. youths being reclassified as having hypertension 
using 2013–2016 data. Youths who were older, male, and those 
with obesity accounted for a disproportionate share of persons 
reclassified as having hypertension. Clinicians and public 
health professionals might expect to see a higher prevalence 
of hypertension with application of the new guideline and 
can use these data to inform actions to address hypertension 
among youths. Strategies to improve cardiovascular health 
include adoption of healthy eating patterns and increased 
physical activity (3).
NHANES is a nationally representative survey of noninsti-
tutionalized persons in the United States. The survey includes 
an in-person examination with up to three brachial systolic 
blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) 
readings taken by certified examiners. Mean SBP and DBP 
values were used.§ Among 13,523 participating youths during

§ A maximum of three blood pressure readings were measured for each participant 
in the Mobile Examination Center under a standard protocol. For participants 
with only a single BP reading, that measurement was used in place of an average.

Manual_2013.pdf.
2001–2016, those missing SBP or DBP (999), or body mass 
index (BMI [kg/m2]) (136) were excluded. In addition, youths 
classified as underweight (BMI-for-age <5th percentile; 384) 
were excluded because of insufficient sample size, leaving 
12,004 persons aged 12–19 years in the analytic sample.
Elevated blood pressure (BP) and hypertension were defined 
according to age-specific thresholds established in both the 
former and new guidelines. To apply the former guideline, 
among those aged 12–17 years, elevated BP (formerly “prehy-
pertension”) was defined as BP ≥90th to <95th percentile or 
≥120/80 mmHg to <95th percentile; hypertension was defined 
as BP ≥95th percentile (using 2004 age, sex, and height-specific 
percentile tables) or reported antihypertensive medication use 
(only available for persons aged >15 years¶) (Supplementary 
Table 1, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/56579). Among 
persons aged 18–19 years, elevated BP was defined as SBP 
≥120 mmHg to <140 mmHg or DBP ≥80 mmHg to 
<90 mmHg; hypertension was defined as BP ≥140/90 mmHg 
or reported antihypertensive medication use.
The new guideline used new percentile tables (from a refer-
ence population excluding youths with overweight/obesity). To 
apply the new guideline, among adolescents aged 12–17 years, 
elevated BP was defined as BP ≥90th to <95th percentile or 
SBP ≥120 mmHg to <95th percentile; hypertension was 
defined as BP ≥95th percentile, BP ≥130/80 mmHg, or 
reported antihypertensive medication use. For persons aged 
18–19 years, elevated BP was defined as SBP ≥120 mmHg to 
<130 mmHg and DBP <80 mmHg; hypertension was defined 
as BP ≥130/80 mmHg or antihypertensive medication use. The 
new guideline thresholds for persons aged 18–19 years align 
¶ From NHANES Prescription Medication dataset, unpublished. The definition 
of hypertension used in this analysis did not include medications identified as 
being antihypertensives in the Prescription Medication dataset (in which 
interviewers asked to see all prescription medication containers for medications 
that the participant had taken within 30 days), because some of these 
medications might not have been taken for the purpose of controlling 
hypertension. Hypertension in this analysis only included self-reported 
antihypertensive use from the Blood Pressure and Cholesterol Module (e.g., 
“Because of your high blood pressure/hypertension, have you ever been told to 
take prescribed medicine?”). However, use of medications identified as being 
antihypertensives in the Prescription Medication dataset increased from 2001 
to 2014, the last year for which this dataset was available.

Weight status was categorized using age- and sex-specific 
reference values from the 2000 CDC growth charts†† (healthy 
weight: BMI-for-age ≥5th to <85th percentiles; overweight: 
≥85th to <95th; obesity: ≥95th). In addition, a subset of the 
group with obesity (severe obesity, defined as BMI-for-age 
≥120% of the 95th percentile) was examined (5). Race/ethnic-
ity was classified as non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, 
Mexican American, and other.§§
Participant characteristics across survey years were compared 
using Satterthwaite chi-squared tests and t-tests. Estimated 
prevalence of elevated BP
, hypertension, and the combina-
tion of these were calculated in 4-year increments (to assure 
sufficient sample size) from 2001 to 2016, and trends were 
assessed using survey logistic regression adjusted for age, sex, 
and race/ethnicity. Using prevalence estimates from 2013 to

§§ During 1999–2006, certain groups, including Mexican Americans, were 
oversampled, while the number of non-Mexican American Hispanics in the 
NHANES sample was too small for reliable estimates. Because of these 
sampling differences and sample size concerns, it is not recommended to 
examine “all Hispanics” from years before 2007. Hispanics other than Mexican 
Americans were included in the “other” category. https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/
data/nhanes/analyticnote_2007-2010.pdf.
2016, population-level estimates of the number of youths 
classified as having hypertension were calculated. Bootstrap 
methodology with 1,000 resamples was used to estimate 95% 
confidence intervals for the percentage of the population reclas-
sified as having hypertension. All analyses used exam sample 
weights and statistical procedures for complex surveys, and all 
tests were two-sided.
Population characteristics were mostly consistent from 2001 
to 2016, although the prevalence of obesity increased from 
17.8% (2001–2004) to 21.8% (2013–2016) (p = 0.016), as 
did the prevalence of severe obesity (5.7% to 8.8%, p = 0.003) 
(Table 1). During 2001–2016, the prevalence of hypertension 
declined, according to both the new (from 7.7% to 4.2%, 
p<0.001) and former (from 3.2% to 1.5%, p<0.001) guidelines 
(Figure) (Supplementary Table 2, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/
cdc/56580). This decline occurred across all BMI categories, 
although the prevalence of hypertension was consistently 
highest among persons with obesity and severe obesity. During 
2013–2016, using the new guideline, the prevalence of elevated 
BP was approximately 10%, and the prevalence of combined 
elevated BP or hypertension was nearly 15% (Figure).
Compared with the former guideline, the new guideline 
classified fewer youths with elevated BP and more youths as 
having hypertension (Figure). Using data from 2013 to 2016, 
an additional 2.6% of U.S. youths aged 12–19 years would be 
reclassified as having hypertension, which translates to a net 
increase of approximately 795,000 persons (Table 2). Youths 
aged 18–19 years would account for approximately half of the

half of the net increase in new diagnoses of hypertension among 
youths would be among those with obesity (Table 2), although 
less than one quarter of U.S. youths have obesity (Table 1).
Discussion
According to the criteria of the 2017 AAP Clinical Practice 
Guideline, approximately one in seven U.S. youths aged 
12–19 years had elevated BP or hypertension during 2013–
2016. Prevalence of hypertension varied by weight status, 
ranging from 2% among healthy-weight youths to nearly 14% 
among those with severe obesity. The new guideline used a 
lower threshold of hypertension and new percentile references, 
and compared with the former guideline, the new guideline 
would reclassify 2.6% of U.S. youths, or nearly an additional 
800,000, as having hypertension.
The application of the new guideline results in a net increase 
in the number of persons aged 12–19 years classified as having 
hypertension. Early screening (3) and intervention should be 
encouraged. Hypertension among youths is associated with 
increased risk for hypertension and other markers of cardio-
vascular risk during adulthood (1,2); however, if children 
with hypertension can achieve normal BP by adulthood, this 
risk might be reduced (1). Despite significant increases in the 
prevalence of obesity and severe obesity from 2001–2004 to 
2013–2016, the prevalence of hypertension declined signifi-
cantly (3.5 percentage points) across this time. This decline in 
adolescent hypertension is consistent with other reports (6,7), 
and might be related to improved diet quality or improved 
screening and earlier lifestyle or pharmacologic intervention 
(8,9). Increases in antihypertensive medication use, and subse-
quent decreases in BP
, might have partially contributed to the 
observed declines in hypertension. Information on medication 
use was not available for participants aged 12–15 years and 
thus could not be included in the definition of hypertension 
for this age group. In addition, there appeared to be an increase 
in antihypertensive medication use based on review of the 
participants’ actual medications, both among youths who self-
reported medication use for BP control and were collected in 
the definition of hypertension, and among youths who did not 
self-report medication use for BP control and were not included 
in the definition of hypertension. Although antihypertensive, 
or BP-lowering, medications are primarily used to manage 
hypertension, they can also be used for other cardiovascular 
conditions, migraines, or anxiety. Declines in adolescent

hypertension prevalence should be interpreted with caution, 
as the underlying causes of the decline are uncertain (7).
The findings in this report are subject to at least three addi-
tional limitations. First, surveys such as NHANES are subject 
to selection and response bias, which might affect the accuracy 
of national estimates, despite use of weights and survey pro-
cedures. Second, multiple BP measurements were taken on 
a single day, rather than spread over two or more visits as is 
recommended for diagnosis (3). Finally, self-reported medica-
tion use data are subject to recall bias.
Reducing hypertension prevalence among youths is a 
Healthy People 2020 objective (HDS-5.2).¶¶ Lifestyle inter-
ventions for youths with elevated BP or hypertension include 
increased physical activity and adoption of healthy eating pat-
terns such as the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension 
(DASH) diet (3). Sodium reduction in the food supply and 
promotion of physical activity in communities and schools 
are population strategies for improving cardiovascular health

(10). Pediatricians, family physicians, public health profession-
als, policy makers, parents, and schools can all be involved in 
efforts to address hypertension in the adolescent population.
Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Elevated blood pressure during adolescence is associated with 
cardiovascular risk in adulthood. In 2017, the American 
Academy of Pediatrics released a new guideline that changed 
the criteria for diagnosing hypertension.
What is added by this report?
Using the new guideline, an estimated 800,000 additional youths 
aged 12–19 years (especially older youths, males, and those with 
obesity) would be reclassified as having hypertension during 
2013–2016, compared with using the former guideline.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Clinicians and researchers transitioning to the new guideline 
might expect more youths to be classified as having hyperten-
sion. Efforts to address hypertension in youths include lifestyle 
and environmental strategies that promote cardiovascular health.
