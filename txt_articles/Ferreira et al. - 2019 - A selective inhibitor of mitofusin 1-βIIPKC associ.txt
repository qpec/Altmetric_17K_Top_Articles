We previously demonstrated that beta II protein kinase C (βIIPKC) activity is elevated in
failing hearts and contributes to this pathology. Here we report that βIIPKC accumulates on
the mitochondrial outer membrane and phosphorylates mitofusin 1 (Mfn1) at serine 86. Mfn1
phosphorylation results in partial loss of its GTPase activity and in a buildup of fragmented
and dysfunctional mitochondria in heart failure. βIIPKC siRNA or a βIIPKC inhibitor mitigates
mitochondrial fragmentation and cell death. We confirm that Mfn1-βIIPKC interaction alone is
critical in inhibiting mitochondrial function and cardiac myocyte viability using SAMβA, a
rationally-designed peptide that selectively antagonizes Mfn1-βIIPKC association. SAMβA
treatment protects cultured neonatal and adult cardiac myocytes, but not Mfn1 knockout
cells, from stress-induced death. Importantly, SAMβA treatment re-establishes mitochondrial
morphology and function and improves cardiac contractility in rats with heart failure, sug-
gesting that SAMβA may be a potential treatment for patients with heart failure.

espite advances in clinical and pharmacological inter-
ventions, acute myocardial infarction with subsequent left
ventricular dysfunction and heart failure continues to be a
major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide1,2. Therefore,
the identification of novel therapeutic targets that improve car-
diac function in patients with myocardial infarction-induced
heart failure remains a major priority.
Protein kinases are key players in cellular signaling3. They
work as intracellular nodes where signals converge to and serve as
multi-effector triggers and/or brakes. Through phosphorylation
of specific substrates, protein kinases can regulate a wide array of
intracellular pathways that control cardiac metabolism, con-
tractility, remodeling, and survival. Therefore, they are attractive
molecular targets for cardiovascular diseases. However, the vast
majority of protein kinase inhibitors targets its ATP binding
pocket, a highly conserved region across the kinome, and often
induces
cardiotoxicity
by
inhibiting
unintended
kinases4,5.
Moreover, regardless of its upstream signaling, the same protein
kinase can activate multiple signaling pathways simultaneously
(essential and detrimental) during disease progression and
therefore affect the effectiveness and safety of PKC inhibitors in
the long-term. The screen or design of molecules that competi-
tively disrupt a specific protein–protein interaction (kinase-sub-
strate) has been considered an important approach to develop
more feasible drugs that selectively affect only detrimental kinase-
substrate interactions in cardiac pathophysiology5–7.
Protein kinase C (PKC) is a family of closely related serine-
threonine protein kinases involved in a variety of acute and
chronic cardiovascular diseases (i.e., ischemia-reperfusion injury,
hypertension, and heart failure)8. We have previously demon-
strated that treatment of isolated hearts, rodents, or humans with
rational design peptides that inhibit protein–protein interaction
between a specific PKC and its anchor protein protects the heart
against acute ischemic injuries9,10. We have also demonstrated
that activation of beta II PKC (βIIPKC), but not other PKCs,
contributes to heart failure pathophysiology in rodents11,12.
Likewise, βIIPKC activity is elevated in human failing hearts11.
More recently, we provided evidence that a rationally designed
peptide against βIIPKC, βIIV5-3, improves cardiac function in rats
with
hypertension-induced
or
post-myocardial
infarction-
induced heart failure12,13. This peptide inhibits all βIIPKC
activities (referred to as a global βIIPKC inhibitor in this paper).
Here, we use the global βIIPKC inhibitor to identify mitofusin
1 (Mfn1) as a downstream βIIPKC substrate involved in heart
failure progression. Mfn1 is a ubiquitous and well-conserved
GTPase responsible for regulating mitochondrial dynamics and
bioenergetics. We show that βIIPKC associates with Mfn1. Using
a rationally designed peptide that selectively antagonizes Mfn1-
βIIPKC association (SAMβA), we determine the contribution of
Mfn1-βIIPKC interaction and the resulting phosphorylation of
Mfn1 to mitochondrial morphology and bioenergetics and to the
pathology associated with heart failure. Our study provides evi-
dence that inhibition of excessive Mfn1-βIIPKC interaction and
the resulting mitochondrial fragmentation and dysfunction are
critical to heart failure-associated pathophysiology.
Results
βIIPKC activation mediates mitochondrial fragmentation in
heart failure. βIIPKC activation contributes to heart failure
pathophysiology14. However, the molecular mechanisms involved
in this process, including the identification of critical substrates
that are phosphorylated by this pleiotropic enzyme are not
known. As we demonstrated before11, blocking protein–protein
interaction between βIIPKC and its anchor protein (RACK1) with
βIIV5-3 (the global inhibitor of βIIPKC15) improved isolated
cardiomyocyte and whole heart contractility properties as well as
cardiac remodeling in rats with myocardial infarction-induced
heart failure (Fig. 1a–d; Supplementary Table 1). In these studies,
rats were treated for six weeks with βIIV5-3 at 3 mg per Kg per day
(a dose that we previously showed to be optimal11) in a sustained
fashion using an Alzet pump implanted under the skin on the
back of the animal. Treatment commenced after heart failure was
established, 4 weeks after left descending coronary artery ligation
to induce myocardial infarction (Fig. 1a). Control rats (sham
group) were submitted to the same surgical procedure, but
without left descending coronary artery ligation.
Using transmission electron microscopy, we noticed that the
inhibition of global βIIPKC activity had a prominent impact on
cardiac mitochondrial number and size in heart failure (Fig. 1e, f).
Failing hearts accumulated smaller and spherical (fragmented)
mitochondria compared to the sham group, resulting in increased
mitochondrial number to size ratio (Fig. 1e, f). These changes
correlated with increased outer mitochondrial membrane pro-
teins, but not the electron transport chain subunits, in failing
hearts (Supplementary Figure 1a-c). Sustained inhibition of global
βIIPKC activity using the βIIV5-3 peptide at 3 mg per Kg per day
re-established mitochondrial number to size ratio in rats with
heart failure as compared to sham rats (Fig. 1e, f). These findings
demonstrate
that
βIIPKC
activation
causes
mitochondrial
fragmentation in heart failure. Sustained global inhibition of
βIIPKC activity had no impact on mitochondrial DNA levels and
markers of mitophagy in heart failure (Supplementary Figure 1a,
d, e). Neither cardiac function nor mitochondrial number to size
ratio were affected by chronic treatment with peptide βIIV5-3 in
Sham animals (Supplementary Figure 2).
Next, we demonstrated that only βIIPKC among different PKC
isozymes accumulated in the mitochondrial fraction in failing rat
hearts (Fig. 1g, h). RACK1, the βIIPKC anchoring protein16 also
accumulated in the mitochondrial fraction of failing hearts
(Fig. 1g, h). Moreover, blocking βIIPKC-RACK1 interaction
using βIIV5-3 peptide was sufficient to reduce βIIPKC levels in the
mitochondrial fraction in heart failure (Fig. 1g, h). To determine
whether βIIPKC is located at the outer mitochondrial membrane
or inside mitochondria, we incubated isolated cardiac mitochon-
dria with proteinase K (5 μg mL−1) for 15 min in isotonic
mitochondrial buffer. Proteinase K completely degraded βIIPKC
and Tom20 (a protein located in the outer mitochondrial
membrane), but not ALDH2 (an enzyme located in the matrix)
(Fig. 1i). These findings demonstrated that, in failing rat hearts,
βIIPKC accumulates and binds to RACK1, as a result of βIIPKC
activation17, in the outer mitochondrial membrane.
Next, we validated our in vivo findings using neonatal cardiac
myocyte cultures. Treatment of neonatal cardiac myocytes with
angiotensin II for 4 h caused mitochondrial fragmentation, which
was prevented by a concomitant treatment with the global
βIIPKC inhibitor, βIIV5-3 (Fig. 2a–c). The treatment also
prevented mitochondrial accumulation of βIIPKC that was
induced by either angiotensin II or ceramide (Fig. 2d); these
stressors are hallmarks of heart failure in humans18,19 that cause
mitochondrial fragmentation in cardiomyocytes20,21.

mitochondrial biology and cell survival, βIIPKC was silenced

and

 treatment with βIIV5-3 also protected adult cardiomyocytes from
oxidative stress (a known trigger of mitochondrial fragmenta-
tion22) (Fig. 2g, h), similar to what we found in neonatal
cardiomyocytes. These findings demonstrate that suppressing
βIIPKC is sufficient to protect both neonatal and adult cardiac
myocytes against oxidative stress-induced mitochondrial frag-
mentation and dysfunction.

 absolute (H2O2) and relative (H2O2:O2) hydrogen peroxide
release in isolated mitochondria from heart failure rats. Failing
hearts displayed a significant reduction in the efficiency of
mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation compared to hearts
from sham operated rats, as measured by respiratory control ratio
(RCR, state 3: state 4; Fig. 3a). This response was mainly due to a
reduction of State 3 respiratory rate (Fig. 3b) and basal respiration
(State 2, Supplementary Figure 3a), while respiration in the
absence of oxidative phosphorylation (State 4) was unaffected in
these failing rat hearts (Supplementary Figure 3a). Moreover,
these failing hearts had elevated mitochondrial State 2 (basal,
Supplementary Figure 3a) and State 3 (oxygen consumption rate
maximized by the addition of ADP, Fig. 3c) H2O2 release
compared to hearts from the sham group. These changes were
maximized when H2O2 was normalized by oxygen consumption
rates (Fig. 3d, Supplementary Figure 3a), providing evidence of a
tight connection between mitochondrial oxygen consumption
and reactive oxygen species release in heart failure.
We next determined the effect of the global βIIPKC inhibition
on
mitochondrial
bioenergetics
in
heart
failure.
Sustained
inhibition of βIIPKC activity with βIIV5-3 improved the efficiency
of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (Fig. 3a), mainly by
preserving State 3 respiratory rate in heart failure (Fig. 3b).
Moreover, mitochondria isolated from heart failure animals
treated with the global βIIPKC inhibitor displayed reduced H2O2
and H2O2:O2 release when compared to TAT-treated (control)
heart failure animals (Fig. 3c, d). These findings suggest that
inhibiting βIIPKC accumulation in the outer mitochondrial
membrane is associated with the increase of mitochondrial
oxygen consumption and reduced excessive mitochondrial H2O2
release in rats with heart failure. Next, we determined how
βIIPKC affects mitochondrial biology in heart failure.
βIIPKC interacts with and inhibits Mfn1 activity. Mitochon-
drial number and size are tightly regulated by fusion and fission,
in a process termed mitochondrial dynamics. Because heart fail-
ure is associated with excessive mitochondrial fragmentation, we
hypothesized that elevated βIIPKC levels on the outer mito-
chondrial membrane resulted in phosphorylation of proteins that
regulate fusion or fission. We first determined the levels and
activity of the main GTPases involved in mitochondrial dynamics
in the heart. Only the levels of Mfn1 (a mitochondrial fusion-
related enzyme) were elevated in cardiac mitochondria during
heart failure (Fig. 3e), yet its GTPase activity was significantly
reduced as compared to the sham group (Fig. 3f), suggesting
accumulation of dysfunctional Mfn1 in heart failure. βIIPKC
inhibition by βIIV5-3 selectively re-established cardiac Mfn1 levels
and activity in heart failure, without affecting the level or activity
of mitofusin 2 (Mfn2, Fig. 3e, f).
Given that βIIPKC and Mfn1 accumulated on the outer
mitochondria membrane during heart failure, and that blocking
global βIIPKC activity reduced mitochondrial Mfn1 levels and re-
established the mitochondrial number to size ratio, we next
determined whether βIIPKC and Mfn1 form a complex. Analysis
of anti-Mfn1 immunoprecipitates by immunoblotting with anti-
βIIPKC antibody demonstrated an increased association of
βIIPKC with Mfn1 in cardiac mitochondria isolated from rats
with heart failure (Fig. 3g, top panel). In reciprocal experiments,
immunoblot analysis of anti-βIIPKC immunoprecipitates with
anti-Mfn1 antibody confirmed the interaction (Fig. 3g, middle
panel). No change in cardiac βIIPKC-Mfn2 interaction was seen
in heart failure (Supplementary Figure 1f). Confirming a role for
Mfn1 in βIIPKC association with the mitochondria, in Mfn1-null
MEFs (mouse embryonic fibroblasts) mitochondrial βIIPKC
levels were lower as compared to WT MEFs (Fig. 3h). However,
Mfn1 is not essential for mitochondrial accumulation of βIIPKC
upon stimulation with 10 nM phorbol ester 12-myristate 13-
acetate (PMA, an activator of most PKC isozymes11).
Next, we determined the functional impact of βIIPKC on
Mfn1. Immunoblot analysis of anti-Mfn1 immunoprecipitates
with
anti-serine/threonine
antibody
revealed
an
increased
phosphorylation at the molecular size of Mfn1 in heart failure
samples (Fig. 3g, middle panel) that was reduced by inhibiting
βIIPKC activity with βIIV5-3. Co-immunoprecipitation experi-
ments demonstrated that recombinant βIIPKC interacts with
recombinant Mfn1 (Fig. 4a) and active βIIPKC (with PS/DG/
Ca+2), but not inactive βIIPKC or its alternative splicing βIPKC,
phosphorylated Mfn1 [measured by incorporation of radiolabeled
P32-ATP] (Fig. 4b). Finally, as expected from our findings in
whole hearts, active recombinant βIIPKC (and not active βIPKC)
significantly reduced the GTPase activity of the recombinant
Mfn1 in this in vitro assay (Fig. 4c).
Mass spectrometry analysis of the in vitro phosphorylation
products identified S86, S284, and S290 in the Mfn1 GTPase
domain to be the βIIPKC phosphorylated sites (Fig. 4d). A serine-
to-alanine substitution demonstrated that S86A, but not S284A or
S290A, was sufficient to protect MEFs against βIIPKC activation-
induced cytotoxicity (Fig. 4e), suggesting S86 as a critical site to
induce
βIIPKC-mediated
Mfn1
inactivation.
Mfn1
S86
is
conserved in many species and it is not present in Mfn2 (another
critical mitofusin involved in mitochondrial dynamics; Fig. 4d).
Collectively, these findings suggest that phosphorylation of Mfn1
by βIIPKC at S86 inhibits its GTPase activity and increases
cytotoxicity.
Design of selective inhibitor of Mfn1-βIIPKC association. Our
in vivo and in vitro data provide evidence that Mfn1 phosphor-
ylation and consequent inhibition of its GTPase activity by
βIIPKC is associated with impaired mitochondrial morphology
and oxidative capacity. However, in addition to Mfn1, βIIPKC
phosphorylates many other substrates. To determine whether
inhibition of Mfn1-βIIPKC interaction alone is sufficient to

 prevent accumulation of fragmented and dysfunctional mito-
chondria upon stress, we developed a peptide that selectively
antagonizes Mfn1-βIIPKC association, termed SAMβA.
We have previously shown that two proteins that interact
usually share short sequences of homology that represent sites of
both
inter-
and
intra-molecular
interactions17,23,24.
More
recently, we described a similar rational approach to develop
PKC inhibitors that selectively block interaction and phosphor-
ylation of only one protein substrate of these multi-substrate
kinases6,7,25. Using the same approach, we rationally designed
SAMβA. First, we used sequence alignment software26 to identify
Mfn1-like sequence in βIIPKC (Fig. 5a).
The βIIPKC/Mfn1 homologous sequences, highlighted in color
in Fig. 5a in the crystal structure of Mfn1 (5GOM) and βPKC
(3PFQ), appear to be exposed α-helixes in the proteins and thus,
likely accessible for protein–protein interaction (Fig. 5b). To help
stabilize the α-helix structure, we added two amino acids at the C-
terminus of each peptide. We reasoned that if these sequences are
important for the protein–protein interaction between βIIPKC
and Mfn1, they should be conserved across species. Indeed,
RNAENFDRF is conserved in βIIPKC, but not in its alternative
splicing βIPKC (Fig. 5c, d). Conversely, NELENFTKQ is
conserved in Mfn1, but not in the homologous Mfn2 protein
(Fig. 5e, f). A BLAST search of the human genome identified four
other proteins with homologous sequences. However, these
sequences were not evolutionarily conserved (Fig. 5g; Supple-
mentary
Table
2),
except
in
αPKC
(Fig.
5g).
However,
mitochondrial αPKC levels were not changed in failing hearts
compared to sham animals (Fig. 1g). Together these data suggest
a
specific
role
for
RNAENFDRF
for
βIIPKC
and
Mfn1
protein–protein interaction.
Next, we synthesized the peptide RNAENFDRF (SAMβA) and
conjugated it to the cell penetrating TAT protein-derived peptide,
TAT47–5727, and determined its effect in protecting MEFs against
oxidative stress-induced cytotoxicity. Four other peptides related
to protein–protein interaction derived from either βIIPKC or

Oxidative stress was induced by treating cells with H2O2. Only
SAMβA (derived from βIIPKC), but not P255, derived from
Mfn1, or P251–254 control peptides, was effective in mitigating
oxidative stress-induced cytotoxicity (Fig. 5h, i upper panel).

 from antimycin A, an inhibitor of the mitochondrial electron
transport chain (Fig. 5h, i lower panel).
Given that mitochondrial Mfn1 phosphorylation and inhibi-
tion by βIIPKC is associated with accumulation of fragmented/
dysfunctional mitochondria and oxidative stress in failing hearts,
we next determined the effect of the SAMβA peptide on
mitochondrial morphology in cardiac myocytes. Treatment of
cultured neonatal cardiac myocytes with SAMβA prevented
mitochondrial fragmentation triggered by angiotensin II (Fig. 5j).
SAMβA reduced the excessive association of βIIPKC with Mfn1
induced by angiotensin II in cardiac myocytes, as measured by
co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 5k). Finally, the treatment of
cardiac neonatal myocytes with SAMβA had a better effect in
protecting against H2O2-induced metabolic dysfunction when
compared to the global βIIPKC inhibitor, βIIV5-3 (Fig. 5l).
SAMβA treatment improves heart failure outcome in rats. To
investigate the contribution of Mfn1-βIIPKC interaction to the
pathophysiology of heart failure, we delivered the SAMβA peptide
(or its control peptide, TAT) to rats with myocardial infarction-
induced heart failure; the peptides were delivered in a sustained
fashion at 3 mg per kg per day, using subcutaneously implanted
Alzet pumps. Treatments were commenced 4 weeks after myo-
cardial infarction and lasted 6 weeks (from 4 to 10 after inducing
myocardial infarction; Fig. 6a). This 6-week treatment with
SAMβA resulted in a significant increase of cardiac function
(measured by ventricular ejection fraction) compared to TAT-
treated (control) heart failure animals (Fig. 6b). SAMβA treat-
ment also decreased left ventricular end-diastolic diameter
(LVEDd) as compared to control heart failure group (Fig. 6c;
Supplementary Table 3). The better cardiac function following
SAMβA treatment was likely due to improved integrity of cardiac
myofibril and mitochondria structures, as evidenced by trans-
mission electron microscopy (Fig. 6d); sustained SAMβA treat-
ment prevented the accumulation of smaller and spherical
(fragmented) mitochondria seen in the control rats with heart
failure. Sustained SAMβA delivery had no impact on blood
pressure in rats with heart failure (Supplementary Table 3).

 failure that were treated with the SAMβA for 6 weeks presented
reduced cardiac mitochondrial H2O2 and H2O2:O2 release when
compared to control heart failure rats (Fig. 6h, i; Supplementary
Figure 3b). Of interest, sustained SAMβA treatment was sufficient
to reduce apoptotic cell death in failing hearts as compared to that
in hearts from vehicle-treated rats (Supplementary Figure 3c).
Therefore, sustained blockage of Mfn1-βIIPKC interaction was
critical to protect against accumulation of fragmented/dysfunc-
tional mitochondria with an impact on cell death in heart failure.
Next, we tested the effectiveness of SAMβA on reducing Mfn1-
βIIPKC interaction in failing hearts. Immunoblot analysis of anti-
βIIPKC immunoprecipitates with anti-Mfn1 and anti-serine/
threonine antibodies demonstrated increased Mfn1-βIIPKC asso-
ciation and phosphorylation at the molecular size of Mfn1 in heart
failure samples that were reduced by SAMβA (Fig. 6j, left panel).
The selectivity of SAMβA as a Mfn1-βIIPKC association and
phosphorylation inhibitor was also tested by determining its impact
on βIIPKC-troponin I association. Troponin I is a well-known
βIIPKC substrate in heart failure28. Immunoblot analysis of anti-
βIIPKC
immunoprecipitates
with
anti-troponin

and
anti-
phosphorylated troponin I antibodies demonstrated an elevated
βIIPKC-troponin
I
interaction
and
phosphorylation
at
the
molecular size of troponin I in heart failure samples that were
not affected by SAMβA (Fig. 6j, right panel). These findings provide
evidence that SAMβA selectively targets the elevated Mfn1-βIIPKC
interaction in heart failure and not another βIIPKC substrate.
Finally, we compared the benefit of treatments with βIIV5-3 (a
global βIIPKC inhibitor) relative to SAMβA (a selective Mfn1-
βIIPKC protein–protein interaction inhibitor) in improving
ventricular function and remodeling in heart failure. Both

 treatments prevented the progression of heart failure, measured
by the drop in left ventricular ejection fraction and increase in
cardiac dilation over time (before vs. after treatment, Fig. 7a, b).
However, only the treatment with SAMβA resulted in a
significant improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction when
compared to week 4 (before treatment, Fig. 7a, b).
Discussion
There is much interest in the role of mitochondrial dynamics in
cardiac physiology and pathology. However, the upstream
molecular mechanisms affecting mitochondrial morphology in
cardiac diseases are largely unknown. The preclinical studies
described here suggest that βIIPKC activation contributes to
heart failure by inhibiting Mfn1, therefore causing accumula-
tion of fragmented/dysfunctional mitochondria, most likely
resulting from impaired mitochondrial fusion.
Our previous studies demonstrated that βIIPKC, a serine-
threonine protein kinase C isozyme, is elevated in human failing
hearts11 and plays a critical role in the progression of heart failure in
rodents12. βIIPKC activation was also previously demonstrated to
be involved in changes in mitochondrial morphology in MEFs upon

 oxidative conditions29. Here we identified at least one downstream
βIIPKC substrate that mediates cardiac pathophysiology. We
demonstrated that during heart failure, βIIPKC translocated to the
mitochondrial outer membrane, where it is bound to and phos-
phorylated Mfn1. The phosphorylation of Mfn1 by βIIPKC at S86
located in the GTPase domain in Mfn1, correlated with a reduction
of Mfn1 GTPase activity, but also correlated with an increase in
Mfn1 levels at the mitochondria. This is in contrast to Mfn1
phosphorylation by ERK, which also induces mitochondrial frag-
mentation in MEFs30, but it drives Mfn1-increased clearance
thorough ubiquitin proteasome system31,32. The accumulation of
βIIPKC-phosphorylated Mfn1 could be due to the site of phos-
phorylation and or because failing hearts have impaired both pro-
teasomal proteolytic activity11 and autophagy33. Regardless of the
mechanism, βIΙPKC phosphorylation of Mfn1 impairs its GTPase
activity, which is critical for mitochondrial fusion activity34. Dis-
ruption of Mfn1 activity leads to metabolic dysfunction35.
Finally, we confirmed that Mfn1 phosphorylation and inhibi-
tion by βIIPKC alone is a major contributor to the pathophy-
siology associated with heart failure in this post-myocardial
infarction heart failure rat model, using SAMβA, a rationally
designed selective antagonist of Mfn1-βIIPKC association. This
inhibitory peptide is composed of a 9-amino-acid peptide
(RNAENFDRF; βIIPKC624-632) conjugated to the cell permeable
peptide TAT47-5736. A 6-week treatment of myocardial infarction-
induced heart failure rats with SAMβA, starting 4 weeks after
myocardial infarction at a time when ventricular remodeling and
cardiac dysfunction were present, re-established mitochondrial
morphology, bioenergetics, and redox balance. In addition,
SAMβA had a superior effect on cardiac function, left ventricular
compliance, and diastolic function compared to the global
βIIPKC inhibitor, βIIV5-3.
Our previous studies showed that preventing accumulation of
fragmented mitochondria using other pharmacological means is

 also beneficial. A peptide inhibitor of phosphorylation of Drp1 by
δPKC, δV1-1 or an inhibitor of Drp1 interaction with Fis1, P110,
protect
neurons
and
cardiomyocytes
from
acute
ischemic
stress37–39 and a rationally designed peptide activator of Mfn2
corrects mitochondrial fusion defects in a model of Charcot-
Marie-Tooth model in neurons40. Therefore, the molecular basis
of
increased
mitochondrial
fragmentation
can
be
diverse,
depending on the disease. However, in all these cases, correcting
the mitochondrial morphology improves outcome, by correcting
mitochondrial functions and ATP production. We suggest that
the improvement in mitochondrial functions is critical for cellular
health and that the benefit we saw with sustained treatment using
SAMβA on reversal of the cardiac pathological remodeling and
dysfunction induced by post-myocardial infarction is due to
increased repair ability of the cells. From a clinical standpoint,
future experiments checking the effectiveness of SAMβA in pre-
venting the development of heart failure by starting the treatment
immediately after myocardial infarction are needed. It is also
important to validate the cardiac benefits of SAMβA by looking at
different models of cardiomyopathy and heart failure.
In conclusion, our findings of increased mitochondrial frag-
mentation in failing hearts and its dependence on βIIPKC acti-
vation suggest that βIIPKC is a regulator of mitochondrial
dynamics through Mfn1 phosphorylation, at least under patho-
logical conditions. Our data also suggest that correcting impaired
mitochondrial dynamics, in general, and selectively inhibiting
Mfn1-βIIPKC interaction with drugs, such as SAMβA, may
provide useful treatments for patients with established heart
failure.

Animals. The animal protocols were approved by the Stanford University Insti-
tutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Protocol ID: 14746) and by the Ethical
Committee of Biomedical Sciences Institute of University of São Paulo (2013/134).
This study was conducted in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals published by the US-National Institutes of Health and with the
ethical principles in animal research adopted by the Brazilian Society of Laboratory
Animal (www.cobea.org.br). The study with βIIV5-3 treatment in male rats included
three groups: sham, n = 10; TAT-treated (control) heart failure, n = 10; βIIV5-3-
treated heart failure, n = 10. The study with SAMβA treatment included sham, n =
7; TAT-treated (control) heart failure, n = 8 and SAMβA-treated heart failure, n =
11. No animals were excluded from the study. Sham and myocardial infarction
surgery were done on the same day, usually 10 rats per day. Four weeks after
myocardial infarction, rats were randomized to drug treatments.
Myocardial infarction-induced heart failure. We have chosen this rat model
since myocardial infarction is the underlying etiology of heart failure in nearly 70%
of patients42. Myocardial infarction was induced by a permanent ligation of the left
anterior descending coronary artery in Wistar normotensive male rats at 12 weeks
of age43. Rats were anesthetized intraperitoneally with ketamine (50 mg Kg−1) and
xylazine (10 mg Kg−1), endotracheally intubated, and mechanically ventilated with
room air (respiratory rate of 60–70 breaths per minute and tidal volume of 2.5 mL).
Left thoracotomy between the fourth and fifth ribs was performed and the left
anterior descending coronary artery was permanently ligated44. Four weeks later,
echocardiography (Acuson Sequoia, 14 MHz) to evaluate fractional shortening was
performed and rats showing heart failure symptoms were included in the study.
Heart failure was defined when animal presented pathological cardiac remodeling
accompanied by left ventricle dysfunction and cardiac dilation, according to the
Guidelines of American Heart Association45. Left thoracotomy with equal proce-
dure duration, but without left anterior descending coronary artery ligation, was
undertaken in the sham group.
Study design. Heart failure animals were treated between the ages of 16 and
22 weeks. Rats were randomized to the treatment groups. Each group was treated
with TAT47–57-βIIV5-3 peptide (global βIIPKC inhibitor, 3 mg per Kg per day),
TAT47–57-SAMβA peptide Mfn1-βIIPKC inhibitor, 3 mg per Kg per day) or
equimolar concentration of TAT47–57-carrier peptide, using Alzet osmotic pumps
under the skin on the back of the animal, and were replaced every 2 weeks. The
sham group was subjected to TAT47–57-carrier peptide treatment, as a negative
control. At the end of the protocol, cardiac function was re-evaluated by observer
blinded to the treatment groups. Forty-eight hours later, all rats were euthanized by
decapitation for other analyses. Hearts were dissected into infarct and viable zones
using the following criteria. The infarct zone was the left ventricular wall that was
thinning and included visible infarct scar, and the viable (remote) zone was the part
of the left ventricular wall that was reddish-brown and with normal thickness. All
biochemical measurements were performed in the left ventricular viable (remote)
zone.
Cardiovascular measurements. Systolic blood pressure was determined non-
invasively, using a computerized tail-cuff system (BP-2000, Visitech System). Non-
invasive cardiac function evaluation was performed by M-mode echocardiography
in anesthetized (isoflurane 3%) rats. Briefly, rats were positioned in the supine
position with front paws wide open and ultrasound transmission gel was applied to
the precordium. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed using an Acuson
Sequoia model 512 echocardiographer (SIEMENS) equipped with a 14-MHz linear
transducer. Left ventricle systolic function was estimated by ejection fraction (EF)
and fractional shortening (FS) as follows: EF (%) = [(LVEDD3—LVESD3)
LVEDD3–1)]×100 and FS (%) = [(LVEDD—LVESD) LVEDD(−1)]×100, where
LVEDD is the left ventricular end-diastolic diameter, and LVESD is the left ven-
tricular end-systolic diameter. The observer was blinded to the treatment groups.
Isolation of adult rat cardiomyocytes. Ten weeks after MI surgery, control,
vehicle-treated HF and βIIV5-3-treated HF rats were injected with heparin (2000 U
kg−1 IP), anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (100 mg kg−1 IP) and euthanized
by decapitation. The hearts were rapidly excised and then perfused with low-Ca2+
solution 1 (100 mM NaCl, 10 mM KCl, 1.2 mM KH2PO4, 5 mM MgSO4, 20 mM
glucose, 50 mM taurine, 10 mM HEPES, and 100 μM CaCl2), then with digestion
solution containing low-Ca2+ solution 1, collagenase (0.5 mg mL−1, Worthington
Type 1 A), and protease type XIV (0.04 mg mL−1; Sigma). Following perfusion, the
ventricles were cut into fragments (2–5 mm3) in digestion solution. The cell sus-
pension was then filtered through a nylon sieve and centrifuged for 1 min (at
300–400 × g) at room temperature. Cell pellets were resuspended in solution 1
containing 125 mg BSA and 500 μM CaCl2.
Cardiomyocyte shortening and relengthening. Cell contraction properties of
adult cardiomyocytes were evaluated with a video-based sarcomere spacing
acquisition system (SarcLen, IonOptix)46. Changes in sarcomere length were
recorded and analyzed using IonWizard software (IonOptix). Sarcomeric short-
ening was determined under basal conditions.
Mitochondrial isolation. Cardiac samples from remote area were minced and
homogenized in isotonic mitochondrial buffer (300 mM sucrose, 10 mM Hepes, 2
mM EGTA, pH 7.2, 4 °C) containing 0.1 mg mL−1 of type I protease (bovine
pancreas, Sigma P4630) to release mitochondria from within muscle fibers and
later washed in the same buffer in the presence of 1 mg mL−1 bovine serum
albumin47. The suspension was homogenized in a 40 mL tissue grinder and cen-
trifuged at 950 × g for 5 min. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 9500 × g
for 10 min. The mitochondrial pellet was washed, resuspended in isolation buffer
and submitted to a new centrifugation (9500 × g for 10 min). The mitochondrial
pellet was washed and the final pellet was resuspended in a minimal volume of
isolation buffer.
Mitochondrial function. All experiments with isolated mitochondria (0.125 mg
mitochondrial protein mL−1) were monitored in experimental buffer containing
125 mM sucrose, 65 mM KCl, 10 mM Hepes, 2 mM inorganic phosphate, 2 mM
MgCl2, 100 µM EGTA, and 0.01% BSA, pH 7.2 and were performed in the presence
of succinate, malate, and glutamate substrates (2 mM of each) with continuous
stirring at 37 °C48. Mitochondrial O2 consumption was monitored using a
computer-interfaced Clark-type electrode (OROBOROS Oxygraph−2k). ADP (1
mM—Amresco 0160) was added to induce State 3 respiratory rates. A subsequent
addition of oligomycin (1 µg mL−1—Sigma 4876) was used to determine State 4
rates. Respiratory control ratios were calculated by the State 3:State 4 ratio.
Additionally, 0.1 mM FCCP [Carbonyl cyanide 4-(trifluoromethoxy) phenylhy-
drazone—Enzo BML-CM120] was added in order to evaluate O2 consumption
in uncoupled mitochondria48. Mitochondrial H2O2 release was measured
using Amplex Red (25 μM—Molecular Probes A12222)-horseradish peroxidase
(0.5 U mL−1– Sigma P8125) system48. Amplex Red is oxidized in the presence of
extramitochondrial horseradish peroxidase bound to H2O2, generating resorufin,
which can be detected using a fluorescence spectrophotometer (ʎex = 563/ʎem =
587 nm) (F-2500 Hitachi—Hitachi). To estimate H2O2 release during State 3 and
State 4 respiratory rates, and in uncoupled mitochondria, we added ADP (1 mM),

 oligomycin (1 µg mL−1), and FCCP (0.1 mM), respectively. Calibration was con-
ducted by adding H2O2 at known concentrations (A240 = 43.6 M–1.cm–1) to the
experimental buffer.
Immunoblotting. Cardiac samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE in polyacrylamide
gels (6–15%) depending upon protein molecular weight. After electrophoresis,
proteins were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Equal gel loading
and transfer efficiency were monitored using 0.5% Ponceau S staining of blot
membrane. Blotted membrane was then blocked (5% BSA, 10 mM Tris-HCl; pH
7.6), 150 mM NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) for 2 h at room temperature and then
incubated overnight at 4 °C with specific antibodies against Drp1 (611113, dilution
1:1000) from BD Biosciences; GAPDH (RGM2, dilution 1:10000) from Advanced
Immunochemical; Mfn1 (H00055669-M04, dilution 1:1000), Mfn2 (H00009927-
M01, dilution 1:1000), Opa1 (H00004976-M01, dilution 1:1000), and IDH2

and NDP52-CALCOCO2 (12229-1-AP, dilution 1:1000) from Proteintech; Fis1
(210-907-R100, dilution 1:1000) from Enzo Life Sciences and αPKC (sc-208,
dilution 1:1000), βIPKC (sc-209, dilution 1:1000), βIIPKC (sc-210, dilution 1:500),
δPKC (sc-213, dilution 1:500), εPKC (sc-214, dilution 1:500), RACK1 (sc-10775,
dilution 1:500), Tom20 (sc-11021, dilution 1:500), VDAC (sc-32063, dilution

Mfn1 (sc-50330, dilution 1:500) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Positive and
negative controls for the detection of Mfn1 are shown in Supplementary Figure 4b.
Binding of the primary antibody was detected with the use of peroxidase-
conjugated secondary antibodies (rabbit, mouse or goat for 2 h at room tempera-
ture, dilution 1:10,000) and developed using enhanced chemiluminescence detected
by autoradiography. Quantification analysis of blots was performed with the use of
Image J software (Image J Corporation based on NIH image). The protein contents
were quantified by the Bradford method49. Samples were normalized to relative
changes in housekeeping proteins [GAPDH (heart lysate), VDAC (mitochondrial
fraction) or IDH2 (mitochondrial fraction)] and expressed as the percent of con-
trol. Original blot data are available in the Supplementary information (Supple-
mentary Figures 5–8).
Immunoprecipitation. Cardiac mitochondrial fraction (0.25 mg protein) and lysate
(0.5 mg protein) were incubated with 2 μg of the indicated antibodies in 1 mL
immunoprecipitation lysis buffer (NaCl 150 mM, EDTA 5 mM, Tris-HCl 10 mM,
Triton X100 0.1%, pH 7.4) for 3 h at 4 °C, followed by incubation with 50 μL of
protein A/G agarose beads (sc-2003 Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at 4 °C.
After low speed centrifugation, 1000 × g for 5 min at room temperature, pellet was
washed 3 times in 1 mL immunoprecipitation lysis buffer with low speed cen-
trifugation after each washed. The immunoprecipitates were either assayed for
GTPase activity or separated on SDS–PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose
membranes. The membranes were then probed with the indicated antibodies.
GTPase activity assay. Recombinant Drp1 (H00010059-P01), Mfn1 (H00055669-
P01), or Mfn2 (H00009927-Q01) from Abnova were incubated with 50 ng of
recombinant βIIPKC (ab60841) from Abcam in assay buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH
7.5, 1 mM CaCl2, 20 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 25 nM ATP) in the presence and
absence of phosphatidylserine and diacylglycerol PS/DAG for 30 min at 37 °C.
GTPase activity of the proteins was determined using a GTPase assay kit
(602–0120, Novus Biologicals) according to manufacturer’s instructions. To
determine GTPase activity of Mfn1 and Mfn2 in the tissue lysate, a total of 0.25 mg
cardiac mitochondria were immunoprecipitated overnight with 2 μg of antibodies
against Mfn1 or Mfn2 and 50 μL of Protein A/G–agarose33. After three washes with
lysis buffer and three washes with GTPase buffer (50 mM Tris [pH 7.5], 2.5 mM
MgCl2, and 0.02% 2- mercaptoethanol), the beads were incubated with 0.5 mM
GTP at 30 °C for 1 h. The released free phosphate was quantified using the GTPase
assay kit, as above.
Phosphorylation assay. Twenty-five nanogram of recombinant Mfn1
(H00055669-P01, Abnova) was incubated with 50 ng of recombinant βIPKC
(ab60840, Abcam) or βIIPKC (ab60841, Abcam) in assay buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl,
pH 7.5, 1 mM CaCl2, 20 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, and 25 nM ATP) in the presence
and absence of phosphatidylserine and diacylglycerol PS/DAG for 30 min at 37 °C.
Mfn1 phosphorylation was evaluated using radioactive [P32] P32-ATP
incorporation11.
Mass spectrometry analysis. The identification of Mfn1 phosphorylation at
βIIPKC site was performed by incubating recombinant Mfn1 with recombinant
βIIPKC plus PS/DG/Ca (PKC activators). Phosphopeptide spectra of Mfn1 was
examined using LC/MS/MS. LTQ Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer was used, the
nano HPLC was an Eksigent nano 2D with a flow rate of 0.6 μL min−1. In solution
digestion was done with trypsin overnight. Peptides were further purified on a
stagetip using C18 matrix. Data-dependent acquisition was used and the top 10
most intense peptides identified in the survey scan were selected for fragmentation
using higher energy collisional-induced dissociation (HCD).
Proteinase K digestion. For proteinase K digestion, isolated mitochondria
were suspended in isotonic mitochondrial buffer and incubated for 15 min with
5 μg mL−1 proteinase K at 37 °C. Digestion was terminated by adding 2 mM
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Mitochondrial proteins were separated on
SDS–PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were
then probed with the indicated antibodies.
Transmission electron microscopy. Cardiac samples and culture neonatal rat
cardiomyocytes were fixed, embedded, and stained50. Small blocks (5 blocks per
animal) from a cardiac remote area and from neonatal cardiomyocyte pellets were
fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde and 4% paraformaldehyde in sodium cacodylate
buffer, pH 7.3 for 1 h at room temperature and cut into ~1 mm3 blocks. After
several buffer washes, samples were post-fixed in 2% osmium tetroxide and 1%
uranyl acetate for 2 h, rinsed in water, dehydrated through ascending concentra-
tions of ethanol followed by 100% acetone, and then infiltrated and embedded in
Eponate 12. Final blocks were used to evaluate intermyofibrillar mitochondrial
number and size. Images were acquired using a JEOL1230 Gatan 967 CCD
transmission electron microscope at 80 kV and a Gatan Orius 4k×4k digital camera
(Gatan). We performed quantitative analysis in at least 10 fields per rat (3 rats per
group) and at least 15 cardiomyocytes per group (3 independent experiments)
using Image J software. The analysis was done in a blinded fashion.
Cell culture. WT (ATCC CRL-2991) and Mfn1 knockout (ATCC CRL-2992)
MEFs were acquired from ATCC and cultured in Dulbecco’s Modification of
Eagle’s Medium/Ham’s F-12 50/50 Mix supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U mL−1
penicillin, and 100 μg mL−1 streptomycin. Site-directed mutagenesis was per-
formed to generate Mfn1 S86A, S284A and S290A variants using a QuickChange
site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Mutants were sequenced to ensure that
no additional mutations were introduced and then transfected into Mfn1 knockout
MEFs using Lipofectamine transfection reagent (Thermo). Primary cultures of
neonatal cardiac myocytes were prepared from the heart of 1-day-old rats by gentle
digestion at 37 °C using a cell isolation kit protocol (ac-7018, Cellutron)39. Cells
were cultured in the presence of 0.1 mmol L−1 bromodeoxyuridine on primary
tissue culture dishes (BD Falcon) or on laminin-coated slides in Dulbeco’s modified
Eagle’s medium with 10% fetal bovine serum for 4 days. Primary cultures of adult
cardiac myocytes were prepared from the heart of 2-month-old rats by enzymatic
digestion with collagenase Type II (Worthington) using a Langendorff system51.
Cells were cultured in M199 medium supplemented with 2 mg ml−1 BSA, 1 μM
insulin, 2 mM carnitine hydrochloride, 5 mM creatine, and 5 mM taurine for 2 h.
Small interfering siRNA duplexes for βIIPKC or negative control were obtained
from Amcon Biotechnology. Cardiac myocytes at 50% confluency were transfected
for 48 h with siRNA of βIIPKC or negative control siRNA using Lipofectamine
2000 (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Immunocytochemistry. Cells cultured on coverslips were washed with cold PBS,
fixed in 4% formaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. After
incubation with 2% normal goat serum (to block non-specific staining), fixed cells
were incubated overnight at 4 °C with antibodies against Tom20 (sc-11021, Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, dilution 1:500). Cells were washed with PBS and incubated for
60 min with FITC-labeled goat anti-rabbit antibody (65–6111, Invitrogen, dilution
1:500) followed by incubation with Hoechst dye (1:10000) for 10 min. Coverslips
were mounted and slides were imaged using a DeltaVision OMX SR wide field
deconvolution fluorescence microscope (Applied Precision Inc). Quantification
was carried out using Image J software.
Measurement of cell viability. Cell viability was measured using an in vitro
toxicology assay, MTT-based kit (Sigma), according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Cell death was detected by measuring lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)
activity in the cell culture media. For each assay, the media was combined with
Sodium pyruvate (30 mM), NADH (6.6 mM), and Tris-HCL (0.2 M, pH 7.3), in a
final volume to 200 µl. LDH activity was determined by a decrease in absorbance at
340 nm for 10 min at 25 °C, resulting from the oxidation of NADH.
Peptide synthesis. Peptides were synthesized using solid-phase chemistry on a
Liberty Microwave Peptide Synthesizer (CEM Corporation, Matthews)7. Peptides
were synthesized as one polypeptide with TAT47–57 carrier in the following order:
N-terminus–TAT–spacer (Gly-Gly)–cargo–C-terminus.
Statistical analysis. Data are presented as means ± standard error of the mean
(SEM). Data normality was assessed through Shapiro-Wilk test. One-way analysis
of variance (ANOVA) was used to analyze data presented in Figs. 1–6. Two-way
ANOVA for repeated measures was used to analyze data depicted in Fig. 7.
Whenever significant F-values were obtained, Duncan adjustment was used for
multiple comparison purposes. GraphPad Prism Statistics was used for the analysis
and statistical significance was considered achieved when the value of P was <0.05.
