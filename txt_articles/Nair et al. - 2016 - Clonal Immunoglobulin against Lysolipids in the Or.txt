Summary
Antigen-driven selection has been implicated in the pathogenesis of monoclonal gammopathies. 
Patients with Gaucher’s disease have an increased risk of monoclonal gammopathies. Here we 
show that the clonal immunoglobulin in patients with Gaucher’s disease and in mouse models of 
Gaucher’s disease–associated gammopathy is reactive against lyso-glucosylceramide (LGL1), 
which is markedly elevated in these patients and mice. Clonal immunoglobulin in 33% of sporadic 
human monoclonal gammopathies is also specific for the lysolipids LGL1 and 
lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC). Substrate reduction ameliorates Gaucher’s disease–associated 
gammopathy in mice. Thus, longterm immune activation by lysolipids may underlie both 
Gaucher’s disease–associated gammopathies and some sporadic monoclonal gammopathies.
Multiple myeloma and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) are 
characterized by clonal expansion of transformed plasma cells.1 Analyses of 
immunoglobulin genes in tumor cells have provided evidence of antigen-driven selection, 
with restricted heavy-chain variableregion use and highly hypermutated immunoglobulin 
heavy- and light-chain genes.2–6 However, the antigens underlying the origins of most 
MGUS and myeloma clones remain unknown. Hyperphosphorylated modification of 
stomatin (EPB72)-like 2 protein (STOML2, which is identical to paratarg-7) due to the 
inactivation of protein phosphatase 2A was identified as a target of certain paraproteins and 
an inherited risk factor for the development of gammopathies.7–9 A recent study identified 
sumoylated heat-shock protein 90 as another inherited risk factor for plasma-cell 
dyscrasia.10 However, there remains a need to identify the antigenic origins of MGUS and 
myeloma that may be amenable to targeted prevention.
Lipids (such as pristane) were implicated in the earliest models of murine plasmacytoma,11 
and lipid disorders such as Gaucher’s disease and obesity are associated with an increased 
risk of myeloma.12,13 The risk of myeloma is markedly higher among patients with 
Gaucher’s disease, in whom myeloma is now emerging as a leading cause of cancer-related

 death, than in the general population.13 Glucocerebrosidase deficiency in Gaucher’s disease 
leads to increases in the level of LGL1.14 Recently, we identified a subset of human and 
murine LGL1-specific CD1d-restricted type 2 natural killer T cells that constitutively 
expressed markers of follicular helper T cells and helped in the differentiation of lipid-
reactive plasma cells.15 In an earlier study, we found an elevation of type 2 natural killer T 
cells against another bioactive lysolipid, LPC, in myeloma.16 These studies led us to test 
whether the clonal immunoglobulin in Gaucher’s disease–associated myeloma and sporadic 
myeloma was reactive against LGL1 and LPC.
Methods
Patients and Mice
Peripheral-blood or bone marrow samples were obtained from patients with MGUS or 
myeloma and Gaucher’s disease and from healthy blood donors. Written informed consent 
was obtained from all the participants. The study was approved by the institutional review 
board at Yale University.
The generation of glucocerebrosidase-deficient (GBA1−/−) mice has been described 
previously.17 All the mice were bred and maintained in compliance with the guidelines of 
the institutional animal care committee at Yale University.
Lipids
LGL1 (with purity assessed at >98% by thin-layer chromatography) was purchased from 
Matreya and was stored frozen (at −20°C) at a concentration of 500 µg per milliliter of 50% 
dimethyl sulfoxide in distilled water as storage stock.15 LPC was purchased from Avanti 
Polar Lipids, dissolved in chloroform at a concentration of 10 mg per milliliter, and stored at 
−20°C as storage stock.16 Diacylglycerol (DAG; at a concentration of 1 mg per milliliter of 
chloroform), cardiolipin (at a concentration of 25 mg per milliliter of chloroform), and lipid 
A (at a concentration of 1 mg per milliliter of dimethyl sulfoxide) were all purchased from 
Avanti Polar Lipids and were stored at −20°C as storage stock.
Antigen-Specific Immunoblotting
Polyvinylidene fluoride membranes that were saturated with LGL1 and LPC (BioRad) were 
prepared as described previously.18 Briefly, filters were incubated in 100 µg per milliliter of 
LGL1 and LPC in 0.5 M sodium bicarbonate, rinsed in phosphatebuffered saline (PBS) and 
0.05% Tween 20 detergent, and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA). Gels for 
serum protein electrophoresis were blotted onto lipid membranes with the use of modified 
diffusion blotting.19 After blocking with 1% BSA in PBS and Tween 20 detergent, the 
membrane was incubated with appropriate horseradish peroxidase (HRP)–conjugated 
secondary antibody and was washed and developed with the use of SuperSignal West Pico 
chemiluminescent substrate (Thermo Scientific).
Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay
Diluted human plasma (1:250 dilution) was added to plates coated with LGL1 (500 ng per 
well), and the levels of kappa and lambda immunoglobulin light chains were determined

 with the use of human kappa- and lambda-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 
(ELISA) quantification kits (Bethyl Laboratories).15 To measure hen-egg lysozyme (HEL)–
specific and lipid (LGL1, DAG, cardiolipin, and lipid A)–specific antibodies, plates (Nunc- 
Immuno plate, Thermo Scientific) were coated with an equimolar concentration of antigens 
overnight at room temperature and then blocked with 1% BSA in PBS and Tween 20 
detergent for 2 hours at room temperature. The test serum and purified immunoglobulin 
sample were diluted in 1% BSA in PBS and Tween 20 detergent and incubated overnight at 
4°C. The antigen-specific antibody was detected by HRP-conjugated mouse and human 
immunoglobulins that had been developed with TMB chromogen (3,3′,5,5′-
tetramethylbenzidine; Invitrogen).
Ligand-Mediated Enrichment and Depletion of Clonal Immunoglobulin
Diluted human plasma (1:250 dilution) was incubated with 50 mm3 of either control or 
sphingosinecoated beads (Echelon Biosciences). Plasma and beads were mixed together by 
incubating the suspension under rotary agitation (on an orbital shaker) at 4°C. After 
incubation, the tubes were centrifuged, and the supernatant (flow-through) was analyzed by 
means of serum protein electrophoresis. The bead pellet was washed four times with the 
coimmunoprecipitation buffer. The antibody bound to the beads was eluted by boiling the 
sample in sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer for 5 
minutes. Samples were analyzed by means of Western blotting with antihuman IgG, IgA, 
and IgM heavy chains and kappa and lambda light chains HRP antibodies. Signal intensities 
were densitometrically quantitated with the use of ImageJ software, version 1.41 (National 
Institutes of Health).
Injection of GBA1−/− Mice
GBA1−/− mice were injected intraperitoneally with either PBS or LGL1 (at a dose of 200 µg 
per mouse each week for 3 weeks) in a volume of 100 mm3. The mice were euthanized 7 
days after the last injection. The diluted serum specimen (1:250 dilution) was used for the 
quantification of lipid-specific antibodies with the use of ELISA, as described previously.15 
HEL, which was purchased from Sigma, was mixed with an adjuvant to yield an emulsion of 
2 mg per milliliter, of which 50 mm3 (100 µg per mouse) was injected intraperitoneally in 
three GBA1−/− mice (8 to 12 weeks old); three GBA1−/− mice received alum (Imject Alum 
Adjuvant, Thermo Fisher Scientific) in PBS as a control.
Substrate-Reduction Therapy
The drug eliglustat (Genz-112638, Genzyme), a glucocerebroside synthase inhibitor that 
prevents the overproduction of LGL1, was formulated in a standard rodent food (test diet) in 
a weight-to-weight ratio of 0.075. Seven mice with Gaucher’s disease received the test diet 
daily at a dose of 150 mg per kilogram of body weight, and seven mice with Gaucher’s 
disease that were matched for age and sex were given a base diet (control diet). The animals 
received the assigned diets for 2 months and were then euthanized for tissue and blood 
collection.

 Statistical Analysis
The cohorts of patients with Gaucher’s disease and sporadic monoclonal gammopathy 
(MGUS or myeloma) and of healthy donors were compared with the use of nonparametric 
statistics, and P values were calculated. Two-tailed P values at an alpha level of 0.05 were 
considered to indicate statistical significance. Fisher’s exact tests and Mann–Whitney U 
tests were performed with the use of Stata software (StataCorp).
Results
Clonal Immunoglobulin in Gaucher’s Disease
To evaluate whether the monoclonal immunoglobulin in the context of Gaucher’s disease 
reacts with LGL1, we analyzed the reactivity of clonal immunoglobulin against LGL1 with 
an antigen-specific immunoblot (Fig. 1A and 1B). Clonal immunoglobulin in 17 of 20 
patients with Gaucher’s disease and in 6 of 6 GBA1−/− mice (which faithfully recapitulate 
type 1 Gaucher’s disease in humans)17 with monoclonal gammopathy was specific for 
LGL1. LGL1 reactivity was also observed for Gaucher’s disease–associated polyclonal 
gammopathy (Fig. 1A). In contrast, only low-level or background reactivity was detected in 
samples obtained from healthy donors or control mice.
To show the capacity of LGL1 to mediate B-cell and plasma-cell activation in Gaucher’s 
disease in vivo, we hyperimmunized young GBA1−/− mice with LGL1. These mice already 
have a mildly higher level of Fas+GL7+ germinal-center B cells at baseline than the level in 
control mice (Fig. 1C). However, the injection of LGL1 led to a further increase in Fas
+GL7+ splenic germinal-center B cells (Fig. 1C) as well as an increase in bone marrow 
CD38+CD138+ plasma cells (Fig. 1D, and Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, 
available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). Injection of these mice with LGL1 
— but not injection with an unrelated antigen (HEL) — led to the induction of anti-LGL1 
antibodies in vivo (Fig. 1E, and Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). These data show 
the capacity of LGL1 to mediate B-cell activation in Gaucher’s disease and serve as an 
antigenic target in Gaucher’s disease–associated monoclonal gammopathy.
Clonal Immunoglobulin in Sporadic Gammopathies
The dysregulation of bioactive lipids and lipid-reactive T cells has also been observed in 
patients with sporadic myeloma.16,20 Therefore, we analyzed whether clonal 
immunoglobulin in sporadic MGUS and myeloma is also lipid-reactive. M spikes in 33% of 
the patients tested (22 of 66 patients) were LGL1-reactive (Table 1 and Fig. 2A). LGL1-
reactive clonal immunoglobulins were cross-reactive against LPC (Fig. 2B). In contrast, no 
reactivity was observed in patients with polyclonal gammopathy that was not associated 
with Gaucher’s disease (Table 1, and Fig. S3 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Purified LGL1- and LPC-reactive clonal immunoglobulins did not react against cardiolipin, 
lipid A, or DAG in an antigen-specific immunoblot (Fig. 2C) or an ELISA with similar 
levels of purified immunoglobulin (Fig. S4 in the Supplementary Appendix). The lipid 
reactivity of clonal immunoglobulins was verified by means of several approaches. Analysis 
of kappa and lambda lightchain isotypes of anti-LGL1 antibodies revealed a strong light-

 chain skew toward the involved clonal light chain only in patients with lipid-reactive M 
spikes (Fig. S5 in the Supplementary Appendix).
LGL1-reactive immunoglobulins showed the same heavy- and light-chain specificity as the 
clonal immunoglobulin in immunoblotting (Fig. S6 in the Supplementary Appendix). The 
incubation of serum specimens with sphingosine-coated beads led to the specific enrichment 
of clonal immunoglobulin in the bead-binding fraction in patients with lipid-reactive M 
spikes, but not when the clonal immunoglobulin was not lipid-reactive (Fig. 2D). Similarly, 
the analysis of the bead flow-through fraction showed a specific depletion of M spikes only 
in patients with lipid-reactive M spikes (Fig. 2E).
F(ab′)2 fragments that were isolated from clonal immunoglobulins retained a capacity for 
antigen recognition that was similar to that for intact immunoglobulin in an ELISA and 
could be enriched by ligand-conjugated beads (Fig. S7 in the Supplementary Appendix), 
which indicated that the binding of these clonal immunoglobulins to ligands is F(ab′)2-
mediated. The binding affinity of LGL1-reactive clonal immunoglobulins to antigen was 
estimated to be approximately 57×10−9 M, which is comparable to that reported for other 
antibodies (Fig. S8 in the Supplementary Appendix).
The cohort of patients with lipid-reactive gammopathies had a higher proportion of kappa 
light-chain, stage I myeloma and a lower proportion of intermediate- or high-risk 
cytogenetic factors than did patients who did not have lipid-reactive clonal immunoglobulins 
(Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). These data show that the clonal 
immunoglobulin reacts with a bioactive lysolipid in nearly one third of patients with 
sporadic MGUS or myeloma, and the cohort of patients with lipid-reactive gammopathies 
may have a distinct clinical profile.
Discussion
Understanding the antigenic reactivity of clonal immunoglobulin not only has direct 
implications for antigenic origins of myeloma but also may lead to new strategies to prevent 
or treat clinical cancer by targeting the underlying antigen. Long-term antigenic stimulation 
may, in principle, also promote genomic instability in myeloma by engaging cytidine 
deaminases.21 In Gaucher’s disease– associated gammopathy, the reduction of LGL1 may 
be achieved by substrate-reduction therapies.22 Feeding eliglustat to GBA1−/− mice with 
clonal immunoglobulins led to a reduction in anti-LGL1 antibodies (Fig. 2F) as well as to a 
reduction of clonal immunoglobulin in vivo (Fig. 2G), which indicates that Gaucher’s 
disease–associated gammopathy can be targeted by the reduction of the underlying antigen. 
These data are also consistent with recent findings regarding a reduced risk of B-cell cancers 
with substrate reduction in another model of Gaucher’s disease.23
The dysregulation of lysolipids has also been described in the context of obesity.24 The risk 
of myeloma has been shown to be higher among obese persons than among persons of 
normal weight,1 and diet-induced obesity was recently shown to promote a myeloma-like 
condition in mice.25 Further studies in larger cohorts are needed to confirm clinical 
correlations and better define the genetics of lipid-reactive myeloma. Clinical studies are

 needed to assess whether altering the levels of bioactive lipids can influence the natural 
history of gammopathies with specificity for such lipids.
