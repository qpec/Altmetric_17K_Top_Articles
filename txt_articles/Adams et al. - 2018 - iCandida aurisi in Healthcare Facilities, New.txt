 Candida auris is an emerging yeast that causes healthcare-
associated infections. It can be misidentified by laborato-
ries and often is resistant to antifungal medications. We 
describe an outbreak of C. auris infections in healthcare fa-
cilities in New York City, New York, USA. The investigation 
included laboratory surveillance, record reviews, site visits, 
contact tracing with cultures, and environmental sampling. 
We identified 51 clinical case-patients and 61 screening 
case-patients. Epidemiologic links indicated a large, inter-
connected web of affected healthcare facilities throughout 
New York City. Of the 51 clinical case-patients, 23 (45%) 
died within 90 days and isolates were resistant to flucon-
azole for 50 (98%). Of screening cultures performed for 572 
persons (1,136 total cultures), results were C. auris positive 
for 61 (11%) persons. Environmental cultures were posi-
tive for samples from 15 of 20 facilities. Colonization was 
frequently identified during contact investigations; environ-
mental contamination was also common.
C
andida auris is an emerging yeast that has caused 
healthcare-associated infections on multiple conti-
nents (1–13). The organism was first described in 2009 
by Satoh et al. for a patient in Japan (14). In November 
2016, Vallabhaneni et al. (11) reported cases in the United 
States. Identification of C. auris requires specialized labo-
ratory techniques (15–17). It is often resistant to antifungal 
medications (18), causes invasive infections (1,4,5) and 
outbreaks (8,10), and has become endemic to hospitals in 
some parts of the world (2,5,6). Therefore, its detection in 
New York, USA, healthcare facilities is concerning. We 
describe an ongoing outbreak of healthcare-associated C. 
auris cases involving multiple healthcare facilities in New 
York City (NYC), New York, USA, during 2013–2017.
Methods
Definitions and Data Analysis
We defined a case-patient as a person for whom a culture 
was positive for C. auris. Clinical cases are those for which 
the culture was obtained to diagnose or treat disease; screen-
ing cases are those for which the culture was obtained for 
surveillance purposes. We defined contacts as persons who 
had an epidemiologic link to a case-patient in place or time. 
We included clinical cases reported by April 30, 2017. Be-
cause surveillance cultures of contacts are performed after 
an associated clinical case is reported, we included surveil-
lance cultures that were collected by June 26, 2017, and 
had final results available by July 19, 2017, which enabled 
us to better approximate the number of screening cases as-
sociated with clinical cases described herein. Data were 
analyzed by using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) 
and Excel 2016 (Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA).
Case Finding and Investigation
In June 2016, the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention (CDC) issued an alert about C. auris (19), after 
which the New York State Department of Health (NYS-
DOH) issued an advisory (20) to inform healthcare fa-
cilities about the emerging pathogen and request that they 
notify NYSDOH of potential cases and forward suspected 
isolates to the New York state public health laboratory 
(Mycology Laboratory at Wadsworth Center, Albany, 
NY, USA). In November 2016, NYSDOH issued a

follow-up advisory (21) requesting that laboratories query 
their records for isolates of C. auris or species that could 
be confused with C. auris, such as C. haemulonii. Cases 
were also identified through active surveillance meth-
ods, including direct outreach to healthcare facilities and 
laboratories. Each clinical case was investigated through 
medical record reviews, contact tracing, and screening of 
contacts for colonization. 
Contact Tracing
We obtained the names of persons who had resided in the 
same room as a case-patient in the 90 days before diagnosis 
for the case-patient. When close contacts could be located, 
we attempted to obtain samples for culture. 
Surveillance and Infection Control Assessments
To emphasize the importance of detection, assist with infec-
tion control efforts, and conduct point prevalence surveys 
of facility contacts, we conducted site visits to facilities 
where transmission was suspected; our analysis included 
visits made through June 26, 2017. Initial point prevalence 
surveys included only a composite swab sample from the 
axilla and groin; subsequent surveys added a swab sample 
from the nares. For some persons, swab samples for sur-
veillance cultures to identify persistent colonization were 
obtained and included samples from the axilla, groin, nares, 
rectum, wounds, and sites of noninvasive clinical infection. 
We also assessed key areas of healthcare infection control, 
including administrative support, hand hygiene, standard 
and transmission-based precautions, and environmental 
cleaning; we followed up with detailed assessments in spe-
cific areas as needed.
Environmental Investigation
Whenever possible, we obtained samples from the environ-
ments of facilities where case-patients were admitted or 
resided. We concentrated on surfaces that were frequently 
touched and on objects in case-patients’ rooms.
Laboratory Techniques
To isolate C. auris from patient screening swab and en-
vironmental specimens, we used the method described by 
Welsh et al., with slight modification (15). In brief, we used 
the ESwab Culture and Transport system (Becton Dickin-
son, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and placed the samples in 
1 mL liquid Amies transport medium. Samples were vor-
texed for 30 s, after which 50 µL was plated on nonselec-
tive Sabouraud dextrose agar containing antibacterials 
(SDA-A), 50 µL was plated on selective media including 
SDA-A enriched with 10% salt (SDA-AS), and 200 µL was 
transferred to 5 mL of Sabouraud dextrose broth contain-
ing antibacterials and 10% salt (SDB-AS). Later, for more 
selective recovery of C. auris from surveillance samples, 
we placed dulcitol, instead of dextrose, in the selective en-
richment media.
We collected environmental samples by using sponge 
sticks (3M Health Care, St. Paul, MN, USA) and placed 
them in a zip-top bag containing 45 mL of phosphate- 
buffered saline (PBS) with 0.02% Tween 80. The bags 
were gently shaken for 1 min at 260 rpm in a Stomacher 
400 Circulator (Laboratory Supply Network, Inc., Atkin-
son, NH, USA). The suspension without the sponge was 
poured in a 50-mL conical tube and centrifuged at 4,000 
rpm for 5 min; supernatant was then decanted, leaving ≈3 
mL of liquid in the bottom of the tube. We placed 50 µL of 
sponge suspension on different agar media and placed 1 mL 
of sponge suspension in 5 mL of SDB-AS broth, as we had 
done for patient swab samples.
Agar plates and broth tubes were incubated at 40°C 
for at least 2 weeks. To check for purity, we first streaked 
recovered yeast isolates on CHROMagar Candida medium 
(Difco; Becton Dickinson, Baltimore, MD, USA) and then 
subcultured them on SDA overnight and processed them 
for identification by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ion-
ization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry 
by using the standard ethanol–formic acid extraction proce-
dure (22). Spectra were analyzed by using Flex Control 3.1 
software (Bruker Daltonics, Inc., Billerica, MA, USA) and 
MALDI Biotyper OC version 3.1 (Bruker Daltonics, Bre-
men, Germany); per manufacturer’s instructions, a score 
of >2.0 was used to identify Candida to the species level. 
The in-house MALDI-TOF database was enriched by add-
ing spectra from several C. auris isolates from the current 
outbreak and by adding reference isolates from the CDC 
AR bank (https://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/resistance-
bank/index.html); their identity was confirmed by DNA 
sequencing. To check for purity, we streaked the clinical 
isolates of yeasts received from healthcare facilities onto 
CHROMagar Candida medium and used MALDI-TOF 
mass spectrometry for identification as described.
The MICs of azoles and echinocandins were deter-
mined by using broth microdilution with custom TREK 
frozen broth microdilution panels (catalog no. CML2F-
CAN; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Marietta, OH, USA) (23). 
In brief, we prepared a suspension of C. auris at a concen-
tration of 0.5 × 103 to 2.5 × 103 in RPMI–1640 medium 
(with glutamic acid and phenol red, and without bicarbon-
ate; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and 0.2% glucose 
buffered to pH 7 with 0.165 mol/L 3-N morpholinepro-
panesulfonic acid (Sigma-Aldrich). We dispensed 100 µL 
C. auris inoculum into each well of the TREK plate. MICs 
of amphotericin B and 5-flucytosine were determined by 
Etest as recommended by the manufacturer (AB Biodisk; 
bioMérieux, Solna, Sweden) except that MICs were read 
at 24 h after incubation or until a confluent lawn of growth 
was seen. For Etests, the yeast inoculum was streaked on

 RESEARCH
RPMI medium containing 2% glucose and 1.5% agar, and 
then E-test strips were applied. C. krusei (ATCC 6258) and 
C. parapsilosis (ATCC 22019) were used as quality control 
strains. The TREK broth and Etest plates were incubated at 
35°C and read visually after 24 hours. Because there are no 
established C. auris–specific susceptibility breakpoints, we 
used tentative breakpoints published by CDC (16).
Environmental surveillance samples (sponges) were 
also processed by real-time PCR (24). In brief, 1 mL of 
sponge liquid was washed twice with PBS containing 
0.1% bovine serum albumin; as an inhibition control, 
pellet was resuspended in 50 µL PBS with 0.1% bovine 
serum albumin containing bicoid plasmid. Each sample 
went through freezing, heating, bead-beating, and cen-
trifugation, and 5 µL of extracted DNA was tested in 
duplicate by real-time PCR. According to receiver opera-
tor characteristic curve analysis, a cycle threshold value 
of <38 was reported as positive and >38 was reported as 
negative. If PCR inhibition was observed, specimens were 
reported as inconclusive. 
Results
Epidemiologic Investigation
We detected 51 clinical and 61 screening cases (Figure 1). 
All but 1 of the clinical cases from New York were diag-
nosed in NYC: 21 from 7 hospitals in Brooklyn, 16 from 3 
hospitals and 1 private medical office in Queens, 12 from 5 
hospitals and 1 long-term acute care hospital in Manhattan, 
and 1 from a hospital in the Bronx. One clinical case was 
identified in a western New York hospital in a patient who 
had recently been admitted to an involved Brooklyn hospi-
tal. Of the 51 clinical case-patients, 31 (61%) had resided 
in long-term care facilities (LTCFs) immediately before 
being admitted to the hospital in which their infection was 
diagnosed, and 19 of these 31 resided in skilled nursing 
facilities with ventilator beds (VSNFs); 1 (2%) resided in a 
long-term acute care hospital; 5 (10%) had been transferred 
from another hospital; and 4 (8%) had traveled internation-
ally within 5 years before diagnosis.
Exploration of epidemiologic links revealed a large, in-
terconnected web of affected healthcare facilities through-
out NYC (Figure 2). Determining the facility of acquisition 
of C. auris infection or colonization was difficult or impos-
sible because of multiple healthcare exposures and because 
the incubation period is unknown.
Clinical Characteristics
The median age of clinical case-patients was 72 years 
(range 21–96 years); 26 (51%) were male. All patients 
had serious concurrent medical conditions; a substantial 
proportion required mechanical ventilation or central ve-
nous catheters or gastrostomy tubes (Table 1). Initial posi-
tive cultures were from blood (31/51, 61%), bile (3/51, 
6%), urine (4/51, 8%), respiratory specimens (4/51, 8%), 
wounds (3/51, 6%), catheter tips (2/51, 4%), and 1 each 
from bone, ear, jejunal biopsy sample, and skin. The 30-
day mortality rate was 14/51 (27%), and the 90-day rate 
was 23/51 (45%). For those with initial isolates from blood, 
the 30-day mortality rate was 12/31 (39%) and the 90-day 
rate was 18/31 (58%). The number of deaths attributable to 
C. auris infection is unknown.
Surveillance Cultures
As part of point prevalence surveys and contact investiga-
tions, we performed 1,136 screening cultures for C. auris 
colonization for 572 persons not known to be infected and 
who resided in or were admitted to 19 facilities (9 hospitals; 
10 LTCFs, of which 7 were VSNFs), 4 healthcare workers, 
and 4 family members of 1 clinical case-patient. At least 1 
culture was positive for C. auris for 61 (11%) persons at 
12 (60%) facilities (5 hospitals and 7 LTCFs [including 5

the time of sample collection, 19 (31%) of these 61 per-
sons were admitted to hospitals and 42 (67%) resided at 
LTCFs (40 [66%] at VSNFs). Culture results were positive 
for 13% of those who were tested while living at LTCFs 
and 8% of those in hospitals. 
For 38 persons (clinical and screening case-patients), 
follow-up cultures were performed, either for clinical rea-
sons or to determine whether they remained colonized. 
Long-term colonization was common (Figure 3).
Of 346 persons for whom nares and composite ax-
illa–groin samples for culture were collected on the same 
day, results were positive for at least 1 site for 36 (10%). 
Of these 36, results were positive for both sites for 14 
(39%), at axilla–groin only for 13 (36%), and at nares 
only for 9 (25%).
Environmental Cultures and PCR
Of 781 environmental samples from 20 facilities (12 hospi-
tals and 8 LTCFs [5 VSNFs]), 62 (8%) from 15 facilities (9 
hospitals and 6 LTCFs [4 VSNFs]) were positive for C. au-
ris by culture. In addition, 19 samples from 4 facilities were 
positive by PCR; culture results for 3 of these 4 facilities 
were also positive. Contamination of surfaces and objects 
in case-patients’ rooms and mobile equipment outside the 
rooms was common (Table 2). High-yield items included

Laboratory Identification of Clinical Isolates
From July 2016 through April 30, 2017, NYSDOH re-
ceived 99 first isolates of a variety of yeasts from 99 per-
sons, which clinical laboratories had sent for testing for C. 
auris (Table 3). Of those, 51 (52%) isolates were deter-
mined to be C. auris and represent the 51 clinical cases. Of 
the 99 isolates, 38 had been initially identified by the clini-
cal laboratory as C. haemulonii, but NYSDOH determined 
35 of those to be C. auris. Of 13 yeasts received with no 
identification, 11 were determined to be C. auris, and of 
6 received with a preliminary identification of C. auris, 5 
were confirmed as such.
Susceptibility to Antifungal Medications
Of 51 initial C. auris isolates recovered from clinical case-
patients, 50 (98%) were resistant to fluconazole (Table 4) 
and 13 (25%) were resistant to fluconazole and amphoteri-
cin B. No initial isolates were resistant to echinocandins, 
although subsequent isolates obtained from 3 persons 
who had received an echinocandin acquired resistance to 
it. According to whole-genome sequencing at CDC, 50 
(98%) of 51 isolates belonged to a South Asia clade (25); 
the other less related isolate was the only isolate suscep-
tible to fluconazole.
Infection Control 
Infection control assessments were conducted at 14 
 
LTCFs and 12 hospitals affected by C. auris. Adherence to 
recommended infection control practices, such as implemen-
tation of contact precautions, varied. Specific observations 
were made in the areas of hand hygiene, contact precautions, 
use of personal protective equipment (PPE), and environmen-
tal cleaning and disinfection.
Hand hygiene problems included frequent suboptimal 
availability of alcohol-based hand sanitizers. Sanitizers 
were completely absent in 1 LTCF.
A common problem with implementation of contact 
precautions was ineffective signage. One facility had no 
signs or other effective systems to identify persons around 
whom contact precautions should be taken. Compliance 
with signs that consisted only of instructions to see the 
nurse before entering was poor. In one instance, a physician 
entered a room with such a sign and provided care without 
donning PPE; when questioned, he stated, “I don’t see an 
isolation sign.”
Problems with PPE use included lack of knowledge 
about which PPE was indicated, improper donning and 
doffing (e.g., gowns not covering shoulders or not being 
tied), and lack of availability of appropriate PPE. In 1 
LTCF, PPE was locked in a closet; in another, the PPE 
carts were empty and staff were unable to locate supplies 
to replenish them; in a third, aprons were used instead 
of gowns.
Environmental cleaning and disinfection observations 
included use of household cleaners instead of Environ-
mental Protection Agency–registered hospital-grade dis-
infectants (at some LTCFs), use of disinfectants without 
appropriate label claims, inadequate disinfection of shared 
equipment, and lack of knowledge of contact times.

 Candida auris in Healthcare Facilities, USA
Discussion
This large, citywide, multiple-institution outbreak of C. 
auris infections is ongoing. As of February 2018, most 
confirmed clinical cases in the United States had been 
identified in New York, and case numbers continue to 
grow. The reasons for the preponderance of cases in 
New York are unknown; possibilities include a true 
higher prevalence from multiple introductions into this 
international port of entry, more complete detection 
from aggressive case finding, presence of a large inter-
connected network of healthcare facilities in NYC, or a 
combination of all 3 factors.
Transmission is ongoing in healthcare facilities, pri-
marily among patients with extensive healthcare exposures. 
C. auris has been cultured from rooms and equipment in 
multiple facilities, and close contacts of case-patients have 
become colonized. Infection control lapses have probably 
amplified this process.

*A total of 660 samples were collected from surfaces, objects, and equipment in the rooms of C. auris case-patients and from mobile equipment outside 
the rooms on the affected nursing units. In addition, 62 samples from surfaces within the nursing units but outside the patient rooms and 23 samples from 
outside the affected nursing units were negative by culture and PCR. The location of 36 samples could not be ascertained; 2 were positive by culture.

 RESEARCH
Factors that contribute to transmission may include 
prolonged colonization of clinical and screening case-pa-
tients and environmental contamination. Persistent colo-
nization of affected persons and the lack of an accepted 
decolonization regimen result in a large reservoir of per-
sons carrying the organism. As Welsh et al. (15) demon-
strated, C. auris can remain viable on inanimate surfaces 
for long periods, necessitating scrupulous environmental 
cleaning and disinfection. Affected patients frequently 
have extensive contact with multiple healthcare facilities, 
highlighting the value of careful and thorough communi-
cation at transfer.
The clinical cases in the New York outbreak are simi-
lar to clinical cases described elsewhere. Fungemia is a 
commonly reported clinical infection; 76% of infections 
reported in a series from Colombia (9) and 58% in a series 
from India (4) were bloodstream infections. These per-
centages are comparable to the findings from this New 
York series in which 61% of initial clinical isolates were 
from blood. Among medically fragile patients in NYC 
who had a history of extensive contact with healthcare 
facilities, clinicians should include C. auris in the differ-
ential diagnosis for patients with symptoms compatible 
with bloodstream infection.
Limitations of this investigation include the inability 
to determine where C. auris was acquired for most cases 
because of multiple healthcare exposures. Point prevalence 
surveys have not yet been conducted at all involved facili-
ties. The best uses for and interpretation of PCR results are 
still being determined, especially when PCR is positive but 
culture result is negative. This investigation did not assess 
transmission in the community or outpatient settings; other 
investigators have described C. auris infections associated 
with an outpatient clinic (12).
Given the consequences of the development and 
spread of multidrug-resistant bacteria over the past sev-
eral decades, the prospect of an endemic or epidemic 
multidrug-resistant yeast in US healthcare facilities is 
troubling. Data from other countries show that C. auris 
can become established within facilities. Chowdhary et al.

(2) report that C. auris accounted for 5% of candidemia 
cases in a pediatric hospital and 30% in a tertiary general 
hospital in India. Chakrabarti et al. (6) report that C. auris 
was isolated from 19 of 27 intensive care units throughout 
India and accounted for 5.2% of Candida isolates from 
intensive care units. Okinda et al. (26) report that 38% 
of candidemia cases at a referral hospital in Africa were 
caused by C. auris, surpassing C. albicans cases (27%). 
Schelenz et al. (10) describe an outbreak in a London hos-
pital that affected 50 patients.
Infection control lapses observed during site visits 
prompted NYSDOH leadership to conduct educational 
 
webinars for New York state clinicians and onsite infection 
control–focused reviews of all nonfederal hospitals and 
LTCFs in Brooklyn and Queens. NYSDOH also created 
a web page for healthcare personnel and the public (27). 
Intensive infection prevention and control efforts continue; 
the goals are delaying endemicity, preventing outbreaks 
within facilities, reducing transmission and geographic 
spread, and blunting the effect of C. auris in New York and 
the rest of the United States.
