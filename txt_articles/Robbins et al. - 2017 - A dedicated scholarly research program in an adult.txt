A dedicated scholarly research program in
an adult and pediatric neurology residency
program
ABSTRACT
Objective: To describe and assess the effectiveness of a formal scholarly activity program for
a highly integrated adult and pediatric neurology residency program.
Methods: Starting in 2011, all graduating residents were required to complete at least one form
of scholarly activity broadly defined to include peer-reviewed publications or presentations at sci-
entific meetings of formally mentored projects. The scholarly activity program was administered
by the associate residency training director and included an expanded journal club, guided men-
torship, a required grand rounds platform presentation, and annual awards for the most scholarly
and seminal research findings. We compared scholarly output and mentorship for residents grad-
uating within a 5-year period following program initiation (2011–2015) and during the preceding
5-year preprogram baseline period (2005–2009).
Results: Participation in scholarship increased from the preprogram baseline (24 of 53 graduating
residents, 45.3%) to the postprogram period (47 of 57 graduating residents, 82.1%, p ,
0.0001). Total scholarly output more than doubled from 49 activities preprogram (0.92/resident)
to 139 postprogram (2.44/resident, p 5 0.0002). The proportions of resident participation
increased for case reports (20.8% vs 66.7%, p , 0.0001) and clinical research (17.0% vs
38.6%, p 5 0.012), but were similar for laboratory research and topical reviews. The mean
activities per resident increased for published abstracts (0.15 6 0.41 to 1.26 6 1.41, p ,
0.0001), manuscripts (0.75 6 1.37 to 1.00 6 1.40, p 5 0.36), and book chapters (0.02 6
0.14 to 0.18 6 0.60, p 5 0.07). Rates of resident participation as first authors increased from
30.2% to 71.9% (p , 0.0001). The number of individual faculty mentors increased from 36
(preprogram) to 44 (postprogram).
Conclusions: Our multifaceted program, designed to enhance resident and faculty engagement in
scholarship, was associated with increased academic output and an expanded mentorship pool.
The program was particularly effective at encouraging presentations at scientific meetings.
Longitudinal analysis will determine whether such a program portfolio inspires an increase in
academic careers involving neuroscience-oriented research. Neurology® 2017;88:1366–1370
GLOSSARY
ACGME 5 Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education.
Although scholarly activity programs have been described in many graduate educational set-
tings,1–7 they have not been examined in the setting of neurology residency programs. Increasing
the scholarly participation of neurology residents is important to promote and inspire academic
careers during training. It may also lead to better understanding of neurologic subspecialty
content, technological modalities, and seminal advances in neuroscience research involving
disease pathogenesis, risk stratification, differential diagnosis, earlier disease detection, and
therapeutics. Scholarly activity participation may also enhance familiarity with research meth-
odology, which can provide skills for a research career and judging the literature for studies
relevant to neurologic practice.8
According to an expert consensus and a study of promotion criteria at academic medical in-
stitutions, core components of scholarly activity in graduate medical education should include

 discovery (advancing knowledge), integration
(synthesizing knowledge), application (apply-
ing existing knowledge), and teaching (dissem-
inating current medical knowledge).9 The
Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical
Education (ACGME) specifies examples of
resident scholarship including “participation
in research; publication and presentation at
national and regional meetings; preparation
and presentation of neurologic topics at educa-
tional conferences and programs; organization
and administration of educational programs;
and activity related to professional leadership.
Peer-review
activities
and

care
programming
are
additional
examples
of
scholarship.”10
Scholarly activity is a requirement by the
ACGME for all trainees participating in resi-
dency and fellowship programs.11 The core
components feature the following guidelines:
“The curriculum must advance residents’
knowledge of the basic principles of research,
including how research is conducted, evalu-
ated, explained to patients, and applied to
patient care. Residents should participate in
scholarly activity. The sponsoring institution
and program should allocate adequate educa-
tional resources to facilitate resident involvement
in scholarly activities.”11 Scholarly activity partic-
ipation is also a component of the Level 5
distinction in the disease-type (subspecialty)
ACGME Neurology Milestones.12 Scholarly
activity participation has been associated with
greater satisfaction with residency training.13
Conversely, uncertainty about scholarly activity
definitions and expectations during residency
training may limit successful productivity.14 Par-
ticipation in scholarly activity during residency
training does not compromise clinical workflow
and may be associated with superior clinical
performance.15
We aimed to describe and assess the effec-
tiveness of a formal scholarly activity program
on the adult and pediatric neurology residency
programs at our institution. We hypothesized
that requiring scholarly activity by all residents
in the context of a well-organized, adminis-
tered program would lead to an increase in
scholarly productivity within our training pro-
gram. Specifically, we hypothesized that schol-
arly output and mentorship for residents
graduating
in
2011–2015
(postprogram)
would exceed that of graduates in 2005–
2009 (preprogram).
METHODS Setting. We studied the effect of a standardized
scholarly activity program in the highly integrated adult and pediat-
ric neurology residency programs at our institution, including Mon-
tefiore Medical Center and the Albert Einstein College of Medicine,
in the Bronx, New York. Typically there are 9 positions per year in
the adult program and 2 positions annually in the pediatric pro-
gram. We initiated the program as an optional module for the grad-
uating class of 2010 (phase-in), and it became a required program
component beginning with the 2011 graduating class.
Program components. The scholarly activity requirement stip-
ulates that each resident must complete at least one form of schol-
arly activity. We defined scholarly activity as the production of
peer-reviewed publications, presentations at scientific meetings,
and authored book chapters/textbooks. Residents within our
institution are required to participate in mentored activities and
a substantial amount of the activity had to be performed during
the 3 years of residency training. The program was formally
administered
by
an
associate
residency
training
program
director (M.S.R.). Components included an expanded journal
club led by 2 investigators (S.R.H., R.B.L.) during which
resident projects were discussed in workshop form, guided
mentorship, a required grand rounds platform presentation
before graduation, and the presentation of annual awards for
the most scholarly and seminal research findings, as judged by
a faculty awards committee. Residents were permitted (though
not mandated) to use elective rotations supervised by their
mentors to work on scholarly activity, though not at the
expense of required clinical activities. Other components
included referral of residents to appropriate faculty mentors,
regular monitoring of research progress, support from the
department chair for mentoring by faculty, and collaboration
between subspecialty and general neurology divisions and well
as other clinical and basic science departments.
Outcome assessment. Data were compared for residents graduat-
ing in 2011–2015 (postprogram) vs graduates in 2005–2009
(preprogram). We compared the proportion of residents with scholarly
output; the total output, the number, type, and presentation/
publication venue of activities per resident; the number and proportion
of residents as first authors of abstracts and publications; and the
number of faculty mentors in comparison across the 2 epochs.
Data were directly abstracted from residency program admin-
istrative records into a Microsoft (Redmond, WA) Excel database.
The data were summarized using descriptive statistics (percen-
tages or means with SD). Categorical data were compared using
x2 or a 2-tailed Fisher exact test, and continuous data by an
unpaired t test. Statistical significance was defined as a p value
less than or equal to 0.05.
Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient
consents. Our institutional review board approved this study as
educational research not requiring informed consent.
RESULTS Sample overview, participation, and total
output. Scholarly output from 110 residents was ana-
lyzed, including 90 adult and 20 pediatric neurology
residents. Residents were divided into groups that
completed training prior to program initiation (n 5
53) and after the start of the program (n 5 57). The

 proportion of residents participating in at least one
scholarly activity was higher following program initi-
ation in comparison with preprogram baseline
(82.5% vs 45.3%, p , 0.0001). Of the 10 postpro-
gram residents who did not generate scholarly output,
the reasons included lack of participation or noncom-
pliance with the program (n 5 5, only 1 resident
since 2012), work that was rejected for presentation
or publication (n 5 3), work that remained unfin-
ished (n 5 1), and work focused on a project pre-
ceding neurology residency (n 5 1). The total
scholarly output more than doubled, from 49 activi-
ties preprogram (0.92/resident) to 139 activities post-
program (2.44/resident, p 5 0.0002).
Scholarly activity type and venue. Resident participa-
tion significantly increased for case reports and clini-
cal research, whereas there were no significant
differences in dedicated laboratory research and pro-
duction of scholarly reviews (table 1). Activity per
resident increased significantly in abstracts presented
at scientific meetings, with increases in peer-reviewed
literature
and
book
publications
not
reaching
statistical significance (table 2).
Authorship and mentorship. Proportions of residents
who generated a first-authored abstract presentation
or publication increased from 30.2% preprogram to
71.9% postprogram (p , 0.0001). The number of
participating faculty mentors increased from 36
preprogram to 44 postprogram. Seventeen faculty
members were mentors across both epochs. The
mentor:
resident
ratio
increased
from
0.68
preprogram to 0.77 postprogram.
DISCUSSION Our formalized scholarly activity pro-
gram, designed to enhance resident and faculty
engagement in scholarship, was associated with
increased scholarly output and an expanded mentor-
ship pool. The program was particularly effective at
encouraging abstract presentations at scientific meet-
ings. Resident participation in authoring case reports
more than tripled and clinical research more than
doubled.
It may be intuitive that requiring scholarly activity
among trainees would lead to an increase among res-
idents’ scholarly output. However, our experience
demonstrates that a modest investment in promoting
scholarship dramatically increased the magnitude of
scholarly participation and volume well beyond
the minimal requirements of the program. The
increased proportion of residents presenting abstracts
at annual scientific meetings may have an important
effect on trainee scholarly activity itself as a forum for
improving the content and format of their presenta-
tion as well as an opportunity for academic collabo-
ration.
Other
potential
benefits
for
trainees
presenting at scientific meetings include formal and
informal networking opportunities for future educa-
tional and academic pursuits.
We also observed that the majority of postprogram
residents participated in presenting or publishing case
reports, many of whom also produced other forms of
scholarly activity. Case reports uniquely provide sci-
entific and educational value. They permit scientific
discovery, including enhanced recognition and de-
scriptions of clinical signs and diseases that may be
rare, complex, or previously overlooked. They may
also report unanticipated benefits and serious adverse
effects of therapies, and allow for the study of disease
mechanisms.16 The educational benefits of case report
participation may include developing skills in obser-
vation, pattern recognition, hypothesis generation,
organization, and writing.17 Successful case report
writing and completion to abstract presentation or

 publication may potentially motivate trainees to pur-
sue more complex forms of scholarly activity during
their training and afterwards in their careers.
Administrative and organizational factors may
contribute to the success of such an initiative. An
associate residency program director administered
our program, though other administration models
have been described, including employing a postdoc-
toral researcher to assist faculty and trainees in trans-
lating
clinical
questions
into
tangible
research
projects, applying for regulatory approval, procuring
funds, and networking.18 Programs lacking adminis-
trative resources or framework may look to resident-
led scholarly activity initiatives for inspiration.19 Our
residency program permitted elective time in research
supervised by individual mentors. Other training pro-
grams have established formal research rotations that
have also been associated with increasing scholarly
output.20,21 We also utilized our journal club to work-
shop some residents’ research projects. Though our
program utilizes academic half-days, which have been
employed in most Canadian neurology residency pro-
grams,22 we did not specifically use them to discuss
scholarly activity planning or research methodology,
but may do so in the future. Since the conclusion of
this study, we have expanded this program to our
fellowship training programs and have initiated
a searchable, online departmental database of schol-
arly projects that can be browsed by trainees. One
program has described an incentivized system for res-
idents, where points generated by institutional review
board approval, manuscript submission, and accep-
tance of research projects are converted to a monetary
amount used for individual academic enrichment.23
Our study had limitations. It was difficult to
account for the broad pattern of increasing scholarly
output among trainees in the current era and the
potential for increased scholarly activity production
based on already developed preresidency skillsets.
We did not account for research background prior
to residency initiation as a predetermined variable.
Though much of our department appreciated a major
culture change with increasing resident and faculty
scholarship, we did not formally assess for satisfaction
by residents and mentors within our program. The
denominator of total faculty members across the 2 pe-
riods was dynamic and a true proportion of faculty
involvement could not be accurately assessed.
It may be difficult to generalize the results of our
program to other training environments. Funding
for residents to travel to scientific meetings to present
their work may vary and may limit abstract submis-
sions. Smaller neurology residency programs and
departments may feature diminished faculty mentor-
ship pools, administrative framework, and ability to
provide assistance for trainees who wish to travel to
scientific meetings and have their clinical responsibil-
ities covered. We also grouped together adult and
pediatric neurology residents in our program, who
frequently share academic and clinical activities,
though this may not be applicable to other programs.
Finally, residents were not primary investigators in
clinical trials as a part of our scholarly activity pro-
gram, likely because of factors related to logistics
and expertise. However, clinical trial design, execu-
tion, and interpretation are a fundamental aspect of
any clinical research curriculum and may need special
attention to complement our initiative.
Our study suggests that a scholarly activity pro-
gram for a neurology residency may be feasible to
implement and successful in producing a robust vol-
ume of presentations and publications. An unan-
swered but important question generated by our
study is whether such a program portfolio inspires
an increase in academic careers involving research.
