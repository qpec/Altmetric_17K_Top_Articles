with headache

Abstract
Caffeinated headache medications, either alone or in combination with other treatments, are widely used by
patients with headache. Clinicians should be familiar with their use as well as the chemistry, pharmacology, dietary
and medical sources, clinical benefits, and potential safety issues of caffeine. In this review, we consider the role
of caffeine in the over-the-counter treatment of headache. The MEDLINE and Cochrane databases were searched
by combining “caffeine” with the terms “headache,” “migraine,” and “tension-type.” Studies that were not placebo-
controlled or that involved medications available only with a prescription, as well as those not assessing patients
with migraine and/or tension-type headache (TTH), were excluded. Compared with analgesic medication alone,
combinations of caffeine with analgesic medications, including acetaminophen, acetylsalicylic acid, and ibuprofen,
showed significantly improved efficacy in the treatment of patients with TTH or migraine, with favorable tolerability
in the vast majority of patients. The most common adverse events were nervousness (6.5%), nausea (4.3%),
abdominal pain/discomfort (4.1%), and dizziness (3.2%). This review provides evidence for the role of caffeine as
an analgesic adjuvant in the acute treatment of primary headache with over-the-counter drugs, caffeine doses of
130 mg enhance the efficacy of analgesics in TTH and doses of ≥100 mg enhance benefits in migraine. Additional
studies are needed to assess the relationship between caffeine dosing and clinical benefits in patients with TTH
and migraine.

Review
Approximately 11% of adults worldwide have migraine
[1, 2], a chronic neurologic disorder characterized by
episodic attacks of head pain accompanied by autonomic
symptoms as well as sensitivity to light and sounds.
Migraine differs from tension-type headache (TTH), a
more common condition that is characterized by mild to
moderate headache with few or no associated symptoms
[3]. Globally, at least 40% of adults meet criteria for
TTH [2]. Both conditions account for substantial rates
of absenteeism and lost productivity at work, home, and
school, imposing a significant burden on both individ-
uals and society [2].
Most people with migraine or TTH treat their acute
headache episodes with medications. Worldwide, more
than half of the patients with migraine (57%) or TTH
(>80%) choose over-the-counter (OTC) medications to
manage their condition, rather than prescription treat-
ments [4, 5]. For migraine, this treatment approach
might be partially explained by the wide spectrum of
symptom severity from person-to-person and attack-to-
attack, ranging from mild pain with little disability to
severe pain with complete disability [6]. TTH is typically
not
associated
with
debilitating
pain
or
functional
impairment [2, 3].
In comparison with to OTC medications, prescription
drugs are more costly, and are more likely to have more
contraindications or undesirable side effects [7–9].
OTC medications can be used without the need for
medical consultation [2]. In addition, a number of OTC
agents have established efficacy in well-controlled trials
in TTH and migraine, including acetaminophen (APAP)
[10] and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs),
such as acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) [11] and ibuprofen
(IBU) [12, 13]. There are also fixed combinations that
combine analgesics with caffeine. Two such combinations

 that have demonstrated efficacy for patients with TTH
or migraine are APAP 500 mg, ASA 500 mg, and caf-
feine 130 mg per 2-tablet dose (AAC-130) and APAP
400 mg, ASA 500 mg, and caffeine 100 mg per 2-tablet
dose (AAC-100). As a result, evidence-based guidelines
for the acute treatment of migraine and TTH recognize
that OTC drugs are safe and effective treatment options
for many patients [8, 14]. These guidelines also recognize
that analgesics combined with caffeine, such as AAC-130
and AAC-100, have important advantages compared
with other widely used OTCs, such as APAP, ASA, and
IBU alone.
Caffeinated agents have been in worldwide use by
headache patients, either alone or in combination with
other treatments, for decades. Clinicians should be
familiar with the therapeutic benefits and limitations
associated with the use of these agents in clinical
practice. Here we review the use of caffeine in primary
headache management. We begin by reviewing the
sources and consumption of caffeine as well as its
chemical properties and pharmacology, clinical use,
and safety. Next, we review studies of caffeine in the
acute treatment of patients with TTH and migraine.
Caffeine background
Sources and consumption
Caffeine is the most widely consumed psychoactive agent
in the world [Citation removed]. It occurs naturally in
more than 60 plant species, including tea, kola nuts, coffee
beans, mate leaves, guarana plants, and cocoa nuts [15]. In
humans, the most common sources of caffeine are dietary,
as shown in Table 1 [16], although various medications
also contain caffeine. Much of the caffeine used commer-
cially is a byproduct of the production of decaffeinated
coffee [17, 18].
Worldwide, approximately 80% of adults consume a
caffeinated product every day [19], although daily mean
consumption rates vary considerably by country. China
(16 mg) and Kenya (50 mg) are at the low end of
caffeine consumption and Brazil (300 mg) and Denmark
(390) are at the high end [15]. In the United States, the
vast majority of adults are regular caffeine users (90%),
and estimates of daily consumption range from 168 to
220 mg [15].
Chemistry and pharmacology
Caffeine, the common name for 1,3,7-trimethylxanthine,
is
a
purine
alkaloid
with
the
molecular
formula
C8H10N4O2, a molecular weight of 194.1906 g/mol, and
the molecular structure of a trimethyl xanthine (Fig. 1)
[18]. Pure caffeine takes the form of white, prismatic
crystals; it is odorless, has a slightly bitter taste, and is
slightly acidic, with a pH of 6.9 (1% solution) [18].
Caffeine is completely absorbed by the intestinal tract
(ie, its bioavailability is 100%) [20] and it is highly sol-
uble in water as well as a range of non-polar organic
solvents [21]. When administered orally, caffeine takes
30–120 min to reach maximum plasma concentration,
although food can slow the absorption process [15].
Caffeine crosses both the blood-brain and placental
barriers [22] and it is secreted in human milk, saliva,
bile, and semen [21]. About 95% of a caffeine dose is
metabolized in the liver via cytochrome P450 (CYP1A2
demethylation),
which
converts
it
into
paraxanthine
(85%), theobromine (10%) and theophylline (5%) [23, 24].
Less than 2% of a caffeine dose is eliminated unchanged in
urine [23]. In adults, caffeine’s elimination half-life is 3–
5 h, but it is doubled in smokers and non-coffee drinkers;
in newborns, the half-life of caffeine is estimated to be
100 h [21, 23].
The effects of caffeine on nociception are primarily
attributed to its nonselective antagonism of the adenosine
A1, A2A, and A2B receptors (as caffeine and adenosine
possess a similar molecular structure) and its slightly
lower-affinity antagonism for the adenosine A3 receptor

Fig. 1 Molecular structure of caffeine [18]. The molecular structure
of caffeine indicates that it is a part of a group of compounds called
trimethyl xanthines, which also includes theobromine and theophylline

 [23, 25]. Through antagonism of the A2A, and A2B recep-
tors, adenosine induces vasodilation [26, 27]. To combat
increased antagonism of these receptors and vasodilation
in chronic caffeine users, adenosine receptors are upregu-
lated resulting in vascoconstrictive effects [28]. Addition-
ally, the mechanism by which the adjuvant effects of
caffeine occur is not well established although studies have
shown that caffeine does not reduce prostaglandin synthe-
sis, a previously suggested mechanism of action [29].
Caffeine
dosing
influences
its
pharmacodynamic
effects. Higher doses (75–100 mg kg−1) involve central
noradrenergic mechanisms, medium to high doses (10–
35 mg kg−1) activate central amine systems, and low
doses (5 mg kg−1) interacting with central cholinergic
mechanisms [30]. At therapeutic doses (ie, 100 times
those typical in dietary consumption), caffeine can also
induce phosphodiesterase inhibition, Ca2+ release, and
GABAA receptor blockade [23, 30].
Medical applications
Among patients with headache conditions, caffeine is
used as an analgesic adjuvant. Analgesic adjuvants do
not relieve pain by themselves, but augment the action
of a known analgesic [31]. Factorial studies that exam-
ined the effect of analgesics alone, caffeine alone, and
the combination of an analgesic and caffeine are re-
quired to assess its role as an analgesic adjuvant. In a
1984 meta-analysis of 30 such studies with more than
10,000 patients with postpartum uterine cramping, episi-
otomy pain, postsurgical pain, or headache, Laska et al.,
compared AAC-130 with APAP, ASA, and APAP + ASA
to assess the therapeutic effect of caffeine as an analgesic
adjuvant [32]. The estimated relative potency was 1.41
(95% CI; 1.23–1.63), indicating that caffeine significantly
enhanced the analgesic effect of ASA, APAP, or a com-
bination of the two by about 40% [32].
There is some evidence that caffeine monotherapy is as-
sociated with more pain relief than placebo in treating
samples that include either migraine alone or persons with
migraine or TTH [33, 34]. There is also limited evidence
for the therapeutic use of caffeine monotherapy in patients
with other primary and secondary headaches. For ex-
ample, in patients with post-dural puncture headache
(PDPH), studies have shown that acute use of 300 mg
(oral) and 500 mg (intravenous) caffeine can provide relief
[35]. A Cochrane review concluded that these doses of
caffeine were superior to placebo at reducing the propor-
tion of participants with PDPH persistence, as well as
those needing supplementary interventions [35]. However,
lower doses of caffeine (75 mg or 125 mg) combined with
APAP 500 mg given every 6 h for 3 days have been shown
to be ineffective for prophylaxis of PDPH [35], and a
review of controlled and open-label studies investigating
prophylaxis and treatment of PDPH with oral or IV
caffeine cited methodologically weak trials and a pau-
city of reliable results in concluding that the use of
caffeine as an antinociceptive agent for prevention or
treatment of patients with PDPH is insufficiently sup-
ported by the available pharmacological and clinical
evidence [36]. In patients with hypnic headache, an
uncommon condition in elderly patients featuring ste-
reotyped attacks of nocturnal headache for which out-
comes from controlled studies are lacking, a review of
data from observational studies found that the most
effective acute treatment is caffeine (given either as 40–
60 mg tablets or as a cup of coffee) [37].
When combined with analgesics, caffeine produces a
range of clinical effects in these patients. Caffeine pro-
motes the absorption of analgesics, including APAP, ASA,
and IBU [38–40]. This effect is attributed to rapid lower-
ing of gastric pH. At low doses (≤10 mg kg−1), caffeine has
been shown to inhibit the antinociceptive effects of APAP
[41], amitriptyline [42], carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine
[43]. At higher doses (10–35 mg kg−1), caffeine enhances
pain relief with APAP [44, 45] and several different
NSAIDs [46, 47]. Meta-analyses of caffeine combined with
APAP, ASA, or IBU have found only weak adjuvant effects
in patients with postoperative pain [48, 49].
Coadministration of caffeine can have other effects
that are relevant for patients taking analgesics, including
interfering with the effectiveness of some therapies. For
instance, a 200-mg caffeine dose can inhibit the anal-
gesic effects of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimula-
tion [50], and consuming caffeine within 2–4 h of
intravenous adenosine therapy for paroxysmal supraven-
tricular tachycardia has been shown to necessitate the
use of higher adenosine doses [51].
Caffeine has a wide range of physiologic effects that
are unrelated to the direct treatment of headache pain
but may influence improvement in headache symptoms.
Multiple studies have shown that caffeine can enhance
mood, alertness [23, 52–55]; exercise performance [56, 57];
the speed at which information is processed, awareness, at-
tention, and reaction time [58, 59].
Caffeine also increases gastric motility, as measured by
pressure waves and propagated contractions in transverse/
descending colon. The magnitude of the effect of caffein-
ated coffee is similar to eating a meal, 60% stronger than
water, and 23% stronger than decaffeinated coffee [60].
Pharmacokinetic studies have shown that the absorption
of caffeine is related to gastric emptying [61]. This effect
of caffeine has important clinical implications for people
with migraines, who may experience reductions in gastric
motility both during and between attacks [62]. This reduc-
tion in gastric motility slows the absorption of acute medi-
cations and reduces their effectiveness [63]. In addition,
widely used migraine-specific therapies, including the oral
and injectable formulations of sumatriptan, significantly
Lipton et al. The Journal of Headache and Pain  (2017) 18:107

 decrease gastric motility in healthy volunteers [64–68],
potentially exacerbating disease-related gastroparesis and,
perhaps, decreasing or delaying oral absorption of triptans
resulting in lower efficacy in more advanced attacks of
migraine.
Safety
In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration
considers caffeine a substance generally recognized as
safe (GRAS) when used in 1) cola-type beverages in ac-
cordance with good manufacturing practice and 2)
stimulant drug products [69–71]. The caffeine contained
in OTC analgesics is limited to a dose of 64–65 mg per
tablet though two tablet doses are common [69–72]. In
clinical trials, caffeinated analgesics were generally well
tolerated and caused the types of mild and transient ad-
verse events (eg, upset stomach) that might be expected
from single doses of analgesics at OTC doses [33, 34, 73,
74]. For example, one meta-analysis estimated that add-
ing caffeine to analgesics significantly increased the
number of patients who experienced nervousness and
dizziness (relative risk 1.60) [75].
Studies also suggest that caffeine stimulates gastric acid
production and relaxes the lower esophageal sphincter
[76], increasing the risk of gastric and duodenal ulcers
[77, 78] as well as gastroesophageal reflux disease [79].
However, a meta-analysis of studies enrolling more
than 8000 healthy subjects detected no significant asso-
ciation between coffee intake and acid-related upper
gastroduodenal ulcer diseases, including gastric and
duodenal ulcers, reflux esophagitis, and non-erosive reflux
disease [80]. The authors speculated that the known pro-
tective effects of coffee (relaxing effect, antioxidant effect,
phytochemical effects) might outweigh the risks of in-
creased gastric acid secretion [80].
When used in patients with renal failure, caffeine re-
quires no dose adjustment [12]. However, as a matter
of good clinical judgment, it is prudent to consider all
analgesics
potentially
nephrotoxic
and
to
counsel
against excessive, protracted use [46, 81]. Excessive use
of phenacetin-containing analgesics can cause renal
papillary necrosis and interstitial nephritis, but there is
no convincing evidence that nonphenacetin-containing
analgesics, including acetaminophen (APAP), aspirin
(ASA), and mixtures of these two compounds, or
NSAIDs, are associated with pathologically or clinically
defined renal disease [82].
The role of caffeine in the treatment of migraine is com-
plex. Caffeine combination products are useful in treating
migraine and other headache types [33–35]. However, an
association between caffeine intake and acute migraines
has been observed [83]. Caffeine withdrawal may precipi-
tate headache in the short term (NEJM) while cessation of
caffeine may be beneficial. This suggests that complete
abstinence of caffeine, like abrupt discontinuation of anal-
gesics for those with MOH headaches [84], may be benefi-
cial to those suffering from migraines [83]. Furthermore,
overuse of APAP/caffeine/ASA has been shown to affect
regional brain
glucose metabolism
in
patients
with
chronic migraine [85].
Potential for overuse
Frequent use of analgesics is an important health problem
[84], and medication overuse by patients with episodic
headache conditions is associated with the development
of chronic headache conditions [86–89]. Avoiding medica-
tion overuse is an important aspect of headache care [3];
once established, medication overuse may be difficult to
treat, and recidivism is common [90]. Some research has
identified dietary and medicinal caffeine consumption,
specifically OTC caffeine combinations, as a modest risk
factor for progression from episodic to chronic headache
[91, 92]. After adjustment for demographic factors, pri-
mary headache type, and number of medications taken,
the association of caffeine-containing combinations, and
opioid-containing combinations as a risk factor for mi-
graine progression was attenuated [92]. Additional sup-
port for the lack of positive association between risk of
migraine chronicity and the appropriate use of caffeine-
analgesic combinations came from the American Migraine
Prevalence and Prevention study, which reported that
AAC-130 had no association with development of chronic
migraine. After adjusting for headache frequency and
medication use, AAC-130 was not associated with an in-
creased risk of chronic migraine onset (OR = 0.87, 95% CI
0.64,1.19) [84]. Acute treatment guidelines recommend
that in all cases and with all acute medications, migrai-
neurs should limit medication use to 2–3 headache days
per week [8]—advice that may apply equally to patients
with TTH [93].
Chronic intake of caffeine can cause a dependence
syndrome [94, 95] that has also been positively associ-
ated with a history of cigarette smoking and problematic
alcohol use [96]. However, compulsive drug-seeking be-
havior
has
never
been
reported
among
caffeine-
dependent persons, and reports of deliberate caffeine
abuse are uncommon [97]. It has been suggested that
the prevalence of caffeine dependence may increase as
a result of the promotion of caffeinated energy drinks
to adolescents [98], and cases of intoxication—charac-
terized by nausea/vomiting, tachycardia, hypertension,
agitation, and dizziness—have been reported [99]. Caf-
feinated energy drinks have also been associated with
seizures [100], stroke [101], and, rarely, death [102].
These drinks are also frequently combined with alcohol,
a combination that has been found to increase alcohol
consumption in laboratory animals [103]. Perhaps as a
consequence, consumption of alcohol mixed with caffeine
Lipton et al. The Journal of Headache and Pain  (2017) 18:107 
Page 4 of 11
 has been found to be associated with high-risk behaviors
such as binge drinking [103].
Tolerance
Tolerance to the effects of caffeine on blood pressure,
heart rate, diuresis, adrenaline and noradrenaline plasma
levels, renin activity, and sleep patterns generally occurs
within a few days [22], and regular daily doses of 750–
1200 mg can lead to tolerance to its subjective, pressor,
and neuroendocrine effects [104–106]. In addition, a
withdrawal syndrome characterized by headache and
sometimes other symptoms (ie, decreased cognitive per-
formance, nausea/vomiting) may occur 12 to 24 h after
stopping chronic consumption of caffeine in about 50%
of patients [22, 31].
Multiple factors, including heritability [107] may
contribute to an individual’s susceptibility to caffeine
withdrawal [108]. The amount of caffeine consumption
required to trigger withdrawal varies; while formal diag-
nostic criteria for caffeine withdrawal headache require
daily consumption of ≥200 mg for at least 2 weeks [1],
symptoms have been observed after sudden termination
of caffeine exposures of 300 mg for 3 days and 100 mg for
7 days [109].
Some evidence suggests that caffeine withdrawal may
play a role in triggering migraine attacks [110], espe-
cially weekend attacks [111]. Data also suggests caffeine
withdrawal plays a role in dialysis headaches, a frequent
complication of hemodialysis [112]. In addition, postopera-
tive headaches may be partially due to caffeine withdrawal
triggered by the abstinence typically required before surgi-
cal procedures [113]. Caffeine withdrawal headache can be
minimized by a staged reduction and elimination of caffeine
intake [97].
Review of randomized trials of OTC analgesics
combined with caffeine in the acute treatment of
migraine and TTH
Methods
To review literature relating to the use of caffeine by pa-
tients with TTH or migraine, research published be-
tween January 1966 and November 2016 was retrieved
from the MEDLINE and Cochrane databases by combin-
ing “caffeine” with each of the following search terms:
“headache” (597), “migraine” (365), and “tension-type”
(52). Studies that were not placebo-controlled or that in-
volved medications available only with a prescription
(eg, butalbital- and ergotamine-caffeine combinations),
as well as those not assessing patients with migraine
and/or TTH, were excluded. A total of 7 placebo-
controlled and factorial trials (2 in patients with TTH, 2
in patients with migraine, and 3 in mixed populations)
were identified for analysis.
Results
Efficacy in TTH
In 4 randomized, double-blind, 2-period crossover
studies involving 1900 patients with TTH, Migliardi
et al. compared AAC-130 with APAP alone and placebo
[74]. Efficacy endpoints included pain intensity differ-
ence (PID), pain relief (PAR), and total pain relief
(TOTPAR). AAC-130 provided significantly greater
PID and PAR than APAP alone (P < .001), and both
active treatments were superior to placebo (P < .001).
As shown in Table 2, the magnitude of the adjuvant
effect from caffeine for the summed pain intensity dif-
ference (SPID), %SPID, and TOTPAR was between 76%
and 97%. For measures of peak analgesia and duration
of analgesia, the effects were 63–85% greater than the
net analgesic effect of APAP monotherapy [74]. Com-
pared with APAP 1000 mg plus placebo, AAC provided
significantly superior total pain relief at 4-h postdose
(P < .001 vs. APAP and placebo) [74].
Because Migliardi et al. only restricted consumption of
dietary caffeine (ie, coffee, tea, soda, chocolate) during
the 4-h study period and found significant adjuvancy at
the high and low ends of consumption, they concluded
that the adjuvant effect was not influenced by patients’
usual caffeine consumption. Since the magnitude of caf-
feine’s adjuvant effect was larger for headache than in
other forms of pain (ie, episiotomy, postsurgical, etc.)
[32], caffeine-containing analgesic combinations may be
particularly effective for headache pain [74].
In a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, multicen-
ter, single-dose, 4-arm, placebo- and active-controlled
study, 301 patients with TTH treated a single attack with
a 2-tablet dose of IBU 400 mg + caffeine 200 mg (IBC-
100), IBU 400 mg alone, caffeine 200 mg alone, or placebo
[34]. IBC-100 demonstrated significantly shorter times to
meaningful improvement in headache relief than IBU
alone or placebo; significantly greater total analgesia than
IBU alone, caffeine alone, or placebo; and significantly
greater peak relief than IBU alone, caffeine alone, or pla-
cebo (P < .05). Significantly more subjects obtained mean-
ingful headache relief with IBC-100 than with IBU alone
or placebo (P < .05). IBC-100 provided greater analgesic
effectiveness than either component alone [51].
Efficacy in migraine
The efficacy of AAC-130 in migraine was established by
Lipton et al. in 3 double-blind, placebo-controlled,
parallel-group studies that randomized a total of 1220
migraineurs, excluding subjects who vomited more than
20% of the time or who usually required bed rest [73].
At 2-h postdose, pain-free rates were 21% for AAC-130
and 7% for placebo, and headache response (pain
reduced from moderate or severe to mild or none) was
59% for AAC-130 and 33% for placebo. At 6-h postdose,
Lipton et al. The Journal of Headache and Pain  (2017) 18:107 
Page 5 of 11
 51% of patients treated with AAC-130 were pain-free
compared with 24% of placebo-treated patients, and 79%
of patients treated with AAC had a headache response
versus 52% of those treated with placebo (P < .001 for all
comparisons). The significant advantages of AAC-130
over placebo were also seen at 2- and 6-h postdose for re-
lief of pain, associated symptoms, and disability (Table 3)
[73]. Vomiting was less frequent in those treated with
AAC-130 (0.2%) than placebo-treated patients (1.6%;
P = .01) [73]. Although this study confirmed that a fixed
combination containing caffeine could effectively treat a
select population of migraineurs, the adjuvant effect of
caffeine could not be assessed because a factorial design
was not used.
In a 3-arm, double-blind, parallel group study of
migraine, Goldstein and coworkers (2006) treated 1555
patients with a fixed combination of AAC (acetamino-
phen 500 mg, acetylsalicylic acid 500 mg, and caffeine
130 mg), IBU 400 mg or placebo. In comparison with
placebo-treated
participants,
both
active
treatment
arms demonstrated better relief of pain and associated
symptoms. AAC was superior to IBU for a number of
endpoints, including TOTPAR at 2 h, time to onset of
meaningful PAR, pain intensity reduction, headache re-
sponse, and pain free. The mean TOTPAR2 scores were
2.7 for AAC, 2.4 for IBU, and 2.0 for placebo (AAC vs
IBU, P < 0.03). The median time to meaningful PAR for
AAC was 20 min earlier than that of IBU (P < 0.036).
The influence of caffeine once again could not be
assessed as this was not a factorial study [114].
Efficacy in mixed populations (TTH and migraine)
Two studies evaluated the efficacy of analgesics and
caffeine in study populations that included patients with
TTH and migraine [33, 115]. In the first, Diener et al.
studied AAC-100 (APAP 200 mg, ASA 250 mg, and caf-
feine 50 mg), which is available OTC in Germany, in pa-
tients with TTH and migraine using a 6-arm, randomized,
double-blind, parallel-group factorial design. The fixed
combination AAC-100 was compared with APAP 200 mg
and ASA 250 mg, APAP alone, ASA alone, caffeine alone
and with placebo in 1743 subjects who typically treated
their headaches with OTC medications [33]. Pain intensity
was recorded on a 100-mm visual analogue scale. Among
enrolled subjects, 84% had migraine, 13% had episodic
TTH, and 3% could not be classified. The primary end-
point was time to 50% pain relief (PAR).
Time to 50% PAR, AAC-100 was significantly better
than the APAP 200 mg-ASA 250 mg combination
(P = .02), ASA 250 mg (P = .04), APAP 200 mg (P = .002),
caffeine 50 mg (P < .0001), and placebo (P < .0001). All
active treatments, except caffeine 50 mg, were significantly
superior to PLA (P < .0001) [33]. The median time to 50%
PAR was 65 min with AAC-100, 73 min with APAP

 200 mg-ASA 250 mg, 79 min with ASA 250 mg, 81 min
with APAP 200 mg, 107 min with caffeine 50 mg, and
133 min with placebo. Additional efficacy results compar-
ing AAC-100 with the analgesic combination without caf-
feine and its constituents are shown in Table 4 [33]. It was
concluded that AAC-100 significantly outperformed all
the other treatments for reductions in pain intensity, and
that the clinically meaningful improvements compared
with APAP or ASA monotherapy confirmed the existence
of an adjuvant effect of caffeine in migraineurs. Diener
et al. also pointed out that, because their patient popula-
tion typically treated their headache attacks with OTCs,
findings can be generalized to the larger population of
migraineurs and patients with TTH [33].
Efficacy in children and adolescents with migraine or TTH
A double-blind, crossover pilot study comparing the effi-
cacy of an IBU-caffeine combination with an IBU-placebo
combination in 12 children (7 girls, 5 boys) aged 7 to
15 years (mean = 11.9 years) who had TTH (25%) or
migraine (75%) was conducted [116]. Study treatments,
adjusted to subjects’ weight, included 100 mg IBU + 50 mg
caffeine; 200 mg IBU + 50 mg caffeine; 300 mg
IBU + 100 mg caffeine; or 400 mg IBU + 100 mg of
caffeine. Baseline pain intensity, which was assessed on a
4-point scale (4 = severe, 3 = moderate, 2 = mild, 1 = no
pain), was 3.8 in the IBU-caffeine treatment group and 4.0
in the IBU-placebo group [116].
A total of 58% of children obtained faster relief with the
IBU-caffeine combination, while 33% appeared to achieve
earlier relief with IBU and placebo, and 8% exhibited no
difference in the response [116]. Time to meaningful relief
(pain intensity ≤2) was about twice as fast (60 min) for at-
tacks treated with IBU-caffeine as it was for those treated
with IBU-placebo (≈120 min). At 30 min postdose, PID in
the IBU-caffeine group was 1.0 compared with 0.2 in the
IBU-placebo group; at 60 min postdose, PID scores were
1.5 for IBU-caffeine and 0.9 for IBU-placebo. Although
the IBU-caffeine combination failed to separate signifi-
cantly on any efficacy endpoint in this small pilot study, it
was numerically superior to the IBU-placebo combination,
and almost 60% of patients realized clinically important
benefits [116].
Tolerability
In these studies, ≥96% of patients reported adverse events
(AEs) [33, 34, 73, 74]. AEs were usually mild or moderate,
and no subject in any study withdrew as a result of an AE
that was considered to be related to active treatment.
Across all studies and patient types, the most commonly
reported treatment-emergent AEs were nervousness (6.5%
[4.0–11.0%]), nausea (4.3% [1.0–7.0%]), abdominal pain/
discomfort (4.1% [1.1–9.0%]), and dizziness (3.2% [0.8–
6.0%]) [33, 34, 73, 74].
Estimate of benefit
Previous meta-analyses have estimated that combining
analgesics and/or NSAIDs with caffeine improves anti-
nociception. In patients with a range of pain conditions,
Laska et al. suggested an adjuvant effect of 1.42 for
AAC-130 compared with APAP or ASA monotherapy
[32]. Migliardi et al. estimated an adjuvant benefit of
1.63–1.97 for AAC-130 versus APAP in patients with
TTH [74]. Zhang found an effect of 1.36 (95% CIs 1.17–
1.58) for APAP-caffeine combinations versus APAP alone
in patients with headache [75]. A Cochrane review of caf-
feine adjuvancy in various pain states reported that the
number needed to treat (NNT) for an additional patient

 to have relief of headache pain was 14 while the NNTs for
postoperative dental pain, postoperative pain, and dys-
menorrhea pain were 13, 16, and 25, respectively. Consid-
ered by dose, 65 mg or less had no adjuvant effect in
postoperative pain, while the NNT for doses of 70–
150 mg was 14, and for doses above 150 mg, the NNT
was 10.164 Overall, there appeared to be a small but clinic-
ally significant benefit to adding caffeine to analgesic ther-
apy for various types of acute pain, but more research is
needed to optimize dosing recommendations [117].
Discussion
This review provides evidence for the role of caffeine as
an analgesic adjuvant in the acute treatment of primary
headache with OTC drugs. A dose of 130 mg enhances
the efficacy of OTC analgesics in TTH and a dose of
≥100 mg enhances the benefits of OTC analgesics in
migraine. The incidence of treatment-emergent AEs in
these studies was low, and the type and severity of AEs
was similar across headache diagnoses. It seems likely
that abdominal pain was probably due to the presence
of NSAIDs (ie, ASA or IBU), while nervousness, nau-
sea, and dizziness were most likely related to consump-
tion of caffeine. These AEs, none of which were severe
or unexpected, suggest that most patients who use
caffeine-containing OTC combinations for occasional,
acute treatment of TTH or migraine will experience
good tolerability with appropriate use.
The relationship between caffeine and headache is com-
plex, paradoxical, and often misunderstood. Used appro-
priately, caffeine significantly enhances the effectiveness of
analgesics and NSAIDs in the treatment of patients with
migraine and TTH. Used to excess, caffeine-containing
analgesics can place patients at risk of medication overuse
headache (MOH) and the progressive development of
chronic TTH or chronic migraine [1]. At the same time,
results from an uncontrolled, clinic-based study suggest
that discontinuing caffeine consumption can improve the
efficacy of acute migraine treatment [83].
Caffeine also has intrinsic antinociceptive properties,
which enable it to be used as a monotherapy for relief of
hypnic headache. However, large acute doses can precipi-
tate headache, as can abrupt cessation after regular dietary
consumption. On the other hand, if addition of caffeine
improves efficacy, it may reduce the number of doses of
acute medication need to successfully treat an attack of
migraine. In addition, patients are often willing to use
OTC products earlier in an attack of headache which
likely improves outcome and may reduce need for further
treatment. The risk of MOH is one of frequency of use.
Appropriate dosing of caffeine in patients with mi-
graine or TTH remains uncertain. Laska et al. suggest
that a caffeine dose of 130 mg may be optimal for
achieving the analgesic adjuvant effect among patients
with headache [32], as lower doses (<60 mg) generally
do not show a reliable adjuvant effect. Further, if low
doses of caffeine inhibit antinociception, dietary caffeine
might interfere with analgesic efficacy [31].
Awareness of the role of caffeine in the management
of patients with headache should facilitate optimal use
and help to avoid or address MOH. In clinical practice,
certain groups of patients may benefit, including those
with a partial response to simple analgesics and migrai-
neurs with prominent gastroparesis-related nausea.
Conclusions
Caffeine is widely consumed around the world in both
food and beverages, and it has a variety of important
medical applications. In patients with headache disor-
ders, caffeine monotherapy may be useful in some forms
of primary or secondary headache. Its principal role is as
an adjuvant in fixed combinations with analgesic medi-
cations for acute treatment of TTH and migraine. Evi-
dence from clinical trials in these patient populations
indicates that combining caffeine with OTC analgesic
medications, such as APAP, ASA, and IBU, significantly
improves efficacy over the analgesic alone. As might be
expected with OTC preparations, tolerability is good for
the vast majority of patients, and AEs are predictable
and almost universally mild and transient. Additional
studies are needed to assess the relationship between
caffeine dosing and clinical benefit in patients with TTH
and migraine.
