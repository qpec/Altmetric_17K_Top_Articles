Abstract.
Background: Research-based exercise interventions improve health-related quality of life (HRQL) and mobility in people
with Parkinson’s disease (PD).
Objective: To examine whether exercise habits were associated with changes in HRQL and mobility over two years.
Methods: We identified a cohort of National Parkinson Foundation Quality Improvement Initiative (NPF-QII) participants
with three visits. HRQL and mobility were measured with the Parkinson’s Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39) and Timed
Up and Go (TUG). We compared self-reported regular exercisers (≥2.5 hours/week) with people who did not exercise
2.5 hours/week. Then we quantified changes in HRQL and mobility associated with 30-minute increases in exercise, across
PD severity, using mixed effects regression models.
Results: Participants with three observational study visits (n = 3408) were younger, with milder PD, than participants with
fewer visits. After 2 years, consistent exercisers and people who started to exercise regularly after their baseline visit

M.R. Rafferty et al. / Regular Exercise, Quality of Life, and Mobility in Parkinson’s Disease
had smaller declines in HRQL and mobility than non-exercisers (p < 0.05). Non-exercisers worsened by 1.37 points on the
PDQ-39 and a 0.47 seconds on the TUG per year. Increasing exercise by 30 minutes/week was associated with slower declines
in HRQL (–0.16 points) and mobility (–0.04 sec). The benefit of exercise on HRQL was greater in advanced PD (–0.41 points)
than mild PD (–0.14 points; p < 0.02).
Conclusions: Consistently exercising and starting regular exercise after baseline were associated with small but significant
positive effects on HRQL and mobility changes over two years. The greater association of exercise with HRQL in advanced
PD supports improving encouragement and facilitation of exercise in advanced PD.

INTRODUCTION
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is associated with pro-
gressive mobility-related impairments that predict
decreased health-related quality of life (HRQL) [1]
and increased mortality [2]. One of the earliest signs
of impaired mobility is decreased walking activity,
which can occur prior to measurable declines in gait
speed or balance [3]. Increasing walking, general
physical activity, and regular exercise are lifestyle
factors that may be associated with better HRQL and
mobility over time in PD [4].
Previously completed studies demonstrate that
a variety of exercise modalities are associated with
improved HRQL and functional mobility in peo-
ple with PD. Examples of these formal, supervised
exercise interventions include progressive resistance
exercise [5, 6], treadmill training [7], Tai Chi [8],
Tango [9], and PD-specific exercise programs [10,
11]. However, few of these clinical trials deliver exer-
cise interventions for greater than 6 months [5, 6,
11]. It is currently unknown whether people with PD
who change or maintain regular exercise behavior,
outside of supervised research-based exercise inter-
ventions, have better HRQL and mobility outcomes
over time.
An
initial
cross-sectional
analysis
from
the
NationalParkinsonFoundationQualityImprovement
Initiative (NPF-QII) clinical study revealed that self-
reported regular exercise was associated with better
mobility, HRQL, and reduced caregiver strain [12].
In that study, participation in exercise was catego-
rized as none, low (less than 2.5 hours per week), or
high (greater or equal to 2.5 hours per week). Greater
or equal to 2.5 hours per week of exercise is signif-
icant because the American Academy of Neurology
has recently updated their quality metrics for people
with PD to include yearly counseling on the impor-
tance of regular exercise, defined as at least 2.5 hours
per week of moderate intensity activity per week [13].
The early analysis of the NPF-QII study indicated
that baseline exercise was a significant predictor of
HRQL, mobility, physical function, caregiver strain,
and disease progression at the one year follow up visit
(N = 2252) [12].
As more data have been collected in the NPF-
QII study, longitudinal analysis provides valuable
information about how exercise relates to long-term
outcomes. The purpose of this analysis is to exam-
ine the extent to which regular exercise impacts
HRQL and functional mobility over 2 years. The
primary objective of this analysis was to identify
whether maintaining regular exercise, or improving
exercise habits to greater or equal to 2.5 hours/week,
shown to be beneficial at baseline [12], was associ-
ated with sustained benefits in HRQL and functional
mobility over 2 years. The other objectives were
to quantify the impact of increasing exercise by
a 30-minute increment per week, and to determine
whether the impact of exercise differed across PD
severity.
METHODS
The NPF-QII is an international, multicenter,
prospective clinical study of care and outcomes that
has recorded data from 21 sites in North Amer-
ica, the Netherlands, and Israel identified as Centers
of Excellence (Centers) by the National Parkinson
Foundation. Information on the development of the
NPF-QII research study has been published previ-
ously [15]. Participants were eligible for the study if
they received medical care for the diagnosis of PD at
one of the participating centers, with no other exclu-
sions. Participants were included in this analysis if
they had data collected during at least 3 annual vis-
its. The Institutional Review Boards at each Center
approved the data collections, and informed consent
was obtained from each participant. De-identified
data collected from August 20, 2009 to September
28, 2015 was used for this analysis.

The NPF-QII study collects demographics, disease
duration, Hoehn and Yahr stage (HY), family his-
tory, brief neuropsychological profile and cognitive
assessments, as well as data on pharmacologic and
non-pharmacologic management of PD symptoms
[15]. These observational study visits are scheduled
on a yearly basis. At each visit, exercise is mea-
sured by the self-reported number of hours per week
of exercise. Additional information regarding the
type and intensity of exercise is not available in this
dataset. The Parkinson Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-
39) measured patient-reported, PD-specific HRQL
[16, 17]. Functional mobility was measured by the
Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, in which perfor-
mance is tested by timing participants as they rise
from a chair, walk 3 meters, turn, and return to
sitting in the chair [18]. Higher values of the PDQ-
39 indicate worse HRQL and higher TUG times
indicate slower performance, or worse functional
mobility.
Participants
In the first key analysis, participants who exer-
cised greater or equal to 2.5 hours per week were
classified as regular exercisers (E), and were hypoth-
esized to experience health benefits compared to
non-exercisers and low-exercisers [12]. The non- and
low-exercisers(identifiedasN)wereexpectedtohave
less benefit due to participation in less than 2.5 hours
of exercise per week. Over time, as people increased
or decreased their exercise over 2 years, or 3 vis-
its, we identified 8 groups: NNN, NNE, NEE, EEE,
ENN, EEN, ENE, NEN. Decreasing or stopping exer-
cise could be related to a choice to reduce exercise
due to change in motivation or available time, but
could also be due to a functional decline or illness
that was not related to exercise habits. To avoid con-
founding our interpretation of exercise habits with
potential illnesses we focused our first key analysis
onlyongroupsNNN,NNE,NEE,andEEE,whichare
defined in Table 1. Data for all 8 groups are reported
in Supplementary Table 1.
The second key analysis included all participants
with at least 3 recorded visits. Including all par-
ticipants allowed the analysis to account for both
increases and decreases in time spent exercising.
Statistical analyses
First, the longitudinal (3 visit) cohort of the NPF-
QII participants was compared to the cohort who
had less than 3 visits (two sample t-test, Wilcoxon
Rank Sum, Fisher’s exact test, and Pearsons chi-
square test as appropriate). Then in the first key
analysis, we compared our four groups of inter-
est: consistent regular exercisers, those starting to
exercise after the first or second visit, and consis-
tent non-exercisers. We present (1) absolute HRQL
and functional mobility, (2) risk-adjusted HRQL
and functional mobility values, and (3) risk-adjusted
change from baseline. The risk adjustment includes
the following baseline variables: age at diagnosis,
disease duration, sex, disease severity, and comor-
bidities. Comorbidities were categorized as 0, 1, or 2+
based on the participant’s response to having one of
the following conditions: heart problems, respiratory
problems, diabetes, cancer, arthritis, other neuro-
logic disorder, and other non-neurologic disorder.
Because age and disease duration had a non-linear
relationship with HRQL and functional mobility, they
were treated by coding each as splines with 2 inte-
rior knots (0.3, 0.6). Pairwise comparisons of mean
change from baseline at year two (3rd visit) were
performed using a 2 sided t-test with the presented
p-values adjusted for multiple comparisons using the
Holm method.
Our second key research question used multivari-
ate, mixed effects, linear regression to quantify the
changes in HRQL and functional mobility associ-
ated with increases and decreases in exercise over
time. Zero exercise was the reference point, and

the upper limit was 15 hours of exercise per week.
Exercise was recorded in hours per week using dec-
imals for time less than an hour. For the purpose
of this analysis, exercise was rescaled as a contin-
uous variable with increasing units of 30-minutes
(0.5 hrs), as 30 minutes is a clinically-relevant incre-
ment of exercise. Time spent exercising was treated
as a time-varying covariate to account for increases
or decreases in exercise over time. The time vari-
able was measured in years from first visit to account
for inter-individual variability in visit scheduling.
Two random effects were included in the models:
intercept to account for baseline inter-individual dif-
ferences, and linear slope of time to account for
inter-individual differences in progression. The same
risk adjustment methods used in the first analysis
were used (age at diagnosis, disease duration, sex,
disease severity, and comorbidities). A secondary
analysis compared the results between disease sever-
ity groups rather than controlling for disease severity.
This secondary analysis tested whether the impact
of exercise differed in people with moderate (HY
stage 3) and advanced PD (HY stage 4–5), com-
pared to the reference group of mild PD symptoms
(HY stage 1–2).
RESULTS
Participants
The current analyses included 3408 participants
who had data over 2 years, representing at least 3
clinic visits. The second visit occurred on average at
1.28 ± 0.49 years after the first visit and the third visit
occurred on average at 2.49 ± 0.67 years after the
first visit. Demographic and baseline disease charac-
teristics of the participants are presented in Table 2.
Our cohort represents 42% of the total 8041 NPF-
QII participants. Reasons for exclusion from this
analysis included the following: approximately 12%
of participants had not reached 2 years following
enrollment; 7% died prior to their third visit; 14%
withdrew from the study (moved away from Cen-
ter, changed site of PD care, PD is no longer the
diagnosis, or declined further participation in study).
At the time of this analysis, an additional 25% of
the original participants had not achieved 3 visits
for unknown reasons. The resulting analyses include
3,189 participants who completed the PDQ-39 and
3,062 participants who completed the TUG. More
participants in the advanced PD (HY 4–5) category

were missing TUG scores. The baseline demograph-
ics and measures of interest for the cohort of included
participants (n = 3,408) are compared to the excluded
cohort (n = 4,633) in Table 2. The participants who
were included in the analysis, having at least 3 vis-
its, tended to be younger, with earlier stage PD,
higher levels of exercise, better HRQL and functional
mobility compared to the participants with less than
3 visits.
Effects of exercising or starting to exercise
at least 2.5 hours per week
The absolute values of HRQL and functional
mobility for the 4 exercise groups are shown in
Fig. 1A and 1B. The consistent non-exercisers have
worse HRQL and worse functional mobility than
each of the other three groups at each visit. The
risk-adjusted HRQL and functional mobility mea-
sures presented in Fig. 1C and 1D demonstrate that
controlling for age, disease duration, sex, disease
severity, and comorbidities does not account for dif-
ferences between non-exercisers and exercisers at
baseline, although the three groups that began as non-
exercisers had similar functional mobility at baseline
(Fig. 1D). Because of initial differences between
groups, we completed our statistical analysis on the
risk-adjusted change from baseline (Fig. 1E and 1F).
Maintaining regular exercise at least 2.5 hour/week
(EEE) and becoming a regular exerciser after the
baseline visit (NEE) were associated with better
HRQL and functional mobility after 2 years com-
pared to consistent non-exercisers. Participants who
became regular exercisers later, after their second

non-exercisers.
Quantifying changes associated with 30-minute
exercise increments over time
Controlling for age, sex, disease duration, disease
severity, and comorbidities, non-exercisers worsened
by 1.37 points (SE 0.08) per year in the PDQ-39, and
worsened by 0.47 seconds (SE 0.03) in their TUG
time. Across all participants, a 30-minute increase in
exercise per week was associated with 0.16 point (SE
0.02) better PDQ-39 score per year and by 0.04 sec-
onds (SE 0.01) better TUG performance per year
(p < 0.0001 for all). The secondary analysis presented
in Table 3 compares participants with moderate (HY
2.5 – 3) and advanced PD (HY 4–5) to the ref-
erence group of mild PD (HY 1–2). This analysis
revealed that people with advanced PD had the largest
improvements in HRQL related to exercise (–0.41
points inclusive of reference group value, compared
to –0.14 points in mild PD; p = 0.02). For functional
mobility, the improvements were similar at all PD
stages.
DISCUSSION
The NPF-QII study is the largest prospective, lon-
gitudinal, observational study of people with PD
followed in the naturalistic setting. This is the first
analysis reporting longitudinal outcomes of exercise
habits over two years. The first key finding of this
analysis was that self-reported regular exercise habits
at least 2.5 hours per week, was associated with
significantly less decline in HRQL and functional
mobility over two years compared to people who did
not exercise regularly. Furthermore, participants who
started to achieve greater or equal to 2.5 hours per
weekaftertheirfirststudyvisitalsodemonstratedsig-
nificantly better HRQL and functional mobility after
two years compared to those who remained non- or
low-exercisers. These findings suggest that regular
exercise, even when started later in the course of PD,
may slow the decline in HRQL and functional mobil-
ity over the long-term in people with PD. However,
beginning regular exercise after the 2nd visit, did not
achieve statistically significant protection on HRQL
or functional mobility when measured approximately
one year later. Thus, the benefits of regular, but infor-
mal, independent exercise habits may require a longer
time to accrue than short-term, supervised, research-
based exercise participation [5–11].
The small, but statistically significant, benefit of
regular exercise habits on HRQL and functional
mobility was measured as a slower decline in PDQ-39
and TUG performance. In contrast, exercise trials can
result in improvements in HRQL and mobility in 6
weeks to 6 months [5, 7–9]. The exercise performed
in clinical trials is performed with greater supervi-
sion, structure, intensity, and external motivation than
self-reported exercise in the NPF-QII data [5–11],
which is likely to contribute to the greater gains.
Exercise trials frequently include 2-3 hours/week
[5, 6, 8, 9]. Some exercise trials only include par-
ticipants with low exercise behaviors prior to the
study to maximize measureable improvements [5, 6].
Although we cannot assume a causal relationship,
our results suggest that there are long-term bene-
fits to sustained regular exercise habits, even if it is
not in a formal, protocol-driven, supervised research

setting. In this observational study, the exercise self-
reported by the participants could include a variety
of exercise modalities and intensities over the course
of a week, as long as the participant defined it as
exercise time. Our observation of exercise benefits,
despite the self-reported and general nature of the
exercise recorded, supports the American Academy
of Neurology’s recommendation of regular exercise
counseling for people with PD [13].
The incremental benefit of increasing exercise by
30 minutes per week was also small but significant:
less than 1 point on the PDQ-39 and less than 0.1 sec-
onds for the TUG per year. A 1.6 point change on
the PDQ-39 over 6 months has been shown to be
the smallest clinically important difference in people
with PD [19] and the standard error of measure-
ment of PDQ-39 is approximately 4 points [20].
Although there is no established clinically impor-
tant difference for the TUG in people with PD, the
minimal detectable change (95% confidence inter-
val) values range from 3.5 to 11 seconds [21–23].
Based on these estimates of clinical responsiveness,
the benefits of adding 30 minutes regular exercise per
week would not be measurable on an individual level
after only one year. Increasing exercise by more than
30 minutes, or maintaining that increase in exercise
for greater than 2 years, are likely to be necessary
to measure individual differences over time. The
first analysis suggests that the risk-adjusted change
in PDQ-39 was approximately 1.6 points different
between the consistent exercisers and non-exercisers
(Fig. 1C), suggesting that 2.5 hours of exercise per
week over 2 years, rather than a 30 minute difference
over 1 year, reaches clinically meaningful thresholds.
Future experimental studies will need to establish
clinically meaningful frequency, intensity, and dura-
tion of informal exercise. The regression analysis
may be interpreted more clearly as the better natural
history of exercisers compared to the non-exercising
reference group.
An unexpected finding was that the HRQL ben-
efit associated with 30-minute increases in exercise
per week was greatest in people with advanced PD.
While the incremental difference was small this find-
ing has significant clinical and research implications
for the development of strategies to make exercise
and physical activity more accessible to people with
more severe disability. People with more advanced
PD may have poor access to regular exercise, as
their mobility impairments would limit their inde-
pendent participation in existing community and
group exercise programs. Community-based exercise
programs may also increase caregiver burden in peo-
ple with advanced PD, because they may rely on their
caregiver for transportation [24]. In addition, most
exercise intervention studies [5–9] and studies pre-
senting community-based exercise programs [10, 11]
target people with mild to moderate PD symptoms.
Thus, novel methods to encourage physical activity
and exercise in people with advanced PD, particu-
larly methods that account for caregiver concerns,
could provide a great benefit to the PD community.
The smaller improvements seen in HRQL in people
with mild PD may be due to lower level of impairment
and a possible floor effect on the PDQ-39 [17]. How-
ever, our average impairment of 0.19 ± 0.13 on the
PDQ-39 for people with mild PD (Table 2) indicates
that many of the participants still had some room for
improvement.
In contrast to HRQL, the association of exercise
with functional mobility was similar across all stages
of PD. Interpretation of consistency across all stages
could be limited in people with advanced PD, as peo-
ple who could not complete the TUG without using
their hands were not included in this analysis. Using
an alternate TUG analysis, the “TUG with penalty”
[25], that adds 6 seconds for the use of hands to push
up from the chair would include more participants,
but would be more difficult to interpret as its psy-
chometric properties have not yet been established.
As clinicians and researchers investigate the effect
of exercise in future studies with more advanced PD
participants, developing clinical responsiveness data
for the “TUG with penalty” may improve the inter-
pretation of this measure.
One limitation that impacts both analyses is that
the included participants with at least 3 visits repre-
sented only 42% of the entire NPF-QII study. These
participants were younger, more likely to be in the
early stages of PD during the first visit, they had
better HRQL and functional mobility at baseline,
and exercised more than the whole NPF-QII sam-
ple. Thus, these results may not generalize to all
people with PD nor to people who are not receiv-
ing treatment for their PD at expert care sites or
movement disorders neurology clinics. Future lon-
gitudinal analyses will benefit from longer duration
of follow up, inclusion of more participants, and
advanced statistical techniques including imputation
of missing data. These longer duration studies may
be able to measure changes in the trajectory of HRQL
and mobility when participants start exercising using
nonlinear regression analyses. A second limitation is
that we cannot assume a causal relationship between
 200
M.R. Rafferty et al. / Regular Exercise, Quality of Life, and Mobility in Parkinson’s Disease
exercise and better HRQL and functional mobility
over 2 years based on the results of this observational
study. A third limitation is that the NPF-QII data does
not include type or intensity of exercise performed.
Sincethisdatawasanalyzed,intensityofexercisewas
addedtotheNPF-QIIdatacollectionform,whichwill
provide more clinically relevant information about
how to prescribe regular exercise in future analyses.
A fourth limitation is that the self-reported exercise
measure could be prone to inaccuracies and reporting
bias. There have been great advances in body-worn
sensors to measure exercise since the NPF-QII study
was initiated in 2009. Sensors are likely to have bet-
ter reliability and responsiveness than self-reported
data, but questions remain about the most sensitive
devices and analysis algorithms to define activity
across the stages of the disease [26]. In the absence
of body-worn sensors, the substantial baseline differ-
ences between exercisers and non-exercisers suggest
that participants provide acceptable estimations of
their activity and ability [27, 28]. However, the base-
line differences remaining between exercisers and
non-exercisers after risk-adjustment indicates that
exercisers and non-exercisers have other fundamen-
tal differences that are not explained by age, disease
duration, disease severity, sex, and number of comor-
bidities. Some motor symptoms of PD are roughly
accounted for in our analysis by the disease sever-
ity metric. Other unmeasured differences between
exercisers and non-exercisers may include non-motor
symptoms of Parkinson’s disease and patient-centric
factors, such as depression, apathy, and self-efficacy.
In conclusion, beginning to exercise regularly after
baseline, or reporting consistent exercise over 2 years
were both associated with small but significant pro-
tective effects on HRQL and functional mobility
over two years. The greater benefit of exercise on
HRQLinadvancedPDsuggeststhatcliniciansshould
encourage, facilitate, and monitor long-term exercise
participation across all stages of PD. Although these
observational data only scratch the surface of what
could be measured for exercise, HRQL, mobility, and
potential confounding variables, these data are a valu-
able addition to existing research on regular exercise
habits in people with PD.
