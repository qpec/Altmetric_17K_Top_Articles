Infections with Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) are associated with cancer development, and EBV
lytic replication (the process that generates virus progeny) is a strong risk factor for some
cancer types. Here we report that EBV infection of B-lymphocytes (in vitro and in a mouse
model) leads to an increased rate of centrosome amplification, associated with chromosomal
instability. This effect can be reproduced with virus-like particles devoid of EBV DNA, but not
with defective virus-like particles that cannot infect host cells. Viral protein BNRF1 induces
centrosome amplification, and BNRF1-deficient viruses largely lose this property. These
findings identify a new mechanism by which EBV particles can induce chromosomal instability
without establishing a chronic infection, thereby conferring a risk for development of tumours
that do not necessarily carry the viral genome.

 T
he large majority of the world population is infected by the
Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) that establishes a lifelong
infection,
usually
without
clinical
consequences1.
However, EBV infection is etiologically associated with the
development of up to 2% of all human cancers2,3. EBV is
endowed with powerful transforming abilities that are promptly
revealed upon infection of B cells, its main target1. Three days
after infection, B cells initiate cell division and readily establish
permanently growing cell lines, termed lymphoblastoid cell lines
(LCLs)1. This phenomenon can also be observed in vivo, for
example, in infectious mononucleosis syndromes during which
EBV-infected B-cell blasts proliferate in the peripheral blood and
the lymph nodes of infected individuals4,5. These proliferating B
cells can also give rise to a tumour in immunocompromised
patients, in particular in transplant recipients who receive
immunosuppressive
drugs6.
EBV-mediated
transformation
requires the simultaneous expression of most latent proteins
that belong to the LMP1 and EBNA families. BHRF1, an
antiapoptotic viral homologue of the Bcl2 protein and EBV
microRNAs also markedly modulate this process1,7–10. However,
most tumours induced by the virus do not express all latent genes
and all EBV miRNAs1,11,12. Although proteins such as EBNA1,
LMP1 and LMP2 or the BART miRNAs have been shown to
contribute to the acquisition of the malignant phenotype in
EBV-associated nasopharyngeal and gastric carcinomas or in
Hodgkin’s
disease
and
Burkitt’s
lymphomas,
the
precise
contribution of the virus to the transformation process in these
cases remains unclear1.
Epidemiological studies have shown that lytic replication, the
process that generates new virus progeny in infected cells, is a risk
factor for cancer development. High antibody titres against viral
proteins that are expressed during virus lytic replication are
predictive of nasopharyngeal carcinoma13,14. Other environ-
mental risk factors for this tumour, such as the consumption of
nitrosamines or phorbol esters in food or smoking, have all been
shown to activate EBV lytic replication15–18.
In this paper, we show that EBV lytic replication has a marked
influence on the genetic stability of infected cells.
Results
EBV replication in B cells increases chromosomal instability.
We addressed the contribution of EBV lytic replication to the
neoplastic process induced by the virus by comparing B cells
infected with the highly replicating strain M81 that was isolated
from a nasopharyngeal carcinoma and a replication-deficient
mutant thereof (M81/DZR). We began our investigations by
comparing the mitoses of cells either stimulated with pokeweed
mitogen (PWM) or infected with either M81 or M81/DZR. At day
3 post treatment, dividing PWM-stimulated B cells displayed
typical mitotic figures at different stages, with equal distribution
of chromosomes in daughter cells (Supplementary Fig. 1a–c). In
contrast, many dividing cells infected with either type of virus
exhibited abnormal mitoses. Some mitoses were multipolar,
others were bipolar but arranged around multiple centrioles
(Figs 1a,b and 2a). Some mitoses contained non-aligned chro-
mosomes and some anaphases showed images of chromosome
lagging (Fig. 1c,d). We also found asymmetrical anaphases in
which the chromosome sets were imperfectly distributed (Fig. 1e).
Altogether, this set of experiments showed that 15 to 42% of
mitoses in infected cells displayed an abnormal organization,
which compares to 0 to 6% after PWM stimulation (Fig. 1j).
Moreover, 2.2 to 7% of interphase cells showed more than four
centrioles in the virus-infected population (Figs 1f and 2b).
Six days after infection, the cells with abnormal nuclei became
also visible. Some cells displayed two to four equally sized nuclei,
others carried one or several micronuclei coexisting with a
nucleus of approximately normal size (Figs 1g,h and 2c,d). Other
cells contained a single large nucleus that proved to be polyploid
after staining with serum from CREST patients that evidences the
number of centromeres (Fig. 1i). Giemsa staining of mitotic plates
showed that 25 to 40% of cells in these samples were aneuploid
and up to 3% were polyploid (Fig. 2e,f). We performed multiplex
fluorescence in situ hybridization (M-FISH) on three sample pairs
6 days after infection with M81 or M81/DZR (Supplementary
Fig. 2). This analysis confirmed the high level of aneuploidy in
cells infected with either type of viruses (average 29.2%), but also
the presence of rare cells with chromosome deletions (2/120) or
translocations (3/120). However, none of these abnormalities
were clonal, that is, found in more than two mitoses of the same
sample. At this time point, PWM-stimulated cells had died and
could not be analysed. We continued to monitor the cells infected
with M81 and M81/DZR until day 30 postinfection, when lytic
replication begins in cells infected with wild-type viruses. By then,
both centrosomal amplification and aneuploidy rates had been
reduced by approximately 3-fold in cells infected with M81/DZR,
implying that the conditions that led to their appearance vanished
over time (Fig. 2a,b,e). The investigation of cells infected with
M81/DZR at day 3, 6, 15 and 30 post infection showed a regular
decrease in the rate of centrosome amplification (Supplementary
Fig. 3). In contrast, although cells infected with the wild-type
virus showed an initial decrease in the percentage of cells showing
centrosome amplification, this rate sharply re-increased at day 30
when infected cells start to replicate (Fig. 2a,b, Supplementary
Fig. 3a,b).
M-FISH karyotyping of four sample pairs confirmed the much
higher level of aneuploidy in cells infected with the wild-type
virus than in those infected with the replication-deficient mutant
after 30 days of infection (average 38.75 versus 9%) (Fig. 3,
Supplementary Fig. 4). The former cells also more frequently
carried structural rearrangements, including chromosome dele-
tions and translocations. Two of these four samples infected with
wild type but none of those infected with M81/DZR showed a
clonal abnormality, defined by more than two identical abnormal
mitoses for structural abnormalities and more than three mitoses
for chromosome loss. One B-cell sample infected with wild-type
virus carried a recurrent t(6;9), the other showed a clonal loss of
the chromosome Y (Supplementary Fig. 4). We extended our
observations to cells infected with B95-8, a virus strain that hardly
induces lytic replication, and found that they exhibited a pattern
of chromosomal instability (CIN) and aneuploidy very similar to
the one induced by M81/DZR (Supplementary Figs. 1d–i, 3c,d
and 4b,d,h). We also analysed a cell line infected by B95-8 using
M-FISH 60 days after infection and found that it carried a
recurrent t(9;15) (Supplementary Fig. 4d,h).
EBV infection induces chromosomal instability in vivo. We
then injected resting primary B cells briefly exposed in vitro to
EBV into immunodeficient NSG mice. Although infection of
resting B cells with the wild-type or with replication-deficient
viruses gave rise to an identical rate of cell transformation and cell
growth rate in vitro, intraperitoneal injection of 4 � 104 B cells
infected with M81 wild type gave rise to tumour development
more frequently than infection with the replication-deficient
mutant (Fig. 4a–c). This difference in incidence disappeared after
the injection of ten times more (4 � 105) EBV-infected cells.
However, in that case, the tumour burden developed by the
animals was higher after infection with wild-type virus (Fig. 4d).
Immunohistochemical analysis of the tumour samples confirmed
that the tumour cells were infected by EBV, and that only cells
infected with the wild-type virus underwent lytic replication

 (Fig.
4e).
The
frequency
of
aneuploidy
and
centrosomal
abnormalities in these tumours was two to three times higher
after infection with wild-type viruses relative to the M81/
DZR mutant, and the absolute frequency of many of these
abnormalities was higher than those observed in vitro (compare
Figs 2 and 5).
EBV infection induces centrosome overduplication. Centro-
some amplification can result from a centrosome overduplication
during the S phase or from centrosome accumulation that takes
place after mitotic slippage, when dividing cells revert to the G1
phase without partitioning their chromosomes, thereby becoming
tetraploid and equipped with two centrosomes19. We investigated
both possibilities by staining cells with an increased number of
centrosomes with an antibody against the CEP170 protein that
associates with subdistal appendages of mother centrioles20
(Fig. 6a–d). Centriole overduplication gives rise to a higher
number of daughter centrioles than of mother centrioles, whereas
centriole accumulation gives rise to an equal number of mother
and daughter centrioles. We co-stained cells infected with
wild-type M81 with antibodies specific to CEP170 and to
centrin. This analysis revealed that more than two-thirds of
cells that displayed increased centriole numbers had undergone
centriole overduplication. This proportion fell to approximately
one-third in cells infected with M81/DZR, showing that, in these
cells, centrosome amplification more frequently results from
centrosome accumulation. We attempted to link the observed
centrosome overduplication with an alteration in the expression
level
of
proteins
involved
in
the
control
of
centrosome
duplication. However, cells infected by M81 or M81/DZR
expressed the Plk4 protein, a master regulator of centrosome
duplication21, at similar levels (Fig. 6e and Supplementary Fig. 5).
Similar results were obtained with immunoblots performed with
antibodies specific for SAS-6 and STIL, two other proteins
involved in centrosome replication.
Treatment with EBV particles induces CIN in dividing cells.
The results gathered so far showed that EBV lytic replication
increases aneuploidy and centrosome amplification. However, in
most infected cell populations, an average of 5% of the cells
undergo lytic replication22. This subpopulation cannot account
for the much higher aneuploidy and CIN rate observed in cells
infected with replicating viruses. However, cells undergoing virus
replication produce virions that bind to neighbour B cells in the

analysed eight sample pairs. The cells were analysed at day 3, 6 or 30 post infection. The cells were cytospinned and stained with multiple markers.
For each sample, at least 100 mitoses and 500 interphase cells were analysed. Independently, chromosomes were prepared to evaluate the rate of

 infected B cell population22. We tested whether these bound
particles could generate the genetic abnormalities observed in B
cells transformed with wild-type EBV by treating LCLs generated
with the M81/DZR mutant with virus-like particles (VLP) that are
devoid of viral DNA and cannot establish a chronic infection23,24.
The cells were exposed for 3 days to purified particles to exclude
contamination with soluble factors from the supernatant. We
tested VLPs derived from both B95-8 or from M81. This
treatment led to at least a doubling in the frequency of
centrosome amplification and aneuploidy, after either type of
VLP infection (Fig. 7a–c, Supplementary Fig. 6). Importantly, this
property was not shared by VLPs that are not able to fuse with
their targets because they are devoid of the gp110 protein that is
required for cell entry25. As we found no difference between VLPs
derived from either B95-8 or M81, we concentrated on M81
VLPs that can be produced at much higher levels. We added M81
VLPs to B cells expanded by the CD40L system in the presence of
IL4 and obtained very similar results in these EBV-negative cells
(Fig. 7d–f). We also treated PWM-stimulated B cells, RPE-1 and
HeLa cells with VLPs under the same conditions and also
observed an increase in the percentage of cells carrying abnormal
centrosome numbers (Fig. 7g–j, Supplementary Fig. 7a–h).

 Similar results were obtained with RPE-1 cells stably transfected
with a GFP-centrin-1 fusion protein (Supplementary Fig. 7i–m).
We infected the epithelial cell lines RPE-1 and HeLa with wild-
type M81 and stained them for expression of the EBV-specific
EBER noncoding RNAs (Supplementary Fig. 7n–q). This staining
showed that M81 infects between 1 and 1.5% of these cells. These
results suggest that EBV can interact with the cell division
machinery of cells lines without necessarily being able to establish
a chronic infection. M81 VLP treatment of RPE-1 cells also
doubled the rate of cells present in cytokinesis, suggesting that
this process is delayed by the treatment (Supplementary Fig. 7r).
We addressed this issue by exposing HeLa cells stably transfected
with mEGFP-a-tubulin and H2B-mCherry fusion proteins to
EBV VLPs and performed life cell imaging (Supplementary
Fig. 8). Although the average mitotic time was not influenced by
the treatment, cytokinesis took significantly longer in cells treated
with VLPs or wild-type virus (Supplementary Movies 1 and 2,
Supplementary Fig. 8).
BNRF1 induces centrosome overduplication and aneuploidy.
We then expressed any of 66 EBV proteins in the 293 cell line to
assess their contribution to CIN. We found that transfection of
BNRF1, a protein that strongly potentiates the efficiency of EBV
infection26, doubled the frequency of centriole amplification and
nearly tripled the frequency of multipolar mitoses, relative to
mock-transfected cells (Supplementary Fig. 9). Staining for
CEP170 revealed that transfection with BNRF1 did not increase
the frequency of cells carrying more than two CEP170-positive
centrioles, suggesting that this viral protein causes centriole
overduplication (Supplementary Fig. 9i). We monitored BNRF1
expression in primary B cells exposed to EBV. This protein was
clearly detectable in the infected B cells during the first 5 days
after infection (Supplementary Fig. 10). This observation suggests
that the levels of BNRF1 protein are not reduced by cell division
in the first days post infection and fits with the observation that
EBV-infected B cells do not initiate cell division before 3 days
after infection27. They also fit with the kinetic of centrosome
amplification that was visible at day 3 post infection, at which
time point BNRF1 is still available to infected cells. We then
repeated the aforementioned superinfection experiments with
wild-type B95-8 or with a defective B95-8 mutant that lacks
BNRF1 (ref. 26). Although exposure of LCLs generated with
the replication-deficient M81/DZR mutant to a recombinant
B95-8 EBV devoid of the BNRF1 gene (B95-8/DBNRF1) did
not increase centriole numbers in these cells (Fig. 8a–c), exposure
to
wild-type
viruses

to
B95-8/DBNRF1
viruses

complemented with a BNRF1 expression plasmid did. We also
infected primary B cells with BNRF1 knockout viruses derived
from either B95-8 or M81 wild-type viruses and found that the
growing cells showed a striking 5- to 10-fold reduction in the
average frequency of centriole amplification and multipolar
mitoses,
relative
to
cells
infected
with
wild-type
viruses
(Fig. 8d–f,h–j). Complementation of these defective BNRF1
knockout viruses with the BNRF1 protein to reconstitute a
wild-type virus restored the abnormalities. Similar, though less
pronounced, effects were visible on the rate of aneuploidy.

 DBNRF1 virus displayed a 2.5- to 3.5-time reduction in the
rate of aneuploidy relative to infection with wild-type or BNRF1-
complemented viruses (Fig. 8g,k).
The BNRF1 protein localizes to the centrosomal fractions. In
an attempt to gain some insights into the mechanisms that
underlie BNRF1’s ability to induce centrosome amplification, we
generated stable 293 cell lines that express BNRF1 under the
control
of
a
tetracyclin-responsive
promoter.
This
allows
immediate induction in more than 90% of the cells. After
exclusion of the nucleus, the cellular organelles were separated on
a sucrose gradient. Western blot with antibodies specific to g-
tubulin and centrin-2 allowed identification of the gradient
fractions that contained the centrosome (Fig. 9). Immunoblot
with a BNRF1-specific antibody revealed that BNRF1 is exclu-
sively located in the centrosome fractions. We also stained the
sequential
sucrose
fractions
with
antibodies
specific
to
nucleophosmine (NPM1) and to human poly (ADP-ribose)
polymerase 1 (PARP1). As previously described in the literature,
both proteins also sedimented in the centrosomal fractions28,29.
The expression levels of both cellular proteins was similar in the
presence or absence of BNRF1, although the shorter form of
PARP1 generated by caspase cleavage was overrepresented in cells
expressing the viral protein.
Discussion
Lytic replication has long been recognized as a major risk factor
for the development of EBV-positive nasopharyngeal carcinoma.
Moreover, cells that undergo EBV lytic replication also activate
cellular cancer-associated pathways30. However, herpesvirus lytic
replication typically leads to cell death, rendering the link
between
replicating
cells
and
cancer
development
not
obvious31,32. Our results remove these conceptual difficulties by
showing that the virions themselves conferred the risk induced by
lytic replication to non-replicating cells. The EBV particles

This property is substantially lost in a virus that lacks BNRF1 but

upon
reintroduction
of
the
protein

complementation. Furthermore, transfection of BNRF1 causes
centrosome overduplication, an abnormality that facilitates the
occurrence of multipolar mitoses and of bipolar mitoses with
clustered multiple centrosomes33. An increased number of
centrosomes is a strong risk factor for defective chromosome
attachment, in particular merotelic attachments that foster the
occurrence of chromosome lagging and non-aligned chromo-
somes33. Non-aligned chromosomes can lead to micronuclei
formation, an anomaly that we observed in EBV-infected cells

 and can foster extensive genomic rearrangements34,35. Lagging
chromosomes increase the average time of mitosis and facilitate
the development of aneuploidy or of chromosome deletion, for
example,
if
they
become
blocked
in
the
furrow
during
cytokinesis36. Together with non-aligned chromosomes, they
can also cause mitotic slippage that leads to polyploidy with cells
carrying either an enlarged nucleus or multiple nuclei33. Thus, an
aberrant
centrosome
multiplication
induced
by
BNRF1
could in principle explain all abnormalities identified shortly
after EBV infection and upon inception of lytic replication in
infected cells.
However, although deletion of BNRF1 in the virion markedly
reduced the aneuploidy rate, some residual aneuploidy persisted
in the infected cells. This could suggest that the influence of VLPs
on the mitotic machinery is not limited to BNRF1 and the
centrosome. In this line, we noticed cytokinesis defects in HeLa
cells exposed to EBV and multinucleated cells in EBV-infected
LCLs. However, the rate of aneuploidy in cells infected with the
BNRF1 knockout virus and in CD40L-stimulated cells was nearly
identical, thereby suggesting that B cells growing in culture for
several weeks always display a low level of aneuploidy, although
previous studies reported that non-B diploid cells passaged
in vitro display approximately 1% of mitoses with figures of
missegregation37. It is also important to note that studies with the
BNRF1 knockout virions were conducted with very large amounts
of viruses, as these viruses have a markedly reduced ability to
infect B cells26. These conditions might reveal the properties of
proteins other than BNRF1 present in EBV infectious particles
that usually do not or only minimally interfere with the mitotic
machinery.
We also noted that the rate of aneuploidy was higher than the
rate of centrosome accumulation in infected cells. This can be
partly explained by the methodology we used to unequivocally
identify cells with centrosome accumulation. Indeed, we counted
non-mitotic cells as abnormal only if they carry more than four
centrioles, as normal cells that went through centrosome
replication carry four centrioles. However, cells with three or
four centrioles could be abnormal cells that had not gone yet
through centrosome replication. Moreover, the identification of
mitoses organized around an abnormal number of centrioles is
only possible if these centrioles are well separated after staining
and it is not always the case. Thus, we most certainly
underestimated the frequency of centrosome aberrations. Finally,
it is theoretically possible that cells with centrosome amplification
give rise to daughter cells that received an abnormal number of
chromosomes but only one centrosome upon cell division.

Figure 9 | BNRF1 is enriched in the centrosomal fraction. A total 293 cells were subjected to BNRF1 overexpression. Cellular organelles were separated on
a sucrose gradient after exclusion of the nuclei. We immunostained the consecutive fractions collected from this gradient with an antibody specific for
g-tubulin to identify the centrosomal proteins and with an antibody specific to BNRF1. We also stained the extracts with antibodies specific to PARP1, a
protein that localizes to the centrosome. The antibody specific to PARP1 identifies a full size protein as well as a smaller form of the protein generated by
caspase 3 cleavage. Finally, we stained the blots with an antibody specific to Akt to detect contaminations from free cytoplasmic proteins. The latter
staining was performed to ensure that the gradient had not been contaminated with free cytoplasmic proteins. Non-purified whole-cell extracts (WCL)

 We observed translocations or chromosome deletions at a very
low rate and no clonal chromosomal abnormality shortly after
infection. In contrast, two out of four cell lines infected with wild-
type M81 carried a clonal abnormality (one clonal chromosome
loss and one clonal translocation) 6 weeks after infection, as did
the only LCL infected with B95-8 we investigated (one clonal
translocation). This suggests that the cell populations that carried
the clonal abnormality were selected out, presumably because
these genetic rearrangements confer a growth advantage. Thus,
even if translocation is a relatively rare event after EBV infection,
its effects can become dominant within the infected population.
Because the CIN induced by the initial contact with viral
particles from non-replicating strains subsides over time although
these cells continuously express the latent proteins, the effects of
EBV infection on the mitotic machinery are probably indepen-
dent of them1. However, it is very likely that the EBV latent
proteins modulate the effects of the virions on EBV-infected cells.
For example, EBNA3C has been shown to overcome the mitotic
checkpoint that should be activated in case of chromosomal
instability38. Furthermore, EBV latent genes have been found
to promote genomic instability and could amplify the effects
induced by the virions39–41.
The central role of the centrosome in organizing the mitotic
process explains its frequent deregulation in various types of
cancer, including those induced by the transforming papilloma-
virus strains42. The E7 protein expressed from the viral genome
in infected cells induces centrosome overduplication42. Although
not formally demonstrated for EBV, herpesviruses usually use
the cytoplasmic microtubule network and its organizer, the
centrosome, to reach the nucleus43,44. Therefore, herpes viral
particles will have an increased probability of interacting with the
centrosome. BNRF1 is a component of the tegument whose
absence impairs the transfer of the virus particle containing the
nucleocapsid from the endosome to the nucleus26. Migration of
the virus along the tubulin network would offer an opportunity of
interaction between BNRF1 and the centrosome. Alternatively,
we find that BNRF1 can localize to the centrosomal compartment
upon overexpression. It is therefore conceivable, although
currently entirely speculative, that BNRF1 brought into the cell
through infection but dissociated from the tegument during the
course of infection could reach the centrosome on its own.
The mechanisms that underlie the ability of BNRF1 to induce
centrosome accumulation remain unclear. We could not find any
differences in the expression levels of the centrosome-regulating
proteins STIL, SAS-6 or Plk4 between B cells infected by
replicating or non-replicating viruses. BNRF1 has been found to
bind to DAAX proteins in the nucleus45. DAXX can also
transiently co-localize to the centromere of chromosomes after
heat-shock treatment46. Immunoprecipitation experiments using
an antibody against BNRF1 coupled with protein sequencing
by mass spectrometry also identified NPM1 and PARP1, two
proteins present in the centrosome, as binding partners of BNRF1
(ref. 45). However, the interaction with these proteins, if real,
must be weak as their interactions with BNRF1 could not be
confirmed in subsequent experiments. We found that BNRF1
expression increases the production of the truncated PARP1 form
generated by caspase cleavage within the centrosome. Whether or
not the increase of this particular PARP1 form reflects the effects
of BNRF1 on the centrosome is currently unclear.
We show that replication-competent viruses induce tumours in
immuno-compromized mice with a higher frequency than
replication-defective ones. Furthermore, tumours induced by
wild-type viruses displayed stronger CIN and aneuploidy rates.
This suggests that wild-type viruses are more transforming in vivo
because they induce more CIN and aneuploidy. However, this
effect was not visible in vitro. The impact of centrosome
overduplication in tumorigenesis is difficult to evaluate in
experimental models and some authors have previously suggested
that it can only be revealed under in vivo conditions47. Our
observations are concordant with similar experiments previously
performed in humanized mice that showed that the wild-type
B95-8 strain is more transforming than a mutant thereof that
lacks the Z transactivator, although macroscopic tumours rarely
develop in these animals48. Moreover, humanized mice have an
immune system that interferes with infected cells. As B95-8
induces a very limited and abortive lytic replication, it is unlikely
that the effects observed in this work are due to the production
of virions.
The present
work largely explains the high
degree
of
aneuploidy that was previously reported in B cells infected
in vitro49 or in infected cells from healthy individuals propagated
in immunocompromised mice50, as well as in several types
of
EBV-induced
lymphomas51,52
and
carcinomas53–55.
In
particular, PTLD frequently show signs of lytic replication and
aneuploidy, and aneuploid tumours have a poorer response to
treatment51,56–58.
Our work suggests that every EBV infection, including a
primary infection, increases the risk of CIN and aneuploidy, a risk
factor for cancer development and that this risk will increase
proportionally to the frequency of contact with EBV virions.
Thus, patients infected with viruses that strongly replicate
or whose immune system cannot control virus multiplication
such as patients with immunodeficiencies are likely to be at
higher risk56,59. Our observations also have consequences for
vaccination strategies as VLPs have previously been proposed as
vaccines23,24,60. Deletion of BNRF1 from these viruses, or keeping
the virus from reaching the centrosome, should circumvent this
potential problem.
We also found that the effects of EBV virions extend to EBV-
negative cells. Because the virus does not have to induce a stable
infection to exert its effects on the centrosome, the range of cell
lineages in which the virus could increase the risk of CIN could
theoretically extend beyond the classical EBV targets. Thus, EBV
could be a risk factor for tumour development without being
present in the resulting tumour. It is interesting to note that
individuals who underwent an episode of infectious mononu-
cleosis after primary EBV infection are not only at increased risk
of EBV-associated Hodgkin
´s disease, but also of non-Hodgkin
lymphomas during the first year after infection61–63. The latter
tumours carry the EBV genome only in 5% of the cases64.
It would be important to perform epidemiological studies that
correlate clinical and biological markers of EBV lytic replication
with general cancer risk.

CD19-positive primary B-lymphocytes were isolated using M-450 CD19 (Pan B)
Dynabeads (Dynal) and were detached using Detachabead (Dynal). WI38 are
primary human lung embryonic fibroblasts (ATCC: CCL-75). All the cells were
routinely cultured in RPMI-1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum (FBS)(Biochrom), and primary B cells were supplemented with
20% FBS until the establishment of LCLs. HeLa Kyoto mEGFP-a-tubulin/H2B-
mCherry cells were supplemented with 0.5 mg ml � 1 puromycin and 500 mg ml � 1
G418. The EBV producer cells used in this study (M81, M81/DZR, B95-8, B95-8/
DBNRF1, B95-8/DBFLF1DBFRF1DBBRF1DBALF4 (VLP with gp110 deletion),
B95-8/DBFLF1DBFRF1DBBRF1 (VLP)) have previously been described and were
established by stable transfection of EBV-BACs into 293 cells supplemented with
100 mg ml � 1 hygromycin8,22,24,26. The VLP-producing mutants and the DBNRF1
mutant are also available on the basis of the M81 strain. They were constructed
exactly as their B95-8 homologues. M81/DZR lacks the BZLF1 and BRLF1
transactivators that initiate lytic replication and therefore it is unable to
replicate, B95-8/DBNRF1 and M81/DBNRF1 lack the BNRF1 tegument protein.
Plasmids. The BZLF1 (p509), BALF4 (pRA) and BNRF1 (B056) expression
plasmids were previously described26. We screened a library of 66 EBV proteins
driven from a CMV promoter67. An expression plasmid that encodes a
cytoplasmic-truncated version of rat CD2 (B673) was constructed in pcDNA3.1.
We also cloned the BNRF1 gene into a tetracycline-inducible plasmid, containing a
minimal CMV promoter controlled by TetO operator, a tetracycline transactivator
protein (Tet-On) driven by CAG promoter, the origin of plasmid replication
derived from B95-8 strain, and a puromycin resistance cassette driven by a
SV40 promoter (B1439)68. The parental vector without insert served as a negative
control.
Transfections. All the transfection experiments were performed with the lipo-
some-based transfectant Metafectene (Biontex) following the manufacturer’s
instruction.
Virus production. The 293 cells stably transfected with recombinant EBV-BACs
were transfected with expression plasmids encoding BZLF1 (p509) and BALF4
(pRA) to induce lytic replication, except for the production of VLPs that lack gp110
in which case only the BZLF1-encoding plasmid was transfected. Transfection of a
plasmid that encodes the BNRF1 protein (B056) in a producer cell line that stably
carries the DBNRF1 virus led to trans-complementation as described previously26.
Three days after transfection, virus supernatants were collected and filtered
through a 0.4 mm filter.
B-cell stimulation with mitogens or CD40-ligand. Freshly isolated CD19 þ
primary B cells were cultured with 15 mg ml � 1 of PWM (L9379, Sigma-Aldrich) or
cultured on a 90 Gy-g-irradiated CD40-ligand feeder cell layer in the presence of
25 ng ml � 1 recombinant human IL4 (PeproTech, Germany). The cells were
subjected to cytospins or chromosomal analyses 3 days after the inception of
stimulation.
Giemsa staining. The cells were treated with 0.075 mg ml � 1 colchicine (Sigma-
Aldrich C3915) for 2 h to induce metaphase arrest and allow the preparation of
metaphase spreads. After three washings with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), the
cells were incubated in 75 mM KCl hypotonic buffer for 10 min at 37 �C and fixed
in methanol: glacial acetic acid (3:1), dropped onto cold glass slides and stained
with 5% Giemsa (Carl Roth GmbH T862.1) in water. Digital images of metaphase
were captured using DM2500 (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) microscope equipped
with a DFC300 FX (Leica, Cambridge, UK) camera and subjected to karyotyping.
We analysed a minimum of 50 mitoses per sample. The investigator was blinded to
the group allocation. The experiments were performed single blinded. Fifteen
samples were independently analysed in parallel by Giemsa staining and 24-colour
chromosomal painting and yielded very similar results (see below).
Multiplex fluorescence in situ hybridization. M-FISH was performed as
previously described69. Briefly, seven pools of flow-sorted human whole
chromosome painting probes were amplified and directly labelled with seven
different fluorochromes (DEAC, FITC, Cy3, Cy3.5, Cy5, Cy5.5 and Cy7) using
degenerated oligonucleotides and PCR (DOP-PCR). Metaphase chromosomes
immobilized on glass slides were denatured in 70% formamide/2xSSC pH 7.0 at
72 �C for 2 min followed by dehydration in increasingly pure ethanol series. The
hybridization mixture contained combinatorially labelled painting probes, an
excess of unlabelled cot1 DNA, 50% formamide, 2xSSC and 15% dextran sulfate. It
was denatured for 7 min at 75 �C, pre-annealed at 37 �C for 20 min and hybridized
at 37 �C to the denaturated metaphase preparations. After 48 h, the slides were
washed in 2xSSC at room temperature three times for 5 min, followed by two
washes in 0.2xSSC/0.2% Tween-20 at 56 �C for 7 min each. Metaphase spreads
were counterstained with 4.6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and covered
with antifade solution. Metaphase spreads were recorded using a DM RXA
epifluorescence microscope (Leica Microsystems, Bensheim, Germany) equipped
with a Sensys CCD camera (Photometrics, Tucson, AZ, USA). Camera and
microscope are controlled by the Leica Q-FISH software and the images were
processed on the basis of the Leica MCK software and presented as multicolor
karyograms (Leica Microsystems Imaging solutions, Cambridge, UK). We analysed
between 15 and 20 metaphases for each sample.
Analysis of the mitotic spindle. The cells were washed three times and re-
suspended in PBS-3% FBS. The single cell suspension was then loaded on to
Shandon cytospin chambers with slides (Thermo Scientifics) and spun at
2,000 r.p.m. for 10 min. The cytospinned cells were air-dried, fixed in pure
methanol at � 20 �C for 8 min and briefly washed in PBS two times at room
temperature for 5 min each. The cells were blocked in PBS-3% bovine serum
albumin (BSA) for 30 min, incubated with the first antibody for 1.5 h, washed in
PBS three times for 5 min, incubated with a secondary antibody conjugated to Cy-
3, Cy-5 or Alexa488 for 1.5 h. The slides were again washed three times in PBS and
mounted in ProLong Gold antifade reagent including the DAPI fluorochrome (Life
Technologies). In each sample, at least 100 mitoses and 500 interphase cells were
examined. The investigator was single blinded for the analysis of the samples.
Pictures of stained cells were taken with a camera attached to a DM2500
fluorescence microscope (Leica) or with a confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM700 run
on ZEN2009).
Cell cycle synchronization. HeLa Kyoto mEGFP-a-tubulin/H2B-mCherry cells
(or other cells applied in the study) were treated with 2 mM thymidine for 16 h,
released for 8 h and again blocked for 16 h to obtain a double thymidine block.
Life cell imaging. We performed life cell imaging on HeLa Kyoto mEGFP-a-
tubulin/ H2B-mCherry cells that were treated for 72 h with medium, viruses or
virus-like particles. During this treatment, the cells were synchronized in the G1
phase by a double thymidine block. After the second release of the thymidine block,
2.5 � 105 cells per well were seeded in Ibidi m-slide eight-well plate or Lab-Tek II
chambered coverglass (eight chambers). The cells were monitored by a � 20/0.4 air
objective on an inverted microscope (Zeiss motorized Observer.Z1) connected to a
colour CCD camera AxioCam ICc 3 at 5% CO2 and 37 �C incubator. LED module
Colibri.2 with 470 nm for GFP and 590 nm for mCherry were used for fluor-
ochrome excitation. Multipoint images were taken with 3–8 z-stacks to cover a
range of 6 to 8 mm every 5 min for 5–15 h with the cell Zeiss Zen blue software.
Maximum intensity projection of the fluorescent channels was performed by
ImageJ software to create 8-bit RGB TIFF files and movies.
B-cell infections and in vitro transformation experiments. B cells purified from
peripheral blood of different healthy donors were exposed to viruses for 2 h at a
multiplicity of infection of 20 virus genomes, as defined by qPCR per target cell as
described previously26. The infected cells were washed once with PBS and plated in
cluster plates in RPMI supplemented with 20% FBS. For transformation assays, we
first determined the percentage of EBNA2-positive cells within the infected sample
using immunostaining 3 days post infection (d.p.i.). Infected cell populations were
seeded in 96-U-well plates coated with 103 g-irradiated WI38 feeder cells at a
concentration of 3 or 30 EBNA2-positive cells per well. Non-infected B cells served
as a negative control. The outgrowth of lymphoblastoid cell clones (LCLs) was
monitored at 30 d.p.i. In parallel, we also monitored cell growth in batch culture
by counting the cell numbers in the infected populations twice per week.
Screening of the EBV library. The EBV protein expression library67 was used
for transient transfection into 293 cells. To identify the transfected cells, we
co-transfected a plasmid encoding a cytoplasmic-truncated rat CD2 that is
expressed as a surface marker.
Transformation experiments in immunocompromised mice. We isolated
human CD19 þ B cells from buffy coats and exposed them to M81 or M81/DZR
in vitro for 2 h at room temperature under constant agitation at a multiplicity of
infection sufficient to generate 20% of EBNA2-positive cells8. We purchased the
NSG mouse strain (NOD.Cg-PrkdcscidIl2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ; NSG) from the Jackson
Laboratory that established it. This strain is currently maintained in the animal
facility of the German Cancer Research Center. The pre-established inclusion
criteria in this study were healthy male NSG mice aged between 6 and 10 weeks, the
exclusion criteria were death unrelated to the virus infection. The infected cells
were collected by centrifugation and washed twice with PBS. A total 2 � 105 or
2 � 106 primary B cells exposed to the virus, equivalent to 4 � 104 and 4 � 105
EBV-infected cells, respectively, were injected intraperitoneally into NSG mice that
were of similar age and were randomly grouped in different mouse cages. We used
three different buffy coats to infect 26 mice with 4 � 104 EBV-infected cells and five
different buffy coats to infect 32 mice with 4 � 105 EBV-infected cells. These

 numbers ensured adequate power to detect pre-effect size. The mice were killed at
6 weeks post injection when clinical symptoms appeared (apathy, food refusal,
ruffled hair, weight loss, palpable tumour). After careful autopsy, the organs were
subjected to macroscopic and microscopic investigation, including haematoxylin
and eosin staining and immunohistochemistry. We also generated single cell
suspensions from the tumour mass that were cultured overnight in RPMI-20%
FBS and used to generate metaphase spreads or cytospinned and subjected to
immunofluorescence staining. In all of these experiments, the investigator
was single blinded for the investigation of the mice and of the mice samples.
Immunohistochemistry. Organs from the killed mice were fixed in 10% formalin
and embedded in paraffin. Three micrometre thin sections were prepared and
immunostained after antigen retrieval (10 mM sodium citrate, 0.05% Tween 20, pH
6.0; 98 �C for 40 min). Bound antibodies were visualized with the Envision þ Dual
link system-HRP (Dako). Pictures were taken with a camera attached to a light
microscope (Axioplan, Zeiss).
Western blots. Proteins were extracted with a standard lysis buffer (150 mM
NaCl, 0.5% NP-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 5 mM EDTA, 20 mM
Tris-HCl pH 7.5, proteinase inhibitor cocktail (Roche)) for 15 min on ice followed
by sonication to shear the genomic DNA. Up to 20 mg of proteins denatured in
Laemmli buffer for 5 min at 95 �C were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and
electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond C, Amersham). After pre-
incubation of the blot in 3% BSA PBST (PBS with 0.2% Tween 20), the antibody
against the target protein was added and incubated at room temperature for 1 h.
After extensive washings in PBST, the blot was incubated for 1 h with secondary
antibodies. Bound antibodies were revealed using the ECL detection reagent
(Pierce). Uncropped scans of all immunoblots are shown in Supplementary
Figs 11 and 12.
Antibodies. We used primary mouse monoclonal antibodies against a-tubulin
(Sigma-Aldrich T5168 1:4,000 for immunostains), g-tubulin (Sigma-Aldrich T6557
1:5,000 for immunoblots), Plk1 (Santa Cruz sc-17783 1:200 for immunostains),
SAS-6 (Santa Cruz sc-81431 1:500 for immunoblots), centrin-1 (Millipore 04-1624
1:100 for immunostains), NPM1 (Zymed 32-5200 1:1,000 for immunoblots),
beta actin (Dianova DLN-07273 1:10,000 for immunoblots); rabbit polyclonal
antibodies against centrin-2 (Santa Cruz sc-27793-R 1:100 for immunostains and
1:1,000 for immunoblots), CEP170 (Abcam ab72505 1:500 for immunostains),
phospho-Histone H3 (PH3, Cell Signaling 9716 1:100 for immunostains), STIL
(Bethyl Laboratories A302-442A 1:500 for immunoblots), PARP1 (Cell Signaling
9542S 1:1,000 for immunoblots), Akt (Cell Signaling 1:1,000 for immunoblots);
human polyclonal anti centromere (CREST, Antibodies Incorporated 15-235-F 1:5
for immunostains). The mouse monoclonal antibodies against BZLF1 (clone BZ.1
1:1,000 for immunoblots and 1:100 for immunohistochemistry), gp350 (clone OT6
1:1,000 for immunoblots and 1:100 for immunohistochemistry), rat CD2 (clone
OX34 1:100 for immunostains) were collected from hybridoma supernatants.
Rabbit antiserum against BNRF1 protein (1:10,000 for immunoblots) was produced
as described before26. The mouse antibody against human Plk4 (0.2 mg ml � 1 for
immunoblots) was raised against a synthetic peptide (amino acid 567–579 of
human Plk4)70. The secondary antibodies applied for immunofluorescence staining
were goat anti-mouse coupled to Alexa488 (Invitrogen A11029 1:300) or Cy3
(Dianova 115-165-146 1:300), anti-rabbit coupled to Alexa488 (Invitrogen A11008
1:300) or Cy3 (Dianova 111-165-144 1:300). Horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat
anti-mouse or rabbit antibodies (Promega) were applied as secondary antibodies
for western blot analyses (dilution 1:10,000).
Centrosome isolation. The 293 cells were stably transfected with the tetracycline-
inducible plasmid carrying BNRF1 (B1439) or its control (B484) using puromycin
selection (2 mg ml � 1). Single-cell colonies that displayed an induction rate of at
least 90% were selected for further experiments. These cells were induced with
0.025 mg ml � 1 doxycycline for 1.5 days, then treated with nocodazole (10 mg ml � 1;
Merck Millipore) and cytochalasin B (5 mg ml � 1; Merck Millipore) for 90 min. The
cells were re-suspended in ice-cold PBS and the pellets were collected by cen-
trifugation. After washing with 0.1 � PBS, 8% sucrose, the pellets were lysed by
adding 8 ml of lysis buffer (1 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mM
MgCl2, 0.1% b-mercaptoethanol, 1X proteinase inhibitor cocktail (Roche)) per
15 cm plate, inverted several times and put on ice for 5 min. The lysates were spun
at 2,500g for 10 min at 4 �C to pellet down the nuclei, aggregates and intact cells.
The clarified supernatants were carefully collected and further filtered through
40 mm cell strainers. The lysates were adjusted to 1X PE (10 mM Pipes, 1 mM
ETDA) by using 50X PE buffer (500 mM Pipes, 50 mM ETDA, pH 7.2), incubated
with 1 mg ml � 1 DNaseI on ice for 15 min, loaded onto a 50% (weight/weight)
sucrose cushion prepared in gradient buffer (1X PE buffer, 0.1% Nonidet P-40,
0.1% b-mercaptoethanol), spun at 4 �C for 20 min at 12,000 r.p.m. with a SW40Ti
rotor without break. After centrifugation, 7 ml of supernatant were visible atop of
the cushion. We discarded the first 5 ml of supernatant and collected the remaining
2 ml, together with first the millilitre of sucrose gradient. These combined fractions
were well mixed and loaded onto a discontinuous sucrose gradient made from
bottom to top of 1 ml 70% (weight/weight) sucrose, 1.5 ml 50% (weight/weight)
sucrose, 2.5 ml 40% (weight/weight) sucrose prepared in gradient buffer. The
gradients were spun at 34,000 r.p.m. at 4 �C for 90 min with a SW40Ti rotor
without break. After centrifugation, the upper supernatant atop of the sucrose
gradient was discarded and the sucrose fractions were collected in 450 ml aliquots
from the bottom to the top. The organelles present in each fraction were recovered
by mixing 100 ml of each fraction with 1.2 ml 1X PE buffer and centrifuging them at
21,000g at 4 �C for 25 min. The supernatants from each these preparations were
carefully removed, the pellets were lysed using SDS sample buffer and subjected to
SDS page and western blot analyses.
Statistical analysis. All the experiments were planned with a biostatistician
(A.K.S.). Power calculations were performed for pairwise comparisons of inde-
pendent groups of quantitative (normally distributed) data. The effect size of
interest in this situation was prespecified to attain or exceed 2 (relevant difference/
standard deviation). For an effect size of 2, using group sizes of n ¼ 5 guarantees
the power for a hypothesis test at the 5% significance level of 79.1%, for n ¼ 8
power increases to 96% and reaches 99.7% for n ¼ 12. The compared groups had a
size larger than 12 in animal experiments or in experiments involving cells that
grew in vivo, and more than 5 in the large majority of in vitro experiments. In all
the compared groups, the standard deviation is shown as an error bar in the
plot. This serves as an estimate of variation. In all the groups, the distribution
was normal and the variance was similar in the compared groups.
We applied paired Student’s t-tests to the data collected from the infection of
multiple primary B cell samples or of LCLs established from the same blood sample
with two different types of viruses. The results collected from independent
infection experiments of the same cell lines with two different viruses were analysed
with a paired Student’s t-test. We used a mixed-linear model with random effect
for donor to globally analyse the effects of exposure to different viruses or of
mock-infection, and used Bonferroni-adjustment for pairwise comparisons. The
calculations were performed with SAS 9.3. Infection experiments that included
negative results were analysed with a Wilcoxon signed-rank test with calculations
performed with R. The results of the animal experiments in which multiple B-cell
populations were used for infections were evaluated with an exact Mantel–
Haenszel test with strata and the calculations performed with R. The data gathered
by life cell imaging over time were, as expected, right-skewed and were log-
transformed. They were then subjected to an analysis of variance test performed
on SAS 9.3, followed by Bonferroni-adjusted pairwise comparisons.
