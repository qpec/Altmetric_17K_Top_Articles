Abstract
Objective. Evaluate the human abuse potential,
pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and safety
of NKTR-181, a novel mu-opioid agonist molecule,
relative to oxycodone.
Design. This randomized, single-center, double-
blind, active- and placebo-controlled five-period
crossover study enrolled healthy, adult, non–physi-
cally dependent recreational opioid users.
Setting. Inpatient clinical research site.
Subjects. Forty-two randomized subjects (73.8%
male, 81% white, mean age 5 25 years).
Methods. The primary objective was to evaluate single
orally administered 100, 200, and 400mg NKTR-181
doses in solution compared with 40mg oxycodone
and placebo solutions using the Drug Liking visual an-
alog scale. Secondary measures included the Drug
Effects
Questionnaire,

Again
Assessment. Central nervous system mu-opioid effects
were assessed using pupillometry. The study included
qualifying and treatment phases. Subjects received
each of the five treatments using a crossover design.
Results. NKTR-181 at all dose levels had significantly
lower Drug Liking Emax than oxycodone (P< 0.0001).
Drug Liking scores for oxycodone increased rapidly
within 15minutes and peaked at approximately one
hour postdose, whereas Drug Liking (and most sec-
ondary abuse potential measures) for all doses of
NKTR-181 were comparable with placebo for at least
the first hour. Only the 400mg Drug Liking scores were
minimally differentiated vs placebo from one and a half
to four hours, but remained significantly lower than
oxycodone (P< 0.003). NKTR-181 treatment-related ad-
verse effects were mild and occurred at a lower rate
compared with oxycodone.
Conclusions. NKTR-181 demonstrated delayed on-
set of CNS effects and significantly lower abuse

Introduction
Opioid analgesics have a long history of use as a treat-
ment
for
moderate
to
severe
chronic
pain
[1].
Unfortunately, abuse of these medicines has become a
growing epidemic. In the United States, it is estimated
that between the years 2002 and 2011, 25 million peo-
ple used pain relievers for nonmedical, recreational use,
and in 2014, nearly 2 million people were addicted to or
abused these drugs [2,3]. Deaths from overdoses in-
volving prescription opioids have almost quadrupled in
the last 15 years, with nearly 19,000 such deaths re-
ported in the United States in 2014 alone [4].
Although rate of brain entry is not the sole determinant
of abuse potential, it is understood that rapid entry into
the central nervous system (CNS) is an important factor
in the overall attractiveness of a drug as a target for
abuse [5–8]. Volkow et al., using positron emission to-
mography (PET) studies in humans, demonstrated a link
between rapid brain uptake (leading to rapid striatal do-
pamine changes) of drugs subject to abuse and in-
creased reinforcing effects [9]. Self-reported feelings of
“high” increased in proportion to rapid increases of stria-
tal dopamine in subjects receiving intravenous methyl-
phenidate
but
were
essentially
absent
after
slow
increases of striatal dopamine following methylphenidate
oral administration [10]. These PET studies provide a
mechanistic basis for understanding widespread obser-
vations that drug abusers seek drugs such as heroin,
fentanyl, or oxycodone that have rapid CNS uptake re-
lated to their intrinsic physicochemical properties and
routes of administration. Rapid onset of CNS effects
can also contribute to respiratory depression, sedation,
intoxication, or other potentially dangerous and undesir-
able effects, increasing the risk of overdose and death
[11,12]. Therefore, it is our hypothesis that drugs with
inherently slow CNS uptake could have less abuse po-
tential and improved safety.
There is a need for safer medications that provide de-
sired analgesic benefits while reducing the potential for
abuse and tampering [8,13,14]. NKTR-181 is being de-
veloped to meet these needs. Specifically, NKTR-181’s
molecular structure was engineered with the goal of
providing
analgesia
comparable
with
morphine
and
other prototypic mu-opioid analgesics, but with lower
abuse potential and decreased incidence and severity
of adverse effects. The unique physicochemical proper-
ties of NKTR-181 result in a relatively slow rate of entry
into the CNS, independent of dose level or route of ad-
ministration. Despite the reduced rate of CNS entry,
NKTR-181 displays full analgesic activity comparable
with morphine and oxycodone in mouse and rat pain
models, while demonstrating reduced locomotor impair-
ment in the rotarod test [15]. Moreover, NKTR-181 has
a reduced abuse potential compared with oxycodone in
rats and monkeys, measured by self-administration and
progressive ratio breakpoint methods, where response
to NKTR-181 is similar to that of saline. In other preclini-
cal models, NKTR-181 has reduced CNS-mediated ad-
verse
effects
such
as
sedation
and
respiratory
depression when compared with oxycodone and mor-
phine [15–21].
In phase I studies in opioid-naı
¨ve healthy subjects,
NKTR-181 was safe and well tolerated as single doses
of 1,000 mg or less and as multiple doses up to 400 mg
twice daily for 14 days [22,23]. NKTR-181 exhibits a de-
layed and prolonged plasma pharmacokinetic profile
compared with prototypic mu-opioids such as oxyco-
done and morphine, with Cmax occurring approximately
three hours postdose and an elimination half-life of ap-
proximately 12 hours independent of dose, even when
administered as a solution (Figure 1) [15,22–25]. The
prolonged
exposure
profile
of
NKTR-181
supports
twice-daily dosing for the treatment of chronic pain,
without the need for a controlled release formulation,
and most likely contributes to the slow rate of CNS en-
try when compared with the rapid absorption of proto-
typic opioids.
Figure 1 displays the onset and duration of pupil con-
striction relative to plasma concentration time profiles af-
ter administration of oxycodone [25] or NKTR-181 to
healthy subjects [24]. The time course of miosis, a direct
measure of CNS mu-opioid effects, significantly lags the
time course of NKTR-181 in plasma, whereas these
time courses are essentially superimposable for oxyco-
done. The approximately three-hour lag in achieving
maximal miosis reflects slow entry of NKTR-181 into the
CNS from the plasma. The half-life of the blood-to-CNS
equilibration process, estimated using plasma drug con-
centration vs time and pupil diameter vs time data, for
NKTR-181 (2.9 hours) is 16 times longer than the re-
ported equilibration half-life for oxycodone (0.18 hour)
[15,24,25]. Slow CNS entry is a property inherent in the
molecular design of the NKTR-181 that is independent of
formulation, dose level, and route of administration.
These promising preclinical and clinical findings sup-
ported the granting of fast-track development status for
NKTR-181 by the US Food and Drug Administration [26].
This study evaluated the pharmacodynamics and abuse
potential, pharmacokinetics, and safety of NKTR-181
doses used in ongoing phase III trials, relative to oxyco-
done and placebo.

as
outlined
by
the
International Conference on Harmonisation. The study
was approved by the New England Institutional Review
Board, and the trial was conducted in compliance with
good
clinical
practice
and
applicable
regulatory
requirements.
Subjects
The study enrolled eligible healthy male and female
adults (age 18–55 years, inclusive) who reported recrea-
tional (i.e., nonmedical) opioid use at least 10 times in
the preceding year and at least once within the 12
weeks before screening. Subjects were not physically
dependent on opioids, as determined by interview and
naloxone challenge. Subjects were also in good health,
as indicated by medical history and physical exam, and
able to speak, read, and understand English. Voluntary
consent was obtained from all subjects before partici-
pating in the study. Key exclusion criteria included: 1)
pregnancy or lactation; 2) history or current diagnosis of
substance dependence (except nicotine and caffeine) or
alcohol abuse (based on DSM-IV-TR criteria; corre-
sponding to current nomenclature from DSM-V, “use
disorder”); 3) oxygen saturation value of less than 90%
or other clinically significant health problems at screen-
ing; and 4) consumption of any substance that inter-
fered with the trial as defined by the protocol.
Overall Study Design
This was a single-center, randomized, double-blind, ac-
tive- and placebo-controlled, five-period crossover study
that assessed the abuse potential, pharmacodynamics,
pharmacokinetics, and safety of NKTR-181 compared
with oxycodone and placebo, consistent with principles
provided in the 2010 US Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) draft guidance for Assessment of Abuse Potential
of Drugs [27]. Single doses of 100, 200, or 400 mg
NKTR-181 in solution were compared with single doses
of 40 mg oxycodone and placebo in solution. The study
consisted of a screening phase, a qualification phase, a
treatment phase, and a follow-up phase.
After initial screening, subjects entered into the qualifica-
tion phase, which consisted of a naloxone challenge
and oxycodone discrimination testing. The naloxone
challenge determined if subjects were physically opioid
dependent. After an initial dose of 0.2 mg naloxone was
administered by intravenous bolus, subjects were ob-
served for signs or symptoms of withdrawal as defined
by a Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS) score
of 5 or higher. If no evidence of withdrawal occurred
within 30 seconds, an additional dose of 0.6 mg nalox-
one was administered and subjects received an addi-
tional assessment using COWS. Subjects with COWS
scores of less than 5 after the naloxone challenge were
defined as not physically opioid dependent and re-
mained as inpatients in the clinical unit to complete the
Drug Discrimination Test. In a two-way crossover, 1:1

24 hours apart and after a minimum eight-hour fast.
Subjects were eligible to enter the treatment phase if
they tolerated oxycodone and demonstrated the follow-
ing within the first two hours after dosing: 1) a placebo
response
between 40
and
60 mm,
maximum
effect
(Emax) of 65 mm or greater in response to oxycodone
treatment, and 15 mm or greater difference between
oxycodone and placebo treatments on a 0–100 point,
100 mm bipolar Drug Liking Visual Analog Scale (VAS)
where
50 mm
represented
a
“neutral”
response;
2) 30 mm or greater difference between oxycodone and
placebo
treatments,
placebo
response between 0
and 10 mm on a 0–100 point unipolar Drug High VAS.
The volunteers must also have been generally able to
comply with study procedures and must have re-
sponded adequately to study-specific instructions made
by clinical staff. Those eligible to continue with the study
were subjected to a 24-hour washout period before be-
ginning
the
five-session

phase.
During the approximately two-week, inpatient, blinded
treatment phase, subjects were randomized to one of
the treatment sequences as depicted in Figure 2. Each
sequence consisted of five dosing periods, where sub-
jects would receive a single treatment of one of the
study medications or placebo as defined by the se-
quence, followed by a 72-hour washout period. Study
procedures were the same for each treatment. The five
treatments were 100, 200, and 400 mg of NKTR-181 in
solution, 40 mg oxycodone in solution, and the match-
ing placebo solution that contained the bittering agent
denatonium benzoate. Drug or placebo administration
generally occurred around 8 AM after an eight-hour fast
and
was

followed
by

240 mL of sugar-free cranberry grape juice.
Pharmacodynamic Assessments
Abuse potential and other behavioral and subjective end
points were assessed using the various computer-
administered VASs detailed in Table 1. Additional abuse
potential–related
end
points
included
the
Addiction
Research Center Inventory/Morphine Benzedrine Group
(ARCI/MBG) scale and the Price Value Assessment
Questionnaire (PVAQ). Pupil Diameter was measured
immediately prior to each pharmacokinetic blood sam-
ple to determine the time course of the mu-opioid CNS
effect.
The ARCI/MBG subscale, measured at one-half, one,
one and a half, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and
eight hours postdose, consisted of 16 statements used
to assess euphoria and positive mood, with each item
scored on a two-point scale (0 to 1), where 0 ¼ false
and 1 ¼ true. The total score was calculated by adding
the individual scores, with a possible total score of 16.
The PVAQ assessment asked subjects to estimate how
much they would pay (street value) for each of the med-
ications they received if the medications were illicitly
made available. Street value was assessed 24 hours af-
ter each dosing session and was selected from a $0–10
scale divided into 50 cent increments.
Pharmacokinetic Assessments
Plasma drug concentrations were quantified from blood
samples obtained predose (t ¼ 0) and at five, 10, 15,
30, 45 minutes; one, one and a half, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight, 12, and 24 hours postdose.
Safety Assessments
Safety assessments included treatment-emergent ad-
verse events (TEAEs), vital signs, 12-lead electrocardio-
gram
(ECG),
continuous
three-lead
telemetry,
continuous oxygen saturation monitoring for at least
eight hours postdose, and clinical laboratory tests. Vital
signs were measured predose and one, two, four, eight,
and 12 hours postdose. Laboratory tests were com-
pleted at screening and at study discharge; 12-lead
ECG readings were completed at screening, qualifica-
tion, and discharge, and three-lead telemetry was per-
formed continuously from predose through at least eight
hours postdose.
Statistical Analysis
The study was powered to detect a mean difference be-
tween 40 mg oxycodone and 200 mg NKTR-181 of 0.35
relative effect size (in terms of standard deviation units
of Drug Liking score 0–100 VAS) with 80% power, re-
sulting in a planned sample size of approximately 35
completing participants. Approximately 40 randomized
subjects were planned to participate in the study to
achieve the goal of 35 participants completing the five-
period crossover study.
The primary study objective was to compare the relative
abuse potential of NKTR-181 doses with 40 mg oxyco-
done. The primary abuse potential–related end points,
Drug Liking effect (Emax), area under the drug effect
curve from time zero to half an hour (AUE0–0.5h), zero
to one hour (AUE0–1h), zero to two hours (AUE0–2h),
and zero to three hours (AUE0–3h) for the bipolar Drug
Liking VAS were analyzed using a linear mixed model to
compare the treatment groups. The analysis population
was the modified intention-to-treat (MITT) population,
which included all randomized subjects who received at
least one dose of study medication and who had at
least one postdose assessment. The analysis model in-
cluded sequence, period, and treatment as fixed effects
and a random effect for subject nested within se-
quence. The time course of treatment of Drug Liking
was
investigated
using

 treatment interaction as fixed effects and a random ef-
fect for subject nested within treatment sequence. Least
squares means, least squares mean differences be-
tween the treatment groups, and 95% confidence inter-
vals were reported. No adjustments for multiplicity were
made for these analyses. Secondary end points in-
cluded maximal effect (Emax) for Drug High and ARCI/
MBG, Overall Drug Liking, and Take Drug Again (bipolar
scales) at 24 hours postdose, the PVAQ assessment,
and the Drug Effects Questionnaire. Secondary pharma-
codynamic end points, including pupillometry results,
were analyzed similar to the primary pharmacodynamic
end point, without adjustment of P values.
Pharmacokinetic analyses were conducted on all ran-
domized subjects who received at least one dose of

 study medication and had adequate plasma concentra-
tion time data to allow meaningful pharmacokinetic anal-
yses. Pharmacokinetics parameters analyzed included
time to maximum observed plasma concentration for
each subject (Tmax), maximum observed plasma con-
centration for each subject (Cmax), and area under the
plasma concentration vs time curve from time 0 to time
of the last observed concentration (AUC0-last).
Safety analyses were conducted on all randomized sub-
jects who received at least one dose of study drug dur-
ing the treatment phase.
Results
Disposition and Demographic Data
Forty-two subjects completed the qualification phase
and were randomized to the treatment phase (Figure 2).
Of these, two subjects prematurely discontinued the
study during the treatment phase (one for an AE of pain
in an extremity after one dosing session and one due to
childcare
issues
after
three
dosing
sessions).
Demographically,
subjects
were
predominantly
male
(73.8%) and white (81%). The mean (standard deviation)
age was 25.1 (5.3) years, and the mean (SD) body
mass index was 24.1 (3.5) kg/m2. All subjects had a
history of recreational opioid use, with the most preva-
lent major medication classifications cited as opioids
(100%, per study protocol), cannabinoids (85.7%), stim-
ulants (50.0%), hallucinogens (31.0%), sedative hyp-
notics (26.2%), and dissociative anesthetics (ketamine,
2.4%).
Pharmacodynamics
Mean Drug Liking scores for oxycodone increased rap-
idly, were near maximal within the first hour, and were
significantly elevated above values for placebo and all
dose levels of NKTR-181 (Figure 3A). For the primary
end point (Drug Liking Emax) and AUE over one-half,
one, two, and three hours postdose, scores for oxyco-
done were significantly greater compared with all doses
of NKTR-181 and placebo (P < 0.0001 all comparisons)
(Table 2). Drug Liking Emax for the 100 and 200 mg
NKTR-181 treatments were similar to those for placebo
(P ¼ 0.16 and P ¼ 0.24, respectively). Only the 400 mg
dose of NKTR-181 showed a Drug Liking Emax greater
than placebo (62.3 vs 55.0 mm, respectively), but the
onset of Drug Liking effects was delayed as seen in the
treatment
time
course
of
Drug
Liking
(Figure
3A).
Comparison of AUE values between NKTR-181 and
oxycodone yielded patterns similar to those for Drug
Liking Emax (Table 2). Time course data shows that
Drug Liking scores for oxycodone increased rapidly
(within 0.25 hour) and reached near maximum within the
first hour (Figure 3A). These effects remained signifi-
cantly higher (strong liking) than placebo until five hours
postdose. In contrast, NKTR-181 doses had slower on-
set (beginning approximately one and a half hours
postdose), shorter duration (two and a half hours), and
Drug Liking scores similar to placebo, with only a few
occurrences of statistically significant separation from
one and a half to four hours after the 400 mg NKTR-
181 dose (Figure 3A).
Similar to Drug Liking, Mean Drug High scores for oxyco-
done also increased rapidly, were near maximal within the
first hour, and were significantly elevated above values for
placebo and all dose levels of NKTR-181 (Figure 3B). The
mean Drug High Emax for oxycodone was significantly
greater compared with all doses of NKTR-181 and pla-
cebo (P < 0.0001) (Table 2). In contrast to oxycodone,
all NKTR-181 doses had a slower onset (beginning ap-
proximately one and a half hours postdose), shorter du-
ration (three and a half hours), and Drug High scores
similar to placebo, with only a few occurrences of statis-
tically significant separation from one and a half to five
hours after the 400 mg NKTR-181 dose (Figure 3B).
Consistent with Drug Liking and Drug High, values for
DEQ Good, Bad, Dizzy, Sleepy, Sick, and Nausea after
oxycodone administration were statistically greater than
those for NKTR-181 and placebo (Table 2 and Figure
4). Oxycodone produced robust effects on the ARCI/
MBG scale, yielding a mean Emax significantly greater
than
that
for
any
NKTR-181
dose
and
placebo
(P < 0.0001). In contrast, only the mean Emax for 400 mg
NKTR-181 differed significantly from placebo (Table 2).
Based on the PVAQ, the mean dollar value attributed to
oxycodone was significantly higher compared with all
NKTR-181
doses
(P < 0.0001)
(Table
2).
Global
Assessment of Overall Drug Liking and Take Drug Again
scale were measured 24 hours post–drug administration
and were the least sensitive to detect differences; re-
sults of these measures were inconsistent (Table 2).
Pupillometry
Pupillometry showed an early and extensive pharmaco-
dynamic response for oxycodone and delayed and re-
duced
pharmacodynamic
response
for
NKTR-181
(Figure 3C). Compared with oxycodone, all NKTR-181
doses had substantially slower onset of miosis, begin-
ning approximately 0.75 hours or later postdose (Figure
3C). Consistent with slower onset of miosis, mean Emin
was reached later postdose for all NKTR-181 doses
compared with oxycodone. Mean times to pupil diame-
ter Emin for oxycodone and 400 mg NKTR-181 were 1.4
and 4.3 hours (Table 2), consistent with previously re-
ported values of 1.1 [25] for oxycodone and 4.0 hours
for NKTR-181 (data on file).
Pharmacokinetics
The mean time to reach Cmax for oxycodone was ap-
proximately one hour, whereas mean times to reach
Cmax for NKTR-181 were longer and similar for all dose
groups (mean ¼ 2.0–2.5 hours after dosing). Dose-
normalized

among dose levels and consistent with values observed

 in phase I studies, indicating that exposure was propor-
tional to dose. Overall, oxycodone and NKTR-181 sys-
temic exposures were comparable with those previously
reported [23–25, 34].
Safety
There were no serious adverse events. As shown in
Table 3, all TEAEs were those typically associated with
the use of opioids, and the majority occurred following
oxycodone administration. The most frequently occur-
ring TEAE was generalized pruritus following administra-
tion of oxycodone (41.5%) and 200 or 400 mg NKTR-
181 (7.3% and 4.9%, respectively). This was followed
by nausea with oxycodone (29.3%) in contrast to
100 mg (2.5%), 200 mg (2.4%), and 400 mg (7.3%) of
NKTR-181. Vomiting occurred in 2.4% of subjects re-
ceiving 200 and 400 mg NKTR-181 compared with
24.4%
of
subjects
following
administration
of
oxycodone.
Discussion
Results of this study demonstrate that the novel mu-
opioid analgesic NKTR-181 showed a lower occurrence
of
CNS
effects
associated
with
abuse
potential.
Designed and performed according to the FDA’s 2010
Guidance for Industry Assessment of Abuse Potential of
Drugs in Humans, the study enrolled and randomized
non–physically dependent recreational drug users with a
history of opioid use who were able to discern between
oxycodone and placebo. As noted, NKTR-181 has
been shown to exhibit a relatively slow rate of entry into
the CNS that is inherent to the molecule and indepen-
dent of dose level, route of administration, or employ-
ment
of
a
controlled-release
or
abuse-deterrent
formulation. In addition, NKTR-181 has innate properties
of an IR opioid. Therefore, in this study, immediate-
release oxycodone was selected as the comparator and
both substances were administered in liquid form in or-
der to remove any potential confounding effects of for-
mulation from the analysis.
Consistent with many other studies of oxycodone abuse
potential, 40 mg oxycodone produced rapid and strong
drug liking effects indicative of high abuse potential [18–30]
and differed significantly compared with placebo on key
abuse potential outcome measures (eg, Emax of Drug
Liking VAS and Drug High VAS, P< 0.0001), confirming
the validity of this study. In contrast, the onset of effects re-
lated to Drug Liking for all doses of NKTR-181 were slower
and demonstrated significantly lower abuse potential, in-
cluding delayed and less robust CNS effects as measured
by pupil diameter changes in comparison with oxycodone.
The pattern
of separation between
the times that
plasma Cmax and maximum pupil constriction were
achieved, shown in Figure 1, is maintained for single
doses of NKTR-181 up to 1,200 mg, the highest dose
level studied to date [24, data on file], as well as after
pharmacokinetic steady-state is achieved using the
phase III dosing schedule of q12h [22]. These PK/PD
findings, combined with the results of the present hu-
man abuse potential study, support the hypotheses that
reducing the rate of drug transfer from blood into the
CNS by controlling the molecular structure of an opioid
can reduce abuse potential yet preserve CNS mu-opioid
agonist activity.
Figure 3 Drug Liking VAS, Drug High VAS, and pupill-
ometry results in the (MITT Population). Mean Drug
Liking and Drug High scores (A and B) for oxycodone
increased rapidly, were near maximal within the first
hour, and were significantly elevated above values for
placebo and all dose levels of NKTR-181. Pupillometry
profiles (C) show a rapid, early, and extensive pharma-
codynamic response for oxycodone and a delayed and
reduced pharmacodynamic response for NKTR-181.

 The primary abuse potential end point, Emax of Drug
Liking VAS score, is considered among the most direct,
robust, and sensitive self-reported measures indicative
of opioid abuse potential [8,31–33]. All NKTR-181 doses
produced significantly lower Drug Liking Emax scores
compared with the active comparator, 40 mg oxyco-
done (P < 0.0001). The 100 and 200 mg doses of
NKTR-181 exhibited Drug Liking scores that were indis-
tinguishable from placebo. The 400 mg NKTR-181 dose
was slightly differentiated from placebo, but the AUE
analysis showed this did not occur until more than one
hour postdose. Similar results were seen for the sec-
ondary end points, as well as for the incidence of opioid
TEAEs. Scores for the DEQ components Drug High,
Nausea, and Sleepy for all dose levels of NKTR-181
were typically not statistically different from placebo but
were
statistically
lower
than
those
for
oxycodone.
Collectively, the study showed that in recreational opioid
users NKTR-181 resulted in a slower onset and lower
magnitude
of
CNS
effects
and
substantially
lower
scores for measures of abuse potential and side effects
typical of prototypic opioid analgesics.

 Concentration time profiles and pharmacokinetic param-
eters for NKTR-181 in this study were comparable with
those previously observed at the same dose levels in
healthy
subjects
participating
in
phase
I
studies
[15,22,23]. When adjusted for differences in adminis-
tered dose, the pharmacokinetic profile of oxycodone
solution observed in the study was consistent with pre-
viously published data [25,34].
The FDA is encouraging pharmaceutical companies
to develop new analgesics that deter tampering and
abuse through 1) formulations with physical/chemical
barriers that deter crushing, grinding, and dissolving;
2) prodrugs that prevent the in vitro conversion to
the parent opioid; and 3) new molecular entities,
including those that result in slower penetration into
the central nervous system [8]. NKTR-181 is a new
molecular entity (NME), and modulation of NKTR-181
entry into the CNS is achieved via physiochemical
properties at the molecular level, rather than through
formulation. To date, no conventional chemical or
physical methods that alter the NKTR-181 molecule
to accelerate the entry of a mu-opioid agonist into
the CNS have been identified. Efforts to chemically
manipulate the molecule have degraded the pharma-
cophore to render it inactive as a mu-opioid agonist
(data on file).
NKTR-181 was placed in Schedule II during develop-
ment, as are all thebaine-derived opioid molecules.
Figure 4 Mean responses to the DEQ questions at each observation time by treatment. Consistent with Drug Liking
and Drug High responses over time, mean values for all DEQ responses after oxycodone administration were statistically
greater than those for NKTR-181 and placebo.
Abuse Potential of New Opioid Analgesic NKTR-181
315
Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/painmedicine/article-abstract/19/2/307/3065794 by guest on 01 June 2019
 Results of this human abuse potential study raise the
possibility that NKTR-181 may merit less restrictive
Controlled Substances Act (CSA) scheduling than proto-
typic Schedule II opioids and/or may warrant abuse-
deterrent labeling claims consistent with the FDA’s 2010
and 2015 Guidance pertaining to abuse potential, CSA
scheduling, and abuse deterrence.
In summary, results of this human abuse potential study
provide clinical evidence that NKTR-181 has lower
abuse potential than oxycodone at NKTR-181 doses
currently being tested in an ongoing phase III safety and
efficacy trial (clinicaltrials.gov NCT02362672). Although
NKTR-181 at the highest dose (400 mg) demonstrated
more drug liking than placebo, the magnitude of these
effects was small and the onset was delayed (>1 hour)
compared with oxycodone. Future studies are planned
to evaluate the effect of supratherapeutic doses of
NKTR-181 as well as the impact of intranasal and in-
haled administration. We conclude that NKTR-181 may
fulfill an unmet need in providing safe and effective
treatment
for
moderate
to
severe
chronic
pain
conditions with reduced abuse potential and a lower in-
cidence of CNS-mediated opioid adverse events.
