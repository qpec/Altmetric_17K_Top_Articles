Abstract: 1 million people are predicted to get infected with Lyme disease in the USA in 2018.
Given the same incidence rate of Lyme disease in Europe as in the USA, then 2.4 million people
will get infected with Lyme disease in Europe in 2018. In the USA by 2050, 55.7 million people
(12% of the population) will have been infected with Lyme disease. In Europe by 2050, 134.9 million
people (17% of the population) will have been infected with Lyme disease. Most of these infections
will, unfortunately, become chronic. The estimated treatment cost for acute and chronic Lyme
disease for 2018 for the USA is somewhere between 4.8 billion USD and 9.6 billion USD and for
Europe somewhere between 10.1 billion EUR and 20.1 billion EUR. If governments do not finance IV
treatment with antibiotics for chronic Lyme disease, then the estimated government cost for chronic
Lyme disease for 2018 for the USA is 10.1 billion USD and in Europe 20.1 billion EUR. If governments
in the USA and Europe want to minimize future costs and maximize future revenues, then they
should pay for IV antibiotic treatment up to a year even if the estimated cure rate is as low as 25%.
The cost for governments of having chronic Lyme patients sick in perpetuity is very large.

1. Introduction
The objectives of this article are to investigate the incidence rate of Lyme disease in the USA and
Europe, to investigate the financial cost of chronic Lyme disease and to find the most cost-efficient way
for the governments to solve the current chronic Lyme disease pandemic [1]. Very few studies exist
that calculate the economic impact of chronic Lyme disease [2]. According to the European Centre
for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), Lyme disease—also known as Borreliosis—is caused by
a spirochete bacteria called Borrelia burgdorferi [3]. An early stage Borrelia infection is known as acute
Lyme disease and a late stage Borrelia infection is known as chronic Lyme disease. A Lyme disease
“war” has been going for a long time [4,5] between two doctors’ associations regarding the most
appropriate way to diagnose and treat Lyme disease. The two doctors associations are the Infectious
Diseases Society of America (IDSA) [6] and International Lyme and Associated Diseases Society
(ILADS) [7]. IDSA represents infectious disease doctors that firmly believe that all Lyme disease
infections, regardless of whether the infection is acute or chronic, can successfully and easily be treated
with three weeks of oral antibiotic [8] despite the fact that no scientific studies currently exist that
support the claim that three weeks of oral antibiotics can always cure acute or chronic Lyme disease [9]
and there exist many scientific studies that have shown that the Borrelia bacteria can survive three weeks
of oral antibiotics in vitro [10,11] and in vivo, in mice [12–15], dogs [16], horses [17], monkeys [18] and
in humans [19–36]. The in vivo references have mostly been extracted from [37–39]. Alive Borrelia
bacteria has been found in 7 out of 8 patients with chronic Lyme disease [40]. The immune system
by itself can never eradicate a Borrelia infection [41–44] and no scientific studies exist that show that

bacterial infections can simply disappear. Approximately 63% [45,46] of people today that are infected
with Borrelia, unfortunately, develop chronic Lyme disease. Most Lyme disease patients today either do
not receive any antibiotic treatment at all or they receive an insufficient amount of antibiotic treatment.
The IDSA does not recognize chronic Lyme disease, nor do they recommend antibiotic treatment for
chronic Lyme disease. The IDSA calls chronic Lyme disease post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome
(PTLDS) [47] but it has been suggested that this term is a misnomer and should not be used [48].
Because chronic Lyme disease is classified as a syndrome instead of an infection, the IDSA therefore
does not recommend antibiotic treatment for chronic Lyme disease.
In 2006, the IDSA treatment guidelines development process was subjected to an antitrust
investigation by the Connecticut Attorney General [49], which found that many IDSA treatment
panel members had conflicts of interest [50]. In November 2017, another antitrust lawsuit (Civil Action
No 17-cv-190) [51,52] was directed at the IDSA along with several large insurance companies in
the USA and several IDSA medical doctors, in a federal court in Texarkana, Texas in the USA.
The allegations concern violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act
and the Sherman Antitrust Act. According to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ),
which is part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 86% of health care costs in 2010
in the USA came from patients with one or more chronic conditions [53]. The concern is that because
Intravenous (IV) antibiotic treatment for people with chronic Lyme disease costs so much money,
insurance companies in the USA may gain by colluding with the IDSA to ensure chronic Lyme disease
is not classified as a real disease caused by bacteria, so that IV antibiotic treatment can be denied.
The scientific process fails if it can be controlled by a group or groups with a particular agenda [54].
The IDSA’s treatment guidelines for Lyme disease are problematic in the following ways: (A) They
do not follow The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine recommendations
on how to develop treatment guidelines [55] because the IDSA treatment guideline panel did not
consist of a diversified and balanced group of doctors nor did the panel include patient representatives;
(B) More than 50% of IDSAs treatment guidelines are based only on “expert opinion” [56]; (C) The
IDSA’s treatment guidelines for Lyme disease do reflect the fact that, according to the CDC, Lyme
disease can lead to death if not treated with antibiotics [57]. The CDC has, however, significantly
underestimated the number of deaths caused by chronic Lyme disease. One study estimates that
chronic Lyme disease and associated diseases could be the cause of over 1200 suicides per year in
the USA [58].
The International Lyme and Associated Diseases Society (ILADS) represents Lyme Literate
Medical Doctors (LLMDs) from around the world who recognize that chronic Lyme disease is a real
and serious disease that must be treated with long-term antibiotics [59]. ILADS’ treatment guidelines
for Lyme disease can be found on the National Guidelines Clearinghouse (NGC) web page [60].
According to ILADS, Lyme disease is a clinical diagnosis that is based on the symptoms a patient
presents. LLMDs prefer to treat chronic Lyme disease patients with IV antibiotics because IV antibiotics
are more effective than oral antibiotics [61]. However, oral antibiotics are much easier to administer,
and they are not as expensive as IV antibiotics. Hence, in a situation where a patient cannot afford
IV antibiotics, or if a patient has difficulties finding someone to administer IV antibiotics, then oral
antibiotics are always preferred over no antibiotics. LLMDs can, if necessary, treat a patient with
chronic Lyme disease with oral antibiotics for the rest of the patient’s life. Thus, similarities exist
between chronic Lyme disease and the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) that also cannot be
eradicated with oral medication.
Up until December 2017, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the USA
officially endorsed the IDSA treatment guidelines for Lyme disease. What the CDC’s view on
treatment for chronic Lyme disease is today is unclear [62]. The CDC still uses the IDSA terminology
‘post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome’ (PTLDS) [63]. It is unlikely that the IDSA’s lack of medical
ethics when it comes to Lyme disease [64] was the reason why the CDC stopped officially endorsing
IDSA treatment guidelines for Lyme disease, because in 2016 an anonymous whistleblower group
 Healthcare 2018, 6, 16
3 of 51
of scientists from within the CDC, calling themselves CDC Scientists Preserving Integrity, Diligence
and Ethics in Research (CDC SPIDER), raised concerns about the CDC’s lack of independence and
ethics [65], stating, “We are a group of scientists at CDC that are very concerned about the current state
of ethics at our agency. It appears that our mission is being influenced and shaped by outside parties
and rogue interests”. The CDC therefore most likely stopped endorsing the IDSA treatment guidelines
because legal and public pressure was building up. Today people are becoming more aware of chronic
Lyme disease. The conflict over what the best ways are to diagnose and treat Lyme disease have gone
so far that a Tick-Borne Disease Working Group was created when the 21st-century cures act became
law in the USA in December 2016 [66]. The objective of the working group is to review the scientific
literature, regarding for example causes, prevention, diagnosis, duration, surveillance and treatment
for Lyme disease and associated diseases.
The genus Borrelia was named in honor of the French bacteriologist Amédée Borrel in 1907 [67].
The name Lyme comes from the name of the town in Connecticut in the USA where the disease was
”first” observed in 1977 [68] this despite the fact that the German physician Alfred Buchwald published
the first case of atrophy of the skin already in 1883 [69]. In 1902 Herxheimer and Hartmann named
such atrophy of the skin Acrodermatitis Chronica Atrophicans (ACA) [70] which is why ACA, which is
dermatological disorder mostly associated with chronic Lyme disease in Europe [71], sometimes is
called Herxheimer disease. ACA presents its self as a red-bluish discoloration of the extremities [72].
The link between Lyme disease and the bacteria that cause it was first discovered by the medical
entomologist Dr. Willy Burgdorfer in 1982 [73]. The bacteria, therefore, took the name after its
discoverer Borrelia Burgdorferi. It was first in 1929 when the serendipitous discovery of penicillin
was made by scientist Alexander Fleming [74] that treatment for Lyme disease became available.
Penicillin was originally produced from mold. Naturally occurring antibiotics can also be produced by
fermentation, an old technique that can be traced back almost 8000 years [75]. The genes that convey
antibiotic resistance to bacteria have been around for at least 30,000 years [76], which means that
antibiotic resistance to a large part has not been developed during the last 88 years humankind has
known about antibiotics which is a fact that we rarely hear about though.
One of the first people to treat chronic Lyme, or more specifically ACA, with penicillin in
1949 was Nils Thyresson [77] who was a Swedish medical doctor and professor of Dermatology
and Venereology. The first human believed to have been infected with Lyme disease was Ötzi
the Iceman [78]. This 5300 years old naturally preserved mummy was discovered in 1991 in the Ötztal
Alps on the border between Austria and Italy. Spirochete bacteria are believed to be much older this
though. Spirochetes similar to Borrelia has been found in a 15 million years old tick preserved in
amber in the Dominican Republic [79] which means that the spirochete bacteria that causes Lyme
disease is much older than humankind. The complete Borrelia genome was first sequenced in 1997 [80].
The Borrelia bacteria has the most complex genomic architecture among known prokaryotes [81].
Borrelia bacteria are also very genetically diversified [82,83]. Different Borrelia strains have different
antigens [84] which means that different Borrelia strains will produce different immune system
responses in the form of antibodies in an infected host. A blood test that only test for one specific
antibody cannot detect antibodies from different Borrelia strains. A person that is infected with one
type of Borrelia strain will also have different symptoms compared to a person that is infected with
a different Borrelia strain [85]. For example, arthritis is usually not seen in European Lyme disease
patients [86] due to the different Borrelia strains that exist in Europe compared to the USA which means
that the lack of arthritis in a patient should not be interpreted as the patient not having Lyme disease.
Lyme disease diagnosis and treatment are further complicated by the fact that Borrelia also has many
different co-infections [87] such as Babesia, Bartonella, Ehrlichia, etc. It is believed that a vector such
as a tick can spread at least 237 different types of bacteria [88] and many types of viruses [89] which
means that many chronic Lyme patients might be infected with many different types of microbes at
the same time.

In the Lyme disease documentary Under Our Skin, Dr. Burgdorfer says: “The controversy in
the Lyme disease research is a shameful affair and I say this because the whole thing is politically
tainted. Money goes to the same people who have for the last thirty years produced the same thing.
Nothing.” [90]. The Borrelia bacteria has at least three different morphological forms. (1) A spirochete
form [91]. (2) A round body form that is also known as cyst form [92]. (3) A biofilm form [93].
The Borrelia bacteria evade the immune system by for example changing morphology [94] and by
changing its outer surface proteins (Osp) also known as antigens [95–98]. When the bacteria change
its antigens all the time, the specific antibodies that are produced by the immune system to try to
eradicate the infection becomes useless. The DNA structure that is believed to be responsible for
the bacteria’s antigenic variation ability is called G-quadruplex (G4) [99]. Immune system evasion by
other diseases such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) [100] and cancer [101] is also believed to
be connected to G4. Exciting research is being done that is trying to find medications that block G4
for the Borrelia bacteria [102]. If the researchers are successful, it could mean an end to chronic Lyme
disease but also to other diseases. If the immune system in combination with some drug could eradicate
the Borrelia bacteria that would be a superior solution compared to a possible lifetime of oral antibiotics.
The bacteria evade being killed by broad-spectrum antibiotics by changing morphology [103]. Note
that the bacteria ability to evade broad-spectrum antibiotics should not be interpreted as antibiotic
resistant. Metronidazole/Tinidazole forces the bacteria to take a spirochete form [104,105] where other
broad-spectrum antibiotics such as Azithromycin can kill it off. When chronic Lyme patients are treated
with a macrolide antibiotic such as Azithromycin in combination with Metronidazole/Tinidazole, then
the physician can also give Plaquenil which is an anti-malaria medication. Plaquenil raises the PH level
in cells so that macrolide antibiotics can work more effectively [106]. Unfortunately, Plaquenil does
not work for tetracycline antibiotics [107]. It is, however, important to note that Plaquenil can cause
eye problems [108] which means that not all patients can tolerate this medication.
Because different combinations of antibiotics have different effects on the different morphological
forms of the Borrelia bacteria [109], ILADS treatment guidelines recommend combination therapy with
two different types antibiotics for chronic Lyme disease [110] for example metronidazole/tinidazole
in combination with azithromycin/doxycycline. The recommended treatment for chronic Lyme
disease is therefore different from the recommended treatment for acute Lyme by the IDSA which is,
monotherapy with one antibiotic for example doxycycline. Again, similarities exist between HIV and
chronic Lyme disease because both are treated with combination therapy. The reason for combination
therapy for HIV and chronic Lyme disease is however different. Combination therapy in HIV is
motivated by the fact that the virus develops resistance to the medication if you only treat with one
antiviral medication. For chronic Lyme disease, this is not the cases. Combination therapy for chronic
Lyme disease is motivated by the fact that the Borrelia bacteria changes morphology which means that
monotherapy is not an effective treatment for Lyme disease.
A common mistake is to describe the symptoms of Lyme disease as “flu-like”. A serious Lyme
disease infection should not be reduced to a simple cold. A better screening symptom for Lyme disease
is paresthesia. Paresthesia manifests itself as vibrating sensation under the skin. One study estimates
that 53% of patients with chronic Lyme disease develop paresthesia [111]. A second study estimates
that 70% of patients with chronic Lyme disease develop paresthesia [112]. The good thing is that
the paresthesia stops when antibiotics have killed off the infection [113] but also during treatment
with antibiotics such as Metronidazole or Tinidazole. There are three main questions that need to
be answered to justify treatment for chronic Lyme disease. (1) Do chronic Lyme disease patients
without treatment suffer from a low Quality of Life (QOL) than the general population? Four National
Institute of Health (NIH) studies have shown that the answer to that question is yes [114]. (2) Are
the symptoms of chronic Lyme disease patients reduced because of antibiotic treatment? The answer
to that question is yes [115–119]. (3) Can an untreated chronic Lyme disease lead to premature death?
The answer to that question is yes according to our previous CDC reference. There exist a few studies
that show that the symptoms of chronic Lyme patients do not improve with antibiotics treatment.

There exist at least two problems with these studies. (1) They usually treat chronic Lyme patients with
monotherapy which again is not a recommended treatment. (2) They have used flawed statistical
methods [120]. Medical doctors should be able to use their professional expertise and in consultation
with their patients determine the most appropriate treatment for patients.
A European study [121] estimates the sensitivity of the Lyme disease test to 44%. Such number
was found by analyzing the performance of eight different Lyme disease tests. 89 different blood
samples were tested for each test manufacturer. The sample also included healthy controls. Another
study [122] that conducted a meta-analysis of the American scientific literature (eight scientific articles)
regarding the performance of the Lyme disease test estimates the sensitivity of the Lyme disease test
to 46% and the specificity to 99%. Because the blood tests that are used today by government health
agencies to detect the human body’s production of antibodies against the Borrelia bacteria’s antigens
are so insensitive Lyme disease, today must be defined as a clinical diagnosis as correctly advocated by
ILADS. If a patient has had a blood test that suggests a Lyme disease infection that is fine, but a positive
blood test should not be a requirement for a diagnosis. A person that suspect a Lyme disease infection
is today, unfortunately, better of tossing a coin and diagnosing themselves because the blood tests for
Lyme disease today will miss most infections. Specific antibodies often cannot be found in patients
with Lyme disease because of the bacteria ability to shift its antigens.
Testing cerebrospinal fluid instead of blood will not improve test sensitivity because
the bacteria can still shift its antigens in cerebrospinal fluid which means that the probability
of detecting specific antibodies in cerebrospinal fluid is not larger than in blood.
Moreover,
cerebrospinal fluid causes the bacteria to change its morphology from a spirochete form to a cyst
from [123]. If you only diagnose Lyme disease in patients that have specific antibodies in their blood
or cerebrospinal fluid, you will miss most cases. To better understand Lyme disease testing let’s look at
the confusion matrix [124]. All calculations can be found in the macro-enabled excel file “Lyme disease
model.xlsm”. We assume in Table 1 that the number of people in the disease and control groups are
known and equal. In real life, however, we do not know the number of people in the disease and
control group. We can only observe the total number of people that tested positive in both groups.
We can now plot the number of people that tested positive in both groups (z) and the % number
of people that tested positive in both groups (zz) when the number of infected people in the disease
group (x) and the number of healthy people in control groups (y) are unknown as seen in Figures 1
and 2.

We can now assume that the number of healthy people in the control group (y) = p × the number
of sick people in the disease group (x). The relationship between y, x and p can be seen in Figure 3.
Figure 3. The relationship between y, x and p.
We now can adjust the equation for z and zz to include p as seen in Figures 4 and 5. It can be hard
to see in Figure 5 (it is better to look in the excel file directly) but zz has the same value for all x values
for any given value of p which means that you can never find a value for x (and a value for y thanks to
y = x × p) only given values for se, sp, p and zz. I have also written a sub procedure in VBA called
zzz() that also can be found in the excel file “Lyme disease model.xlsm” that can be called by simply
pressing a button that calculates zz given a Lyme disease test sensitivity (se) equal to 0.44 and a Lyme
disease test specificity of (sp) equal to 0.99.

algebra as seen in Table 2.

The equation we need to solve is the following:

2. Methods
The first limitation of this study is that we are using the incidence rate of Lyme disease from
the USA on the population of Europe to get an estimate on how frequent Lyme disease is in Europe.
Using the incidence rate from the USA on the population of Europe is not optimal but unfortunately,
our only choice since the ECDC do not have any data on Lyme disease. Lyme disease is not spread
exclusively by vectors such as ticks. One study [125] explains that Lyme disease is also a Sexually
Transmitted Disease (STD). Since Lyme disease can spread sexually, the growth rate of the disease will
be similar in the USA and Europe which means that it’s not unrealistic to use the disease frequency
from the USA on Europe’s population. The second limitation of this study is that scientific literature
that exists regarding Lyme disease as an STD is very limited. In a perfect world more, research
should be done regarding Lyme disease as an STD but please keep in mind that Borrelia’s close cousin
the spirochete bacterium Treponema pallidum that causes syphilis is well known to spread sexually.
Hence, the fact that the Borrelia bacteria can also or could also spread through sexual contact should
not come as a surprise. Unfortunately, accurately modeling the spread of Lyme disease without
sexual transmission is close to impossible because there are so many difficult questions that need
to be answered regarding tick ecology [126] for example in which geographic areas are ticks most
frequent?, how many different types of ticks exists?, which types of ticks spread disease?, what types
of microorganisms do ticks contain?, how often do ticks reproduce?, when they reproduce how many
eggs do they produce on average?, how many of these eggs survive?, what is the probability that
a tick bites a human?, what is the probability that a tick bites an animal?, what is the probability
of a transmission of Borrelia or any other microorganism after a tick bite?, what animals do ticks use
for transportation deer, bird or rodent, how many of these animals that transport ticks are there in
a given geographic area?, how is a tick population affected by cold temperature like a winter? As I
said, the epidemiological modeling becomes close to impossible especially for an economist maybe not
for a biologist.
All infectious diseases (total number of infections in a population) that are transmitted from
person to person and where treatment is inadequate has by nature exponential growth over time.
A pandemic initially starts with 1 infected person (total number of infections at t1 = 1) that person then
goes and infect 1 more person (total number of infections at t2 = 2), these 2 infected people then go and
infect 2 more people (total number of infections at t3 = 4), these 4 people then go and infect 4 more
 Healthcare 2018, 6, 16

people (total number of infections at t4 = 8) etc. The % change at t2 = ((2−1)/1) × 100 = 100, the %
change at t3 = ((4−2)/2) × 100 = 100, the % change at t4 = ((8−4)/4) × 100 = 100. Since the percentage
change is constant over time, exponential growth models are also called constant growth rate models.
For a linear growth model, the percentage change is decreasing over time. The relationship between
the transmission rate of an infection that is spread through sexual contact and the annual growth rate
of infection can be seen in Table 5. We can see that given that each infected person has sex with one
healthy person each year then the transmission rate is equal to the annual percentage growth rate
of infection for an infectious disease that is spread sexually. The third limitation of this study is that we
assume that the annual growth rate for Lyme disease is 2%. To my knowledge, there does not exist any
scientific literature regarding the annual growth rate of Lyme disease. The 2% number is therefore not
based on empirical observation. However, we can compare such number to other infectious diseases
that are also spread through sexual contact such as HIV. According to the CDC, HIV in 1977 had
a transmission rate of 100% and in 2006 the transmission rate of HIV was 5% [127]. It becomes obvious
that 2% is a very conservative number. The annual growth rate of Lyme disease is most likely higher
than 2% because unfortunately many Lyme disease patients and especially chronic Lyme patients are
struggling to find antibiotic treatment but since I lack a scientific reference for my claim and because I
do not want to inflate the numbers I have chosen to report 2%. The fourth limitation of this study is
that the scientific literature regarding how successful IV treatment is at curing chronic Lyme disease is
very limited. However, the exact cure rate is not that important because we have known for a long
time that antibiotics kill bacteria. We can simply assume that the cure rate is unknown and compare
the outcome of five different assumed cure rates and scenarios: 0%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%.

equal to the annual percentage growth rate of infection

3. Results
According to one scientific study [128], that can be found on the CDC website and published
in Clinical Infectious Diseases which is a “scientific” journal issued by the IDSA 2.4 million individual
Lyme disease blood tests were done in the USA 2008. That number comes from a survey that was
sent to seven of the largest commercial laboratories in the USA. The most interesting part of such
publication an equation was not included in the article itself but was present in the supplementary
data [129]. The equation that the entire paper is based on is:
Observed % positive = % True Infection × Sensitivity + (1 − % True Infection) × (1 − Specificity)
If we multiply the above equation by the number of individual Lyme disease blood tests that
were performed in 2008 in the USA, then we get the observed number of Lyme disease infections in
the USA in 2008 by the CDC.
Observed positive = (% True Infection × Sensitivity + (1 − % True Infection) × (1 − Specificity)) ×
Number of Lyme disease tests
We solve the first equation for % True infection.
% True Infection = (Observed % Positive + Specificity − 1) / (Specificity + Sensitivity − 1)
If we multiply the above equation by the number of individual Lyme disease blood tests that were
performed in 2008 in the USA, then we get CDC’s predicted number of Lyme disease infections in
the USA in 2008.
True Infection = ((Observed % Positive + Specificity − 1) / (Specificity + Sensitivity − 1)) ×
Number of Lyme disease tests
The CDC study estimated three different scenarios: high, low and average with an assumed test
sensitivity of 66.9% and assumed specificity of 96.1%. Unfortunately, the only value for observed %
positive that the CDC provides was 11.89%, which was the average scenario. The other two are not
reported in the paper and need to be calculated. Why is the observed % positive variable so important
for our calculations later? The observed % positive value has not been adjusted for the sensitivity
and specificity of the Lyme disease blood test. Therefore, we can use our values for sensitivity and
specificity. The observed % positive values do also not include any assumptions about the relationship
between the number of sick people in the disease group (x) and the number of healthy people in
the control group (y) that we previously defined as p. The CDC calculations can be found in Table 6.

We can see that the CDC has unrealistically and secretly assumed without motivation or
explanation that the size of the control group with healthy people is 9 (low scenario), 8.5 (average
scenario) and 4.4 (high scenario) times the size of the disease group with infected people (p = 9, p = 8.5
and p = 4.4). These assumed p-values cannot be empirically observed because it is impossible to know
the value of p by simply looking at the total number of people that test positive in the control and
disease group (z). It would be more realistic to assume that the size of the control group with healthy
people is the same size as the disease group with infected people (p = 1). Because blood testing today
is so primitive (you can more or less only test for one pathogen at the time) and because the blood tests
for Lyme disease are so insensitive most people today will only test to get a confirmation that they are
infected. Hence, many people will only test if they are infected. It is therefore unrealistic to expect
that a lot of people without an infection will demand to get tested just for “fun” because there is also
a personal financial cost involved. The CDC also claims in their paper that the value of the variable
observed % positive was the same as the value for the variable predicted % positive for the average
scenario which is mathematically impossible as seen in Figure 8 using the same assumptions regarding
Lyme disease test sensitivity and specificity as the CDC. Such claim by the CDC, therefore, does not
make any sense.

Given the CDC unrealistic assumptions regarding se, sp and p, it appears that the equation is
more or less correct. There is, however, an unexplained difference of +418 infections for the high
scenario. We can also see that if the CDC had assumed that p = 1 in combination with the CDC
assumptions se = 0.669, sp = 0.961, then the number of Lyme disease infections in the USA for 2008
for the high scenario would have been 527,288 instead of 444,000. We can also see that the difference
between the CDC model with CDC assumptions of se = 0.669, sp = 0.961, p(low) = 9, p(average) = 8.5
and p(high) = 4.4 and my model with my assumptions of se = 0.44, sp = 0.99 and p = 1 is lowest for
the CDC high scenario hence I will report that in 2008 in the USA the estimated number of Lyme
disease infections is 829,600. The data and calculations that I will present now can be found in the excel
file “Lyme disease calculations.xlsx.” Given 829,600 Lyme disease infections in 2008 in the USA and
an assumed annual infection growth rate of 2% then in 2018 in the USA approximately 1 million people
will get infected with Lyme disease. The total number of Lyme disease infections that we can expect in
the USA from 2008 to 2050 is 55.7 million. Given an annual population growth rate in the USA of 1%
and given that everyone that is infected from 2008 to 2050 is still alive than 12% of the population in
the USA will have been infected with Lyme disease in 2050. The plots are presented in Figures 9–12.

Since the ECDC does not have any statistics on how frequent Lyme disease is in Europe, it is
difficult to determine an exact figure for the number of Lyme disease cases in Europe in 2008. However,
we can use the incidence rate (frequency) from the USA for 2008 on Europe’s population for 2008 to get
an estimate. The estimated number of Lyme disease infections in Europe in 2008 is 2,008,505. Given
2,008,505 Lyme disease infections in 2008 in Europe and an assumed annual infection growth rate
of 2% then in 2018 in Europe approximately 2.4 million people will get infected with Lyme disease.
The total number of Lyme disease infections that we can expect in Europe from 2008 to 2050 is 134.9
million. Given an annual population growth rate in Europe of 0.2% and given that everyone that is
infected from 2008 to 2050 is still alive than 17% of the population of Europe will have been infected
with Lyme disease in 2050. The plots are presented in Figures 13–16.

According to our previous scientific reference, 63% of people that are infected with Borrelia
develop chronic Lyme disease. The estimated number of people suffering from chronic Lyme disease
in 2050 in the USA and Europe depend on the assumption we make regarding the estimated cure rate
for chronic Lyme disease treatment and on the assumption that everyone that develop chronic Lyme
disease from 2008 to 2050 is still alive. The last assumption is very uncertain because of how difficult
it is today for chronic Lyme patients to get treatment. We can see in Table 8 and Figure 17 that the
number of people that will suffer from chronic Lyme disease in 2050 in the USA with a 0% cure rate
is approximately 35 million (8% of the USA population in 2050), with a 25% cure rate 26 million (6%
of the USA population in 2050), with a 50% cure rate 18 million (4% of the USA population in 2050),
with a 75% cure rate 9 million (2% of the USA population in 2050) and with a 100% cure rate zero (0%
of the USA population in 2050).

If 2,008,505 people were infected with Lyme disease in Europe in 2008 and go undetected by
the non-exist statistics what types of illnesses can Lyme disease patients be misdiagnosed with? It is
therefore not unrealistic to assume that some Lyme disease patients are misdiagnosed with illnesses
such as for example fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), heart arrhythmia, multiple sclerosis
(MS), restless legs syndrome (RLS), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson disease, systemic
lupus erythematosus (SLE), Gulf War Syndrome (GWS) or Alzheimer’s disease. The commonality
between these diseases is that there is currently no known cure. Before we can start to estimate
costs for Lyme disease, we need to discuss the tax on disability benefits. The tax rate on disabilities

on disability benefits is irrelevant to the government because assuming the government keeps the
amount of disability benefit after tax fixed an increased tax rate on disability benefits will not increase
the government’s financial balance (government revenues + government costs) as seen in Table 10.
If a government raises the tax rate on a person’s disability benefit, then the increased tax revenues
from such tax raise are completely offset by the larger government cost for the disability benefit.

We can now estimate the costs for Lyme disease treatment in the USA and Europe for the year
2018. We have previously estimated that the number of infections in the USA for 2018 is approximately
1 million. In Europe, that number is approximately 2.4 million. Let’s assume that in the USA for
2018 the annual cost for oral antibiotics is 1400 USD and the annual cost for IV antibiotics is 15,000
USD. In Europe, the estimated annual cost for oral antibiotics is 1200 EUR and the annual cost for
IV antibiotics is 13,000 EUR. Currently, the treatment cost for IV antibiotics for chronic Lyme disease
are paid by the individual and not by the government or insurance companies. Note that the cost
of IV treatment for chronic Lyme disease can be different in the USA and Europe because in the USA
a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) is preferred while in Europe an IV drip is preferred.
The cost for IV treatment in Europe could easily be twice as large because patients must travel a long
way and stay at a hotel close to a specialized chronic Lyme disease clinic to get daily IV treatments
with a butterfly needle. Sometimes people are even forced to sell their house to afford treatment.
We assume that acute Lyme disease is treated with oral antibiotics for one month and that chronic
Lyme disease is treated with IV antibiotics for six months or one year. Chronic Lyme disease can also
be treated with oral antibiotics but then the patient runs the risk of having to take oral antibiotics
for the rest of his/her life. I have therefore not calculated the cost of treating chronic Lyme with
oral antibiotics since its more realistic to assume that all chronic Lyme patients want to treat with IV
antibiotics because then they will at least have a chance of getting cured of their “chronic” infection.
We can see in Tables 11 and 12 that the estimated treatment cost for Lyme disease for 2018 for the
USA is somewhere between 4.8 billion USD and 9.6 billion USD and for Europe somewhere between
10.1 billion EUR and 20.1 billion EUR depending on the assumptions we make regarding the length
of treatment with IV antibiotics (six months vs. one year). We can also see that the cost of treating
acute Lyme disease with oral antibiotics for one month only represents 0.6% of the average treatment
cost for IV antibiotics. The cost of treating acute Lyme disease with oral antibiotics is so small that it
barely has an impact on total treatment costs.

We have so far only looked at treatment cost. Many people are forced to leave their jobs due to
the infection. So, the cost of lost personal income is also high. According to one study, approximately
42% of chronic Lyme disease patients cannot work [132]. I believe that the number is even higher but
42% is reasonable enough. The financial cost for both the individual (lost earnings from not working
due to chronic Lyme disease) and for the government (lost tax revenues because chronic Lyme patients
are not working and disability benefits for chronic Lyme disease patients) are therefore significant.
We can now calculate the government cost for chronic Lyme disease for the USA and Europe for 2018 if
governments do not finance treatment. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and
Development (OECD) the average annual wage rate before tax for 2016 for the USA was 60 154 USD
and for Germany 38,302 EUR [133]. The average annual wage rate in Germany represents the average
annual wage rate for Europe. The global accounting firm KPMG states that the income tax rate for 2016
for the USA is 39.6% and for Germany 45% [134]. A website called disabilitysecrets.com [135] claims
that the average monthly Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) payment after tax for the USA for
2017 is 1171 USD which means that the average annual disability benefit after tax for the USA for 2017
is 14,052 USD. This amount is on par with the lowest monthly disability payment after taxed paid in
Sweden which is 11,000 Swedish kroner [136] which means that the minimum annual disability benefit
after tax for Sweden is 132,000 Swedish kroner which as of October 2017 is approximately 13,778 EUR.
We will use the monthly Swedish disability payment to represent the disability payment in Europe.
We can see in Tables 13 and 14 that the estimated lost personal income for chronic Lyme patients
that are not working for 2018 for the USA is 16.1 billion USD and in Europe 24.8 billion EUR.
If the governments in the USA and Europe do not finance IV treatment with antibiotics for chronic
Lyme disease, then the estimated government costs for chronic Lyme disease (lost tax revenues because
some chronic Lyme patients are not working plus disability benefits for chronic Lyme patients that not
working) for 2018 for the USA is 10.1 billion USD and for Europe 20.1 billion EUR. We can also see that
the government cost for chronic Lyme disease for 2018 (which does not include treatment costs) in
the USA is 2.1 times larger than the cost for 6 months of IV treatment with antibiotics in the USA for
2018 and 1.1 times larger than the cost for 1 year of IV treatment with antibiotics in the USA for 2018.
In Europe, the government cost for chronic Lyme disease for 2018 is two times larger than the cost for
six months of IV treatment in Europe for 2018 and the government cost is on par with the cost for one
year of IV treatment in Europe for 2018.

Today’s and future government revenues and costs for chronic Lyme disease are however much
more important to look at than historical annual cost. We will again treat the cure rate for IV antibiotics
for chronic Lyme disease as an unknown. We will calculate variables for five different scenarios: A cure
rate of 0%, a cure rate 25%, a cure rate of 50%, a cure rate of 75% and a cure rate of 100%. The number
of chronic Lyme patients that are cured with treatment/not cured with treatment and are working/not
working can be seen in Table 15.

Now we need to answer the important question: should a government pay for IV treatment for
chronic Lyme disease? From a purely economic and financial perspective which excludes any ethical
 Healthcare 2018, 6, 16

aspect of not offering antibiotics treatment to patients that suffer from a bacterial infection that can lead
to death a government should finance treatment with IV antibiotics for chronic Lyme disease if
Future government revenues [treatment] + future government cost [treatment] + treatment cost
> future government revenues [no treatment] + future government cost [no treatment]
where government revenues are positive values and government costs are negative values. Such
governments’ financial chronic Lyme disease balance sheet is presented in Table 16.

We now again assume that the annual growth rate of the infection is 2% per year, the annual
population growth rate in the USA is assumed to be 1% and the annual population growth rate in
Europe is assumed to be 0.2%. We assume that we treat all chronic Lyme patients with IV antibiotics
for either six months or one year and we again look at the value for different variables for five different
cure rates 0%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%. All charts in this section and more can be found in the Excel

We can see in Figure 20 that the US government’s financial balance based on future cost and revenues
for antibiotic IV treatment for 6 months for chronic Lyme disease GBFiv0.5 is positive for an assumed
cure rate of 25% and above and for 1 year of IV treatment GBFiv1 is also positive for an assumed cure
rate of 25% and above. We can see in Figure 21 that the European governments’ financial balance
based on today’s cost and revenues for antibiotic IV treatment for 6 months for chronic Lyme disease
GBTiv0.5 is positive for an assumed cure rate of 25% and above and for 1 year of IV treatment with
antibiotic GBTiv1 is positive for an assumed cure rate of 50% and above. We can see in Figure 22
that the European governments’ financial balance based on future cost and revenues for IV antibiotic
treatment for 6 months for chronic Lyme disease GBFiv0.5 is positive for an assumed cure rate of 25%
and above and for 1 year of IV antibiotic treatment GBFiv1 is also positive for an assumed cure rate
of 25% and above.

4. Discussion
Independent and objective peer review is a critical component for scientific publication because
of two main reasons. (1) It makes sure that only high-quality papers are published which is critical for
 Healthcare 2018, 6, 16
41 of 51
the credibility of a scientific journal and science in general. (2) It leads to decentralization of power
which is also critical for the credibility of a scientific journal and science in general. When the CDC
publishes its research on Lyme disease in a private special interest group’s “scientific” journal such
as Clinical Infectious Diseases which is issued by the IDSA the probability that the paper will receive
independent and objective peer review is close to zero. The Journal of Infectious Diseases, Clinical
Infectious Diseases and Open Forum Infectious Diseases are all “scientific” journals published by the IDSA.
Scientific publication is not democratic in a sense that everyone (including people without subject
knowledge) can vote and where the majority decides which papers are published. Such undemocratic
nature of science is a strength, but it can also sometimes be a weakness. Medicine is based on science,
but medicine also has patients. Patients are the only ones that will be affected by a physician’s decision.
It is therefore not unrealistic to expect that patients can influence decision making regarding their
diagnosis and treatment. Unfortunately, today medical doctors, journal editors that desk reject papers,
politicians, journalists and governments are experts when it comes to centralized decision-making.
It also appears that medicine and medical science today has become politicized where personal
and subjective opinions govern. Government health agencies have not done an objective review
of the scientific literature regarding chronic Lyme disease. There exist at least five reasons for this.
(1) Governments’ treatment guidelines or research on Lyme disease have not been published in high
quality international scientific journals which means that such publications have not been subject
to objective and independent peer review which is very unscientific. (2) Infectious disease doctors
(in the USA IDSA) and government health agencies (in the USA CDC) have previously or are possibly
still colluding and IDSA is colluding with insurance companies in the USA. (3) The treatment guideline
panels with doctors have not been sufficiently diversified because ILADS doctors have been excluded
from the decision making. (4) Chronic Lyme patients have been excluded from the treatment guideline
panels for Lyme disease. (5) Governments have a fear of antibiotic resistance even though there exists
no scientific evidence that the Borrelia bacteria have developed antibiotic resistance. Encouraging
physicians to do an independent and objective evaluation of the scientific literature is more important
than to force physicians to blindly follow government treatment guidelines that may or may not be
ethical and up to date. Doing scientific research and reading the scientific literature are demanding
work. Blindly following treatment guidelines requires little effort and does not require a degree in
medicine because you don’t need to be a professional chef to follow a cooking recipe. The importance
of a patient voice is also something that is missing in the debate. Doctors have a responsibility to help
sick patients. To deny a patient medical treatment in a situation when there exists scientific evidence to
support treatment will always be controversial. Infectious disease doctors need to be more modest
here. Patients have a critical role in healthcare and without them, there will be no healthcare. Some
people conclude that since oral antibiotics cannot cure chronic Lyme disease patients, oral antibiotics
should not be given to chronic Lyme patients. Such reasoning is a non-sequitur (logical fallacy). HIV is
a chronic infection that cannot be eradicated with oral medication, but HIV patients still receive oral
medication for life. Does there exist a general rule in medicine that states that only viral infections
can become chronic? No! Is it ethical to refuse a patient treatment that reduces a patient’s bacterial
load, reduces a patient’s symptoms and sometimes even cures them? No! Is it ethical to refuse a patient
treatment for an infection that can kill them without treatment? No!
There also exist at least two problems with studies that treat chronic Lyme disease patients with IV
antibiotics and conclude that such treatment did not eradicate the infection is (1) These studies usually
treat chronic Lyme patients with monotherapy which is not a recommended treatment. (2) They usually
do not treat for a sufficient period to make inference about how effective IV treatment is in eradicating
the infection. I also want to point out that a double-blind, randomized controlled trial where neither
the patient nor the treating doctor knows if the patient has received placebo or medication might,
in theory, sound like a good a way to determine how effective a certain medication is. Reality is
however far from theory. There also exists an ethical aspect. It is not ethical to give patients with a
confirmed infection placebo in the name of science when such action could result in a lifelong infection
 Healthcare 2018, 6, 16

for the patient. The estimated number of people that were infected with Lyme disease in the USA in
2008 is 829,600. If we assume that the incidence rate 2008 in the USA and Europe were the same, then
approximately 2 million people were infected with Lyme disease Europe in 2008. Given an annual
infection growth rate of 2% then in 2018 in the USA approximately 1 million people and in Europe
2.4 million will get infected with Lyme disease. Given an annual population growth of 1% in the USA
then by 2050 in the USA 56 million people (12% of the population in the USA in 2050) will have been
infected with Lyme disease. Given an annual population growth in Europe of 0.2% then by 2050 in
Europe 135 million people (17% of the population Europe in 2050) will have been infected with Lyme
disease. Most of these Lyme disease infections will, unfortunately, become chronic. I have also shown
in this article that the financial implications of chronic Lyme disease are vast. A financial cost not only
to patients but also to governments. Given that acute Lyme disease is treated with oral antibiotics
for one month and chronic Lyme is treated with IV antibiotics for either 6 months or 1 year, then
the estimated treatment cost for acute and chronic Lyme disease for 2018 for the USA is somewhere
between 4.8 billion USD and 9.6 billion USD and for Europe somewhere between 10.1 billion EUR and
20.1 billion EUR. The estimated lost personal income for chronic Lyme patients that are not working
for 2018 for the USA is 16.1 billion USD and in Europe 24.8 billion EUR. If the governments in the USA
and Europe do not finance IV treatment with antibiotics for chronic Lyme disease, then the estimated
government cost for chronic Lyme disease in the form of lost tax revenues because some chronic Lyme
patients are not working plus disability benefits for chronic Lyme patients that not working for 2018
for the USA is 10.1 billion USD and for Europe 20.1 billion EUR. The government cost for chronic Lyme
disease which does not include treatment costs for 2018 in the USA is 2.1 times larger than the cost
for 6 months of IV treatment with antibiotics in the USA in 2018 and 1.1 times larger than the cost
for 1 year of IV treatment with antibiotics in the USA in 2018. In Europe, the government cost for
chronic Lyme disease for 2018 is two times larger than the cost for six months of IV treatment with
antibiotics for Europe for 2018 and the government cost is on par with the cost, for one year of IV
with antibiotics treatment for Europe for 2018. The cost for the governments of having chronic Lyme
patients sick in perpetuity is very large. Future government revenues and future government costs
for chronic Lyme disease are however much more important to look at than historical annual cost.
Governments aggressive way to try to reduce antibiotic use unfortunately only creates more chronic
infections where people can be forced to take oral antibiotics for the rest of their lives which means
that the initial reduction in antibiotics use that can be observed due to the government’s aggressive
antibiotics reduction policy increases the use of antibiotics in the long run. No one thinks that diseases
that are caused by a virus should be treated with antibiotics but when people who need antibiotics for
their survival do not get access to them, then there is something wrong.
5. Conclusions
If someone acknowledges that acute Lyme disease is caused by bacteria, then they are also
forced by logical reasoning to acknowledge that chronic Lyme disease is caused by bacteria because
the immune system by itself can never eradicate a Borrelia infection and a bacterial infection does not
magically disappear without antibiotic treatment once a person has been infected. We have known for
a long time that antibiotics kill bacteria. However, sometimes oral and even IV antibiotics are unable
to eradicate a Borrelia infection, but those observations are irrelevant because HIV patients receive
treatment for life even though antiviral medications cannot eradicate an HIV infection and people
with chronic Lyme disease die without antibiotic treatment. One single death caused by chronic Lyme
disease is also enough to justify antibiotic treatment for chronic Lyme disease because a killer must
“only” kill one person to become a killer. When a private special interest group such as the IDSA
makes a political claim that three weeks of oral antibiotics is always enough to eradicate an acute or
chronic Lyme disease infection, then the burden of proof lies with the IDSA. The IDSA must show
the scientific evidence that supports their claim. I can claim that a red car is circulating the moon
but unless I can show the scientific evidence that supports my claim, my claim has little meaning.

Lyme disease and chronic Lyme disease are well-hidden pandemics because: (1) the tests for Lyme
disease are insensitive. Even if patients are “lucky” enough to test positive, patients will sometimes
not receive antibiotic treatment because then the infectious disease physicians (in the USA IDSA) claim
without scientific evidence that the antibodies are old and not a sign of an active infection. It becomes
impossible for a patient to win. (2) the IDSA and CDC have previously or are possibly still colluding.
(3) Because the cost of IV antibiotic treatment for chronic Lyme disease is so large insurance companies
in the USA collude with IDSA to make sure IDSA deny that chronic Lyme disease is real disease that is
caused by bacteria and require antibiotic treatment. This leads to that many Lyme disease patients are
denied treatment and left to suffer until the infection eventually kills them. For many chronic Lyme
disease patients, ILADS doctors, therefore, become heroes because these medical doctors are treating
extremely sick and abandoned patients with long-term antibiotics. The CDC reported that in 2008
in the USA 444,000 people (high scenario) were infected with Lyme disease. The CDC assumption,
without motivation or empirical evidence, that the number of healthy people in the control group is
4.4 times the number of infected people in the disease group for the high scenario is not realistic. If the
CDC had assumed that the size of the control group with healthy people was the same size as the
disease group with infected people (p = 1), then the number of Lyme disease infections in the USA for
2008 for the CDC high scenario would have been 527,288 instead of 444,000 given a Lyme disease test
sensitivity of 0.669 and specificity of 0.961. If we assume a 1 to 1 relationship between the two groups
and a Lyme disease test sensitivity of 0.44 and a Lyme disease test specificity of 0.99, then we get
829,600 infections in the USA in 2008. Because there exists uncertainty if the CDC is independent and
objective, there also exists uncertainty about the CDC ability to protect public health. This research
paper is one of the first studies that have estimated the financial cost of chronic Lyme disease both for
individuals and governments. This research paper is also the first paper that can show that if the USA
and European governments want to minimize future cost and maximize future revenues, then they
should pay for IV treatment with antibiotics for chronic Lyme disease up to a year even if the estimated
cure rate is as low as 25%. I am convinced that the history books in the future will describe controversy
that exists today regarding chronic Lyme disease as one of the most shameful affairs in medicine.
