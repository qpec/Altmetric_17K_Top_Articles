SUMMARY
Mutations truncating a single copy of the tumor
suppressor, BRCA2, cause cancer susceptibility. In
cells bearing such heterozygous mutations, we find
that a cellular metabolite and ubiquitous environ-
mental toxin, formaldehyde, stalls and destabilizes
DNA replication forks, engendering structural chro-
mosomal
aberrations.
Formaldehyde
selectively
depletes BRCA2 via proteasomal degradation, a
mechanism of toxicity that affects very few addi-
tional cellular proteins. Heterozygous BRCA2 trunca-
tions, by lowering pre-existing BRCA2 expression,
sensitize
to
BRCA2
haploinsufficiency
induced
by transient exposure to natural concentrations of
formaldehyde. Acetaldehyde, an alcohol catabolite
detoxified by ALDH2, precipitates similar effects.
Ribonuclease H1 ameliorates replication fork insta-
bility and chromosomal aberrations provoked by
aldehyde-induced BRCA2 haploinsufficiency, sug-
gesting that BRCA2 inactivation triggers sponta-
neous
mutagenesis
during
DNA
replication
via
aberrant RNA-DNA hybrids (R-loops). These findings
suggest a model wherein carcinogenesis in BRCA2
mutation carriers can be incited by compounds
found pervasively in the environment and generated
endogenously in certain tissues with implications for
public health.
INTRODUCTION
Inherited germline mutations affecting a single copy of the
BRCA2 tumor suppressor gene predispose to cancers of the
breast, ovaries, pancreas, prostate, and other organs (Breast
Cancer Linkage Consortium, 1999). Human BRCA2 encodes a
nuclear-localized protein of 3,418 residues, which is essential
for the maintenance of chromosome integrity, through functions
in homology-directed DNA repair, in stabilizing stalled DNA repli-
cation forks, or in mitotic cell division (reviewed in Venkitaraman,
2014). Aberrations in chromosome structure and increased
sensitivity to genotoxic agents typically occur after bi-allelic
BRCA2 disruption in murine or human cells, rather than with mu-
tations affecting a single allele (Connor et al., 1997; Patel et al.,
1998; Skoulidis et al., 2010). Organ development and function
is grossly normal in genetically engineered mice heterozygous
for mutant BRCA2 alleles (Connor et al., 1997; Friedman et al.,
1998; Ludwig et al., 1997; Sharan et al., 1997; Suzuki et al.,
1997), as is homology-directed DNA repair in multiple tissues
(Kass et al., 2016). What promotes carcinogenesis in carriers
of heterozygous BRCA2 mutations is therefore unclear.
Inherited missense mutations in BRCA2 may act dominantly
to suppress the wild-type allele (Jeyasekharan et al., 2013). How-
ever, the most prevalent BRCA2 alleles that confer a clinically
significant risk of cancer susceptibility encode nonsense or
frameshift mutations, which prematurely truncate the BRCA2
protein (Rebbeck et al., 2015) (Breast Cancer Information Core
[BIC] database, https://research.nhgri.nih.gov/bic/). These trun-
cating mutations include the 6174delT mutation prevalent among
the Ashkenazim (Neuhausen et al., 1996), the pathogenic trunca-
tion 3036del4 (BIC database) representative of variants asso-
ciated with breast and ovarian cancer, or carboxyl (C)-terminal
truncating mutations like 7691insAT or 9900insA implicated in
Fanconi anemia (Howlett et al., 2002). We have investigated the
mechanism by which heterozygosity for such BRCA2 truncating
mutations may promote carcinogenesis.
Here, we report that exposure to naturally occurring concen-
trations of formaldehyde or acetaldehyde selectively unmasks
genomic instability in cells heterozygous for multiple, clinically
relevant, truncating BRCA2 mutations. These agents are not
only widespread in our environment, but also accumulate
endogenously in certain tissues via critical metabolic reactions
such as oxidative demethylation or alcohol catabolism (Harris
et al., 2003; Roy and Bhagwat, 2007; Shi et al., 2004). Alde-
hydes selectively deplete BRCA2 via proteasomal degradation,
rendering BRCA2 heterozygous cells vulnerable to induced
BRCA2 haploinsufficiency. Induced BRCA2 haploinsufficiency
provokes chromosomal aberrations through DNA replication
fork stalling and the MRE11-dependent degradation of nascent
DNA, via the unscheduled formation of RNA-DNA hybrids. These

 previously unrecognized cellular effects of aldehydes may
potentiate genome instability and promote tissue-specific can-
cer evolution in patients who inherit pathogenic BRCA2 trunca-
tions, with implications for cancer biology and public health.
RESULTS
Formaldehyde Stalls DNA Replication and Triggers
Strand Breakage
Formaldehyde, a widespread environmental toxin, occurs at
50–100 mM in human blood (Heck et al., 1985; Luo et al., 2001)
and reacts readily with both proteins and DNA to generate ad-
ducts and cross-linkages (Huang et al., 1992; Lu et al., 2010; Sol-
omon and Varshavsky, 1985) expected to impede DNA transac-
tions in the cell nucleus. Mice doubly deficient in the Fanconi
anemia protein FANCD2 and in the formaldehyde-catabolizing
enzyme ADH5 sustain DNA damage and retarded growth (Pontel
et al., 2015). To characterize the effect of formaldehyde on DNA

formaldehyde for 2 hr were labeled with

sure DNA synthesis and co-stained for

when
exposed
to 100 mM or 300 mM formaldehyde
(Figure 1A). DNA fiber analysis after pulse
labeling
with
5-iodo-20-deoxyuridine
(IdU) and then 5-chloro-20-deoxyuridine
(CldU) shows that formaldehyde signifi-
cantly increases the asymmetry of sister
replication fork tracts emanating from
the same origin of replication (Figure 1B), a consistent marker
of replication fork stalling (Schwab et al., 2015), from a median
ratio of 1.18 in untreated (UT) cells to 1.87 following formalde-
hyde (FA) treatment (p < 0.001, Mann-Whitney t test). Formalde-
hyde also increases staining for gH2AX (Figure 1C), a marker of
DNA breakage. Notably, gH2AX foci accumulate prominently in
PCNA-positive cells (Figure 1D), suggesting that formaldehyde
selectively causes DNA damage during DNA replication. The
DNA synthesis inhibitor, hydroxyurea (HU), elicits similar effects
(Figures 1C and 1D). Thus, formaldehyde stalls DNA replication
and triggers strand breakage in dividing cells.
Heterozygous BRCA2 Truncations Sensitize Selectively
to Formaldehyde-Induced Replication Stress
From the HeLa Kyoto cell line (that is diploid for BRCA2) (Adey
et al., 2013), we created cells heterozygous for the clinically rele-
vant BRCA2 truncating mutations 6174delT and 3036del4 using
CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome engineering (Ran et al., 2013).
1106
Cell 169, 1105–1118, June 1, 2017
 While 6174delT encodes a frameshift mutation leading to a pre-
mature stop codon at amino acid 2002, the 3036del4 frameshift
mutation similarly truncates the BRCA2 protein at amino acid
958 (Figure 2A). Both mutations cause cancer predisposition in
humans (Ramus and Gayther, 2009).
Heterozygosity for the 6174delT or 3036del4 mutations low-
ered wild-type BRCA2 protein expression to 40%–60% of that
in parental cells, although the truncated proteins were undetect-
able (Figure 2B). The proliferation of the heterozygous cell lines
was indistinguishable from the parental cells (Figure S1A), and
there was no significant change (Figure S1B) in the formation
of RAD51 foci at sites of DNA damage after 5 Gy ionizing
radiation (IR), a key surrogate marker for BRCA2’s functions in
homologous DNA recombination (Yuan et al., 1999) and replica-
tion fork stabilization (Petermann et al., 2010; Schlacher et al.,
2011). Our findings are in accord with previous reports in which
BRCA2 heterozygosity impairs neither cell proliferation nor the
control of RAD51.
Bi-allelic
BRCA2
inactivation
causes
cellular
sensitivity
to replication stress provoked by HU, accompanied by the
destabilization of DNA replication forks (Lomonosov et al.,
2003; Schlacher et al., 2011). By contrast, haploinsufficiency
for the related cancer suppressor, BRCA1, suffices to cause de-
fects in stalled replication fork repair or integrity following HU
exposure (Pathania et al., 2014). We therefore compared the
effects of HU with formaldehyde in BRCA2 heterozygous cells
using the DNA fiber assay to measure IdU-labeled tract length.
Without treatment, the median length of IdU-labeled replica-
tion tracts in BRCA2 6174delT or 3036del4 heterozygous cells
was similar to that in parental cells (Figures 2C and 2F), confirm-
ing BRCA2 heterozygosity does not affect processive DNA repli-
cation. There was also no significant change after HU exposure
(Figures 2D and 2G). By contrast, formaldehyde treatment at
100 mM significantly shortened IdU-labeled replication tracts in
cells heterozygous for BRCA2 6174delT or 3036del4 compared
to the parental cells (Figures 2E and 2H).
Exposure to as little as 80 mM formaldehyde (Figures S1C–
S1E) for no more than 3 hr (Figures S1F and S1G) provokes repli-
cation tract shortening in BRCA2 6174delT or 3036del4 hetero-
zygous cells, but not parental controls. Similar anomalies occur
in immortalized human breast epithelial cells (HBECs) from pa-
tients heterozygous for the pathogenic BRCA2999del5 truncation
(Rubner Fridriksdottir et al., 2005), in contrast to wild-type
controls (Figures 2I–2K). Thus, transient exposure to naturally
occurring formaldehyde concentrations selectively provokes
DNA replication fork instability in BRCA2 heterozygous cells
derived from a target tissue for carcinogenesis in mutation car-
riers but not in wild-type controls, speaking to the physiological
relevance of our findings.
In contrast to BRCA2 heterozygosity, depletion of BRCA2
from HeLa Kyoto parental cells with short interfering RNA
(siRNA) (Figure S2A) destabilizes DNA replication forks stalled
by exposure either to HU or to formaldehyde (Figures S2B–
S2D). Similar experiments using the BRCA2-deficient cell line,
EUFA423 (that harbors inactivating bi-allelic mutations that trun-
cate one BRCA2 allele at exon 15 [7691insAT] and the second, at
exon 27 [9900insA]) (Howlett et al., 2002), or control EUFA423
cells stably reconstituted (Figure S2E) with full-length FLAG
epitope-tagged BRCA2 (Hattori et al., 2011; Jeyasekharan
et al., 2013), yielded similar results (Figures S2F–S2H). These
findings, with prior reports (Lomonosov et al., 2003; Schlacher
et al., 2011; Ying et al., 2012), confirm that BRCA2 is dispensable
for processive DNA replication but essential to preserve the
stability of stalled DNA replication forks, both after exposure to
HU as well as formaldehyde.
Formaldehyde Exposes Stalled DNA Replication Forks
in BRCA2 Heterozygous Cells to MRE11-Dependent
Strand Degradation
BRCA2 protects nascent DNA strands at stalled DNA replication
forks from degradation by the endonuclease, MRE11 (Schlacher
et al., 2011; Ying et al., 2012). Mirin (Dupre
´ et al., 2008), a selec-
tive small-molecule inhibitor of MRE11, but not its vehicle,
DMSO, significantly inhibits the degradation of IdU-labeled
replication tracts after formaldehyde treatment in BRCA2
3036del4 (Figure 2L) or 6174delT (Figure 2M) heterozygous cells.
This suggests that formaldehyde exposes stalled DNA replica-
tion forks in BRCA2 heterozygous cells to MRE11-dependent
strand degradation.
Selective Proteasomal Degradation of BRCA2 Protein
after Formaldehyde Exposure
Surprisingly, formaldehyde consistently causes dose-dependent
BRCA2 protein depletion over a 5 hr period in cells that are wild-
type for BRCA2, whereas HU does not (Figures 3A and 3B). This
effect is transient (Figure S3A), persisting for 8–12 hr after expo-
sure and is not cell-type-specific, as it also occurs in other cell
lines of varied origin that are wild-type for BRCA2 (Figure S3B).
Neither HU nor a panel of other genotoxic agents (camptothecin
[CPT], mitomycin C [MMC], ultraviolet light, ionizing radiation [IR],
5-azacytidine [5-Aza]) cause BRCA2 depletion in BRCA2 wild-
type cells even after extended exposure for up to 24 hr (Figure 3C)
despite robust activation of the DNA damage response marked
by increased phosphorylation of Ser 1981 in ataxia-telangiecta-
sia-mutated (ATM) kinase and Thr 1989 in ATM-related (ATR)
kinase. Thus, we unexpectedly find that formaldehyde depletes
BRCA2 protein from many cell types that are wild-type for
BRCA2, an effect not triggered by other genotoxins.
A pulse-chase assay using the protein synthesis inhibitor
cycloheximide in BRCA2 wild-type cells shows that 300 mM
formaldehyde shortens the half-life of BRCA2 protein from
4.5 hr ± 1.7 to 2.3 hr ± 0.4 (Figure 3D). While three different inhib-
itors of the 20S proteasome (Kisselev et al., 2006)—velcade, ep-
oxomicin, and MG132—substantially restored BRCA2 protein
levels in formaldehyde-treated cells (Figure 3E), the lysosome in-
hibitor chloroquine (Solomon and Lee, 2009) did not. The deubi-
quitinase inhibitor, b-AP15 (that potently inhibits the recognition
of polyubiquitinated substrates by the 19S proteasome) also fails
to protect BRCA2 protein (Figure 3E), despite permitting the
accumulation of many polyubiquitinated species. Several re-
ports indicate that b-AP15 spares proteolysis by the 20S core
proteasome (Chitta et al., 2015; Tian et al., 2014), but there is
also evidence otherwise (Huang et al., 2014), precluding a
definitive conclusion regarding the role of ubiquitination in the
formaldehyde-induced proteasomal degradation of wild-type
BRCA2 protein.

 BRCA2 protein largely populates the nuclear-soluble fraction
of cell extracts and is also detected in the chromatin-bound
and cytosolic fractions (Figure S3C). Formaldehyde-induced
BRCA2 degradation affects all three fractions, suggesting that
the underlying mechanism operates in them all.
Formaldehyde Selectively Depletes Components of the
Cellular Proteome
Formaldehyde-induced degradation affects relatively few pro-
teins encoded in the human proteome. Proteins other than
BRCA2 implicated in homologous recombination or the Fanconi
anemia repair pathway, like BRCA1, RAD51, PALB2, XRCC3,
FANCI, or FANCD2, were at most modestly affected (Figure 4A),
as were non-homologous end joining proteins like KU80, KU70,
and XRCC4 (Figure 4B).
The selectivity of protein depletion triggered by formalde-
hyde is evident in proteome-wide analyses using sequential
window acquisition of all theoretical spectra-mass spectrometry
(SWATH-MS), which quantifies protein abundance at high
throughput and resolution (Gillet et al., 2012). In ten biological
replicates per sample from HeLa Kyoto cells treated with or
without 200 mM formaldehyde for 5 hr, we detected >50,000
peptides from all samples and analyzed only peptides detected
in at least eight out of ten replicates in both conditions. The abun-
dance of 4,219 proteins could be calculated by summating
the peptide intensities of the three most abundant peptides for
each protein. Analysis of fold-changes in protein expression
and the associated Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p values
(Table S1) reveals that <1% of the detected proteins (35/4,219)
showed statistically significant reductions (p < 0.05, Benjamini-
Hochberg adjusted) of more than 25% following formaldehyde
exposure (Figure 4C; Table S2). Examples of the 35 depleted
proteins (e.g., TXNL1 and JAK1) were robustly depleted by form-
aldehyde in western blotting, in contrast to proteins (e.g., PLK1
and AURKB) shown by SWATH-MS to exhibit little change
in abundance, confirming complementarity between the two
detection methods (Figure 4D). In addition, the number of pro-
teins with coefficient of variation (CV) <25% was similar across
all (treated and untreated) samples (Figure S4A). By contrast,
for all of the 35 proteins affected by formaldehyde, peptide inten-
sities were significantly and consistently decreased in at least
eight out of ten biological replicates (nine representative exam-
ples plotted in Figure S4B). Thus, formaldehyde selectively
reduces the abundance of a few additional proteins besides
BRCA2, a previously unrecognized effect that may be salient
to its role as a ubiquitous environmental toxin. However, fea-
tures common to the proteins apparently targeted by formalde-
hyde are not yet evident, obscuring immediate insights into
mechanism.
Formaldehyde Induces Haploinsufficiency in BRCA2
Heterozygous Cells, Causing Replication Stress
We next tested the effects of formaldehyde exposure on BRCA2
protein levels in BRCA2 heterozygous cells, in which expression
is already lowered to �50% of that in wild-type parental cells
(Figure 2B). After exposure to 100 mM formaldehyde exposure
for 5 hr, BRCA2 expression in parental cells decreased to
�55% of the baseline value, approximately a 2-fold reduction.
However, a similar 2-fold reduction induced by formaldehyde
in cells heterozygous for the BRCA2 6174delT or 3036del4
mutations further diminished expression to �20% of wild-type
levels (Figure 5A). In contrast, HU exposure had a minimal
effect in all conditions. HBECs heterozygous for BRCA2999del5
responded similarly (Figure S5A).
Could formaldehyde exposure lead to ‘‘induced haploinsuffi-
ciency’’ for BRCA2 protein in settings where its expression
is already lowered by heterozygous mutations, by reducing
BRCA2 levels to a degree that compromises function? We com-
plemented BRCA2 6174delT or 3036del4 heterozygous cells
by stably expressing a construct encoding full-length FLAG
epitope-tagged BRCA2 to restore wild-type levels of BRCA2
protein (Figures 5B and 5C). BRCA2 complementation sufficed
to counteract formaldehyde-induced shortening of IdU-labeled
replication tracts (Figures 5D and 5E). These results validate
that formaldehyde indeed triggers ‘‘induced haploinsufficiency’’
for BRCA2 in cells bearing heterozygous mutations, and replica-
tion stress arises from the depletion of BRCA2 and not other
proteins.
Conversely, we partially depleted BRCA2 protein from HeLa
Kyoto parental cells using calibrated doses of siRNA before
analyzing formaldehyde-induced replication stress (Figure S5B).
Treatment with 10 nM versus 25 nM of siRNA progressively re-
duces BRCA2 protein expression from �35% to �6% of base-
line levels in untreated cells (Figure S5C). When combined with
100 mM formaldehyde for 5 hr, BRCA2 levels are sharply further
reduced by �3- to 6-fold, such that 10 nM of siRNA with formal-
dehyde reduces expression to �13% of baseline levels, and
25 nM of siRNA with formaldehyde reduces expression to
�1% of baseline levels. In contrast, 4 mM HU combined with
different doses of siRNA has little effect over siRNA alone.

 BRCA2 depletion (from 35% to 6% of baseline levels) using
siRNA alone had little effect on processive DNA replication in un-
treated cells (Figure S5D). BRCA2 depletion to 55% of baseline
levels using 10 nM siRNA (mimicking BRCA2 heterozygosity)
did not alter the length of IdU-labeled replication tracts after
replication stalling provoked by HU, whereas depletion to 4%
of baseline levels using 25 nM siRNA (mimicking bi-allelic
BRCA2 inactivation) caused a marked degradation of the tracts
(Figure S5E). In contrast, the combined effect of formaldehyde
plus 10 nM or 25 nM siRNA reduced BRCA2 expression to
13% and 1% of baseline levels, respectively, triggering signifi-
cant shortening of IdU-labeled replication tract length in both
conditions (Figure S5F). Our findings provide additional evidence
to support the idea that BRCA2 haploinsufficiency potentiates
formaldehyde-induced
replication
stress,
suggesting
that

 mutations in BRCA2 thus far detected in humans may have
similar consequences.
In multiple experiments using different cell types, replication
stress is not detected when cells wild-type for BRCA2 are
exposed to 80–100 mM formaldehyde for 3–5 hr, although it is
evident in similarly treated BRCA2 heterozygous cells (Figures
2E, 2H, 2I–2M, and S1C–S1H). Indeed, formaldehyde exposure
in BRCA2 wild-type cells reduces BRCA2 protein to �50%
of pre-existing levels (Figure 3A, 5A, and S3A), consistent with
the absence of replication stress. However, prolonged or
high-dose formaldehyde treatment enhances BRCA2 protein
depletion even in wild-type cells (Figure S5G), concomitantly
precipitating replication tract instability (Figures S5H and S5I).
This previously unrecognized mechanism may contribute to
the genotoxicity of formaldehyde.
Formaldehyde Triggers Structural Chromosome
Aberrations in BRCA2 Heterozygous Cells
Replication forkstallingand instabilityhave beenlinked tothe gen-
esis of chromosomal lesions through mechanisms that remain un-
certain (Schlacher et al., 2011). Untreated cells heterozygous for
the BRCA2 6174delT or 3036del4 mutations exhibit a low average
frequency of structural chromosome aberrations equating to 0.02
± 0.01 and 0.04 ± 0.02 per metaphase, respectively, similar to that
observed in wild-type parental controls (0.02 ± 0.01 aberrations
per metaphase) and consistent with previous findings (Patel
et al., 1998). Strikingly, after treatment with formaldehyde, the
average frequency of structural chromosomal aberrations per
metaphase
increased
markedly—by
over
30-
to
40-fold
(+/6174delT, 0.02 ± 0.01 to 0.93 ± 0.13; +/3036del4, 0.04 ± 0.02
to 1.30 ± 0.18)—in BRCA2 heterozygous cells (Figures 6A and
6B). Similar results are observed using BRCA2999del5 HBECs (Fig-
ure S6A). Aberrations include Y-shaped tri-radial and star-shaped
quadri-radial structures pathognomonic of defects in mitotic
recombination that are characteristic of BRCA2-deficient cells
(Patel et al., 1998; Yu et al., 2000). In contrast, the average fre-
quency of chromosomal aberrations in parental cells exposed to
formaldehyde did not change significantly (Figures 6A and 6B).
Moreover, treatment with HU enhanced equally the frequency of
chromosomal aberrations in both wild-type and BRCA2 hetero-
zygous cells. Complementation with full-length FLAG epitope-
tagged BRCA2 of cells heterozygous for either the BRCA2
6174delT or 3036del4 mutations significantly reduced formalde-
hyde-induced chromosomal aberrations (Figure 6C), confirming
that BRCA2 haploinsufficiency accounts for this effect.
The MRE11 inhibitor, Mirin, reverses replication tract degrada-
tion triggered by formaldehyde in BRCA2 heterozygous cells
(Figures 2L and 2M). Mirin also significantly ameliorates the fre-
quency of structural chromosomal aberrations in formaldehyde-
treated BRCA2 heterozygous cells (+/6174delT, 1.11 ± 0.18 to
0.44 ± 0.12; +/3036del4, 2.77 ± 0.38 to 0.80 ± 0.22) (Figure 6D),
suggesting that nascent DNA resection at stalled replication
forks contributes to chromosomal instability.
Formaldehyde-induced DNA replication stress and chromo-
somal aberrations in BRCA2 heterozygous cells do not greatly
impair clonogenic survival (Figure 6E). Formaldehyde exposure
at 100 mM formaldehyde for 5 hr modestly reduced colony for-
mation, as expected, but did so likewise in BRCA2 heterozygous
and wild-type parental cells. Similar results were observed using
BRCA2999del5 HBECs (Figure S6B).
Ribonuclease H1 Ameliorates Formaldehyde-Induced
Replication Stress and Genome Damage
RNA-DNA hybrids (R-loops) are normal intermediates in DNA
transactions such as transcription termination, but their un-
scheduled formation may trigger genomic instability (Hatchi
et al., 2015; Huertas and Aguilera, 2003). Interestingly, unsched-
uled R-loops accumulate after bi-allelic inactivation of BRCA2
(Bhatia et al., 2014) and may contribute to replication stress in
cells that lack FANCD2 or FANCA (Garcı
´a-Rubio et al., 2015;

 Schwab et al., 2015). To test whether R-loops mediate formalde-
hyde-induced replication stress and genome damage, we used
ribonuclease (RNase) H1, whose overexpression efficiently dis-
solves R-loops (Cerritelli and Crouch, 2009) and has previously
been deployed to test their involvement in cellular processes
(Bhatia et al., 2014; Schwab et al., 2015).

 Strikingly, there is a marked decrease in the ratio of sister
fork tract lengths in formaldehyde-exposed cells expressing
an mCherry fluorophore-tagged form of RNase H1, but not
mCherry alone (Figure 7A), suggesting that R-loops signif-
icantly contribute to formaldehyde-induced replication stalling
in parental as well as BRCA2 heterozygous cells. BRCA2
6174delT or 3036del4 heterozygous cells exhibit—even when
untreated—a modest elevation in the ratio of sister fork tract
lengths that is reduced by overexpression of mCherry-RNase

in BRCA2 heterozygous mutation carriers, alde-
hyde-induced
degradation
decreases
BRCA2
levels below the threshold of adequacy, engen-
dering ‘‘induced haploinsufficiency.’’ These events
expose stalled DNA replication forks to MRE11
activity, engendering chromosomal aberrations via
R-loop formation.

H1, but not mCherry alone (Figure 7A).
We infer that BRCA2 heterozygous cells
experience increased levels of replica-
tion fork stalling due to R-loops even
during unperturbed replication in cul-
ture, although this defect does not per
se augment chromosomal aberrations
(Figures 6A and 6B). Furthermore, tran-
scription
inhibition
by
5,6-dichloro-
1-b-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB)
(Figures S7A–S7C) or the overexpression
of
mCherry-RNase
H1—but
neither
mCherry alone nor the inactive Asp145Asn (D145N) mutant of
mCherry-RNase H1 (compare Figures 7B–7D)—also reduce
replication tract shortening in formaldehyde-treated BRCA2 het-
erozygous
cells.
Moreover,
formaldehyde-induced
BRCA2
degradation persists despite mCherry-RNase H1 overexpres-
sion (Figure S7D), suggesting it is a cause, not the consequence,
of excessive R-loops. Thus, multiple lines of evidence implicate
unscheduled R-loop formation in the genesis of formaldehyde-
induced replication stress in BRCA2 heterozygous cells.

Cell 169, 1105–1118, June 1, 2017
 Remarkably, overexpression of mCherry-RNase H1, but not
mCherry alone, significantly decreases the frequency of struc-
tural chromosomal aberrations in BRCA2 heterozygous cells
after formaldehyde exposure to levels comparable to wild-type
parental cells (Figure 7E). Thus, remarkably, our data suggest
that R-loop formation not only underlies formaldehyde-induced
replication fork stalling but also instigates genomic instability in
BRCA2 heterozygous cells.
Acetaldehyde-Induced Replication Tract Shortening in
BRCA2 Heterozygous Cells
Acetaldehyde, an endogenous product of ethanol catabolism,
is detoxified by ALDH2, whose activity is lost in >500 million
people worldwide through an inherited, trans-dominant muta-
tion, ALDH2E487K, prevalent in individuals of East Asian descent
(Yoshida et al., 1984). Carriers of this mutation typically exhibit
adverse reactions to alcohol consumption, due to the build-up
of acetaldehyde. Interestingly, transient exposure to acetalde-
hyde induces BRCA2 protein degradation in a dose-dependent
manner (Figure S7E), and DNA fiber analysis confirms that IdU-
labeled replication tracts are significantly shortened in BRCA2
6174delT or 3036del4 heterozygous, but not parental cells after
treatment with 3–4 mM acetaldehyde for 5 hr (Figures S7F–S7H).
These findings suggest that the mechanism of ‘‘induced BRCA2
haploinsufficiency’’ may be common to different aldehydes.
DISCUSSION
We report here that naturally occurring concentrations of formal-
dehyde, a product of cellular metabolism and a ubiquitous
environmental toxin, provoke replication fork instability and
structural chromosomal aberrations in cells heterozygous for
multiple, pathogenic truncating mutations affecting the BRCA2
tumor suppressor. These anomalies arise from a previously un-
recognized
effect
of
formaldehyde
to
selectively
deplete
BRCA2 via proteasomal degradation. Settings where BRCA2
expression is already compromised by heterozygous truncating
mutations potentiate vulnerability to formaldehyde-induced hap-
loinsufficiency for this tumor suppressor protein. Similar effects
occur with acetaldehyde, a product of ethanol catabolism. We
propose a model (Figure 7F) wherein aldehyde exposure poten-
tiates the carcinogenic potential of germline truncating muta-
tions affecting a single allele of BRCA2. Our findings have several
implications.
Mechanism of Formaldehyde-Induced Chromosomal
Instability in BRCA2 Heterozygous Cells
We provide a first line of evidence that replication fork degrada-
tion by MRE11 contributes to chromosomal instability (Figures
2L, 2M, and 6D). MRE11 inhibitors significantly reduce structural
chromosomal aberrations induced by formaldehyde in BRCA2
6174delT or 3036del4 heterozygous cells, suggesting that two
different effects of formaldehyde—DNA replication fork stalling
(Figures 1B, 2, and S2) plus induced haploinsufficiency for
BRCA2
(Figure
5)—collude
to
precipitate
chromosomal
instability.
We reveal a previously unrecognized link between unsched-
uled RNA-DNA hybrid formation and formaldehyde-induced
chromosomal instability in BRCA2 heterozygous cells. Overex-
pression of RNase H1, an enzyme that resolves R-loops, amelio-
rates formaldehyde-induced replication fork instability (Figures
7B–7D) and chromosomal aberrations (Figure 7E) in BRCA2 het-
erozygous cells. Notably, RNase H1 mitigates chromosomal ab-
errations thought typical of defective mitotic recombination,
and thus currently accepted models attributing chromosomal
instability solely to defective homologous DNA recombination
will need to be extended.
Selective Proteome Depletion Induced by Formaldehyde
Unexpectedly, formaldehyde selectively depletes the cellular
proteome, an effect that is neither cell-type-specific nor induced
by several other forms of DNA damage (Figures 3C and S3B).
Besides BRCA2, only �35 of >4,200 proteins detected by
SWATH-MS are selectively depleted. The mechanism(s) under-
lying the selectivity of formaldehyde-induced proteome deple-
tion remain unclear and warrant further study. However, this first
systematic analysis of the effect of formaldehyde on proteome
expression identifies changes that may be linked in future
studies to the toxicity of this ubiquitous, reactive compound.
Implications for Carcinogenesis and Public Health
Our findings suggest a new model (Figure 7F) for carcinogenesis
in individuals who carry germline mutations truncating a single
copy of BRCA2. Exposure to aldehydes like formaldehyde or
acetaldehyde, which are both widespread in our environment
and also accumulate endogenously in certain tissues, could
potentiate spontaneous mutagenesis in the cells of mutation car-
riers, predisposing to cancer. In this model, the risk of carcino-
genesis among mutation carriers may depend not only on the
nature of their germline BRCA2 mutation and its susceptibility
to aldehyde-induced haploinsufficiency but also upon other
genetic and environmental factors that determine exposure to al-
dehydes. Because BRCA2 mutation carriers typically develop
cancers in certain epithelial tissues including the breast, ovary,
pancreas, or prostate, we speculate that organ-specific differ-
ences in endogenous aldehyde accumulation or extrinsic expo-
sure may account in part for the observed tissue selectivity.
Notably, our proposal suggests that—rather than being pro-
moted solely by intrinsic cellular defects—cancer evolution
among carriers of at least certain types of BRCA2 mutations
may instead be driven by a gene-environment interaction, in
which a category of pervasive, naturally occurring compounds
trigger ‘‘induced haploinsufficiency.’’
Even in wild-type cells, prolonged or high-dose formaldehyde
exposure can deplete BRCA2 protein to levels low enough
to induce replication stress (Figures S5G–S5I). Thus, although
BRCA2 heterozygous cells are particularly vulnerable to alde-
hyde-induced haploinsufficiency, wild-type cells are not imper-
vious, suggesting a mechanism for the carcinogenic potential
of formaldehyde exposure in otherwise normal individuals.
The public health significance of our findings is emphasized by
the ubiquity of exposure to formaldehyde and acetaldehyde,
particularly in the urban environment, from sources including to-
bacco smoke, e-cigarettes, automobile combustion emissions,
building materials, and even cosmetics (IARC, 2006). Over 500
million individuals worldwide, particularly of East Asian descent,
Cell 169, 1105–1118, June 1, 2017
1115
 carry the trans-dominant ALDH2E487K polymorphic variant,
which vastly reduces enzymatic activity for acetaldehyde catab-
olism leading to increased acetaldehyde build-up after alcohol
consumption (Jin et al., 2015). Epidemiological studies seem
warranted to investigate the risk of cancer associated with
BRCA2 mutations in such populations, particularly in light of
the difficulty in testing these hypotheses in genetically engi-
neered pre-clinical mouse models. Conversely, it is tempting to
speculate that dietary supplementation with formaldehyde scav-
engers like Resveratrol (Marcsek et al., 2007) may offer a future
strategy to reduce cancer incidence in patients who carry path-
ogenic truncating mutations affecting BRCA2.

 METHOD DETAILS
EdU and EU Incorporation
For EdU labeling, cells were labeled with 10 mM EdU for 1h and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. For
EU labeling, cells were labeled with 1mM EU for 1h and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. See the
‘Immunofluorescence’ section for immunostaining procedures.
Immunofluorescence
For detection of chromatin-bound PCNA, cells grown on coverslips were pre-extracted with CSK buffer (25mM HEPES, pH 7.4,
50mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA, 3mM MgCl2, 300mM sucrose, 0.5% Triton X-100) for 5 min on ice, washed twice in 1x PBS and fixed in
4% paraformaldehyde solution for 10 min at 25�C. For EdU detection, we used the Click-iT reaction cocktail (Click-iT EdU Alexa Fluor
488 Imaging Kit, ThermoFisher, C10086) and applied onto samples for 30 min at room temperature, protected from light. After
washing twice with 1X PBS, samples were blocked with 2% BSA, 0.1% Triton X-100/1X TBS solution for 30min and incubated
with primary antibodies at 25�C for 2h (anti-gH2AX (Millipore #05–636, 1:2000), anti-PCNA, Abcam ab18197, 1:1000, anti-RAD51
(Abnova #H00005888-B01P, 1:2000)). Cells were washed thrice in 0.1% Triton X-100/1X TBS solution and incubated with appro-
priate secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa fluorophores (Molecular Probes, 1:500) for 1h at 25�C. After three washes in
0.1% Triton X-100/1X TBS, slides were mounted with Vectashield containing 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and imaged using
a Leica SP5 confocal microscope using 40x or 63x objective lenses.
For EU detection, fixed cells were washed twice with 1X PBS. After permeabilization with 0.5% Triton X-100/1X PBS for 20min at
room temperature, the Click-iT reaction cocktail (Click-iT RNA Alexa Fluor 594 Imaging Kit, ThermoFisher C10330) was applied to
samples for 30min at room temperature protected from light. After washing twice in 1X PBS, samples were mounted with Vectashield
containing DAPI and imaged using a Leica SP5 confocal microscope using a 63x objective lens. See the ‘Image acquisition and
analysis’ section for details.
DNA Fiber Assay
For sister fork asymmetry assays, cells were labeled with IdU (25 mM) for 10min and subsequently with CIdU (250 mM) with or without
formaldehyde for 20min. For replication fork stability assays, cells were labeled with IdU (25 mM) for 20min prior to incubation for 5h in
respective treatments. Cells were spotted onto glass slides and lysed (200mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50mM EDTA, 0.5% SDS). DNA was
combed by tilting of slides, air-dried and fixed in Carnoy’s fixative (10min, 25�C). Slides were dried and denatured in 2.5M HCl for 1h
before washing 3x in ice-cold 1X PBS. Slides were blocked in 1.5% blocking solution (Roche, 11096176001, 0.05% Tween, 1X PBS,
pH 7.4) for 30min at 37�C or overnight at 4�C. To detect CIdU, slides were incubated (45min, 25�C) with rat anti-BrdU (ab6326, 1:750)
before incubated in stringency buffer (10mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 400mM NaCl, 0.2% Tween, 0.2% NP-40) for 15min at 25�C. Slides were
washed thrice in 1X PBS and sequentially stained with secondary antibody (chicken anti-rat AF488, 1:200, 20min, 25�C) and tertiary
antibody (goat anti-chicken AF488, 1:200, 20min, 25�C) with three PBS washes in between each antibody incubation. To detect IdU,
slides were incubated (45min, 25�C) with mouse anti-BrdU (BD #347580, 1:5) and sequentially with secondary antibody (rabbit anti-
mouse AF594, 1:50, 20min, 25�C) and tertiary antibody (goat anti-rabbit AF594, 1:50, 20min, 25�C) with three PBS washes in between
each antibody incubation. Single-stranded DNA was stained (45min, 25�C) with mouse anti-ssDNA (MAB3034, Merck Millipore, 1:50)
and sequentially with secondary antibody (rabbit anti-mouse AF488 or AF350, 1:50, 20min, 25�C) and tertiary antibody (goat anti-
rabbit AF488 or AF350, 1:50, 20min, 25�C) with three PBS washes between each antibody incubation. Slides were mounted in
90% glycerol in 1X PBS and imaged using Leica SP5 confocal microscope. Tract lengths were measured using ImageJ.
Plasmid and siRNA transfections
JetPRIME transfection reagent (Polyplus Transfection, 114-07) was used for all plasmid and siRNA transfections, with 1mg of plasmid
DNA per well of a 6-well dish. A 1:2 ratio of plasmid DNA (mg): JetPRIME reagent (ml) was used. Transfection reaction mixtures were
vortexed thoroughly and incubated at room temperature for 10min before adding dropwise to cells. For siRNA transfections, 4ml of
JetPRIME reagent was used per well of a 6-well dish. Transfection reaction mixtures were vortexed thoroughly and incubated at room
temperature for 15min before adding dropwise to cells. Culture media was replaced with fresh media after 5h incubation at 37�C.
siRNA sequences used: siLuciferase: 50-CGUACGCGGAAUACUUCGA-30; siBRCA2: 50-GAAGAAUGCAGGUUUAAUA-30.
Subcellular Fractionation
2.5 3 106 HeLa Kyoto cells were seeded on 10 cm dishes. 24h after seeding, cells were treated and harvested by trypsinisation after
3h. Cell aliquots were taken from each sample for making whole cell extracts using RIPA buffer for lysis. The rest of the cells were
lysed and fractionated using the Subcellular Protein Fractionation Kit for Cultured Cells (ThermoFisher Scientific, #78840). Briefly,
cytoplasmic extraction buffer was added to cell pellets and samples were incubated at 4�C with gentle mixing for 10min. After centri-
fuging at 500 g for 5min, the supernatants were transferred to fresh tubes (cytoplasmic fraction). Next, membrane extraction buffer
was added to pellets, vortexed, and incubated at 4�C with gentle mixing for 10min. After centrifuging at 3000 g for 5min, the super-
natants were transferred to fresh tubes (membrane-bound fraction). Next, nuclear extraction buffer was added to pellets, vortexed
thoroughly, and incubated at 4�C with gentle mixing for 30min. After centrifuging at 5000 g for 5min, the supernatants were

 transferred to fresh tubes (nuclear soluble fraction). Finally, chromatin-bound extraction buffer (prepared according to kit instruc-
tions) was added to remaining pellets, which were thoroughly resuspended by pipetting. After incubation at room temperature for
15min, samples were vortexed and centrifuged at 16,000 g for 5min. Supernatants were transferred to fresh tubes (chromatin-bound
fraction).
Western blotting
Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (50mM Tris HCl, pH 7.4, 150mM NaCl, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 1% NP-40)
containing protease inhibitors (Roche, 11873580001) and 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT). Whole cell extracts were separated by electro-
phoresis, transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and blocked in 5% skimmed milk dissolved in 0.1%Tween/TBS.
Membranes were incubated with primary antibodies (a-BRCA2 (Merck Millipore, ab-1, 1:500), a-BRCA1 (Santa Cruz, C-20,
1:200), a-PALB2 (Bethyl A301-246A, 1:1000), a-RAD51 (GeneTex, 14B4, 1:500), a-p-ATM (S1981) (Abcam, ab81292, 1:1000),

1:500)) overnight at 4�C followed by washing in 0.1%Tween/TBS. Membranes were incubated with appropriate HRP-linked second-
ary antibodies at 25�C for 1h and washed thrice prior to signal detection. Membranes were developed by chemiluminescence using
ECL reagent.
Metaphase Spreads
Cells were treated as indicated in the text for 5h, washed three times with media and incubated at 37�C for 18h. Cells were treated
with 0.1 mg/ml colcemid (GIBCO 15212-012) for 3-6h and mitotic cells collected. 0.56% KCl solution was slowly added to mitotic cells
with gentle mixing and incubated at 37�C for 15min. Three drops of ice-cold Carnoy’s fixative was added to each sample and cells
pelleted at 100 g for 5min. Cells were gently resuspended in Carnoy’s fixative and fixed overnight at �20�C. Fixed samples were
washed thrice in ice-cold Carnoy’s fixative and spotted onto clean glass slides. Spotted glass slides were held over a beaker of
steaming water cells side up for 30 s before air-drying for at least 1h. Chromosomes were stained in Karyomax Giemsa Stain solution
(ThermoFisher, 10092013) for 5min, briefly washed twice in Gurr’s buffer, pH 6.8 (ThermoFisher, 10582013) and dried. Slides were
mounted in Permount Mounting Medium (VWR, 100496-550). Brightfield images were taken using an Olympus BX51 microscope
using 63x or 100x objective lenses.
Colony Formation Assay
300,000 cells per well of a 6-well plate were seeded and 24h later, treated with formaldehyde for 5h. Cells were washed with 1X PBS
and re-plated at 200 cells/well (HeLa) or 600 cells/well (HBEC) of a 6-well plate in triplicate. 10-14 days later, colonies were washed,
fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature and stained in 0.1% crystal violet solution (Sigma, HT90132). The number
of colonies was manually enumerated.
Cycloheximide chase assay
Cells were treated with 100 mg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma, C4859) and in the presence or absence of formaldehyde. DMSO was used
as a control for cycloheximide.
Measuring Cell Proliferation
5000 cells were seeded in each well of 24-well plates. 24h after seeding, time-lapsed images were obtained using an IncuCyte
system (Essen BioScience), with 10x magnification from 9 spots within each well of a 24-well plate every 2 hr over 72 hr. Cell con-
fluency was automatically determined from phase-contrast images at different time points, using the integrated IncuCyte software.
The IncuCyte software utilizes a software algorithm that calculates the area occupied by cells as a percentage of the total area of the
entire field to give the percentage confluency.
Protein extraction and in-solution digestion for SWATH-MS
Cell pellets were suspended in 10M Urea lysis buffer containing complete protease inhibitor cocktail and lysed by sonication at
4�C for 2 min using a VialTweeter device (Hielscher-Ultrasound Technology). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation
at 18,000 g for 1h. Supernatants were reduced by 10mM Tris-(2-carboxyethyl)-phosphine (TCEP) for 1h at 37�C and 20 mM
iodoacetamide (IAA) in the dark for 45 min at room temperature. Samples were further diluted by 1:6 (v/v) with 100 mM NH4HCO3
and digested with sequencing-grade porcine trypsin (Promega) at a protease/protein ratio of 1:25 overnight at 37�C. The amount
of purified peptides was determined using Nanodrop ND-1000 (Thermo Scientific) and 1.5 mg peptides were injected in each
LC-MS run.

 SWATH mass spectrometry
Peptide samples after digested were measured by SWATH mass spectrometry with liquid chromatographic (LC) (Collins et al., 2013;
Gillet et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2013). Specifically, the mass spectrometer was interfaced with an Eksigent NanoLC Ultra 2D Plus HPLC
system. Peptides were directly injected onto a 20-cm PicoFrit emitter (New Objective, self-packed to 20 cm with Magic C18 AQ 3-mm
200-A
˚ material), and then separated using a 90 min gradient from 5%–35% (buffer A 0.1% (v/v) formic acid, 2% (v/v) acetonitrile,
buffer B 0.1% (v/v) formic acid, 98% (v/v) acetonitrile) at a flow rate of 300 nL/min. In the present SWATH-MS mode, the SCIEX
5600 plus TripleTOF instrument was specifically tuned to optimize the quadrupole settings for the selection of 64 variable wide pre-
cursor ion selection windows. The 64-variable window schema was optimized based on a normal human cell lysate sample, covering
the precursor mass range of 400–1,200 m/z. Please refer to Table S3 for the isolation windows. SWATH MS2 spectra were collected
from 50 to 2,000 m/z. The collision energy (CE) was optimized for each window according to the calculation for a charge 2+ ion
centered upon the window with a spread of 15 eV. An accumulation time (dwell time) of 50 ms was used for all fragment-ion scans
in high-sensitivity mode and for each SWATH-MS cycle a survey scan in high-resolution mode was also acquired for 250 ms, resulting
in a duty cycle of �3.45 s.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
In all figures: ns, p-value > 0.05; *, p-value < 0.05; **, p-value < 0.01; ***, p-value < 0.001. The statistical methods used for comparisons
are indicated in the relevant figure legends and in the sections below.
DNA fiber analysis
DNA tract lengths were measured using ImageJ. For replication fork stability assays, at least 250 tracts were counted per condition
and the Mann-Whitney t test was used to determine p values. For sister fork symmetry assays, the ratio of sister forks was achieved
by dividing the length of the longer sister CIdU tract by that of the shorter sister CIdU tract which emanate from the same origin
of replication. At least 70 sister fork ratios were determined for each sample per experiment. The scatterplots in Figures 1B and
7A show combined results for three and two independent experiments respectively and the Mann-Whitney t test was used to
determine statistical significance.
Western blot analysis
Densitometric measurements were carried out used Image Studio Lite version 3.1. In Figure 2B, the histogram plots the mean ± SEM
from three independent experiments. In Figure 3D, the graph plots the mean ± SEM from three independent experiments and the
two-tailed Student’s t test was used to determine statistical significance. In Figures 5A–5C, the histograms plot the mean ± SEM
from eight (Figure 5A) and three (Figures 5B and 5C) independent experiments respectively and the two-tailed Student’s t test
was used to determine statistical significance in Figure 5A. In Figure S1I, the histogram plots the mean ± SEM from two independent
experiments. Where indicated, a single asterisk (*) indicates non-specific bands and a double asterisk (**) indicates probable
degradation products occurring during sample preparation.
Metaphase spread analysis
50 metaphases were analyzed per sample in each experiment. The Mann-Whitney t test was used to determine statistical
significance.
Colony formation assay analysis
Colonies were manually enumerated and the two-tailed Student’s t test was used to determine statistical significance.
Image acquisition and analysis
Stained cells were imaged on a Leica SP5 confocal microscope. Maximum projections of z stacks of each field were generated and
analyzed using Cellomics Bioapplication software using Compartment Analysis 4 (Thermo Scientific) algorithm for nuclei segmenta-
tion (based on nuclear DAPI stain), PCNA nuclear staining (based on average nuclear intensity), nuclear gH2AX and RAD51 foci
counts, EdU and EU staining (based on total nuclear intensity). For Figure 1A, the total nuclear intensity of EdU nuclear staining
per cell was determined using nuclear DAPI staining as a mask for nuclear segmentation. The histogram plots the mean ± SEM
from three independent experiments. For Figures 1C and 1D, thresholds for nuclei segmentation, PCNA average nuclear intensity,
gH2AX foci counts were manually optimized for each independent experiment but kept constant across samples within the same
experiment. At least 1500 cells were counted per sample in each experiment. The histograms in Figures 1C and 1D plot the
mean ± SEM from four and three independent experiments respectively and the two-tailed Student’s t test was used to determine
statistical significance. For Figure S1B, thresholds for nuclei segmentation and RAD51 foci counts were manually optimized for each
independent experiment but kept constant across samples within the same experiment. The histogram plots the mean ± SEM from
three independent experiments. At least 200 cells were counted per sample in each experiment and the two-tailed Student’s t test
was used to determine statistical significance. For Figure S7A, the total nuclear intensity of EU nuclear staining per cell was deter-
mined using nuclear DAPI staining as a mask for nuclear segmentation. At least 200 cells per condition were measured.

 SWATH-MS data analysis
The SWATH-MS identification was performed by OpenSWATH software (Ro
¨ st et al., 2014) searching against a previously established
SWATH assay library which contains mass spectrometric query parameters for 10,000 human proteins with unique Swiss-Prot iden-
tities (Rosenberger et al., 2014). OpenSWATH first identified the peak groups from all individual SWATH maps at a target FDR = 1%
and then aligned between SWATH maps using a novel TRIC (TRansfer of Identification Confidence) algorithm that was specifically
developed for targeted proteomic data analysis (Ro
¨ st et al., 2016). The re-quantification feature in OpenSWATH was enabled but only
those peptide signals detected in at least eight of the ten samples in both FA or control groups were accepted for the protein level
quantification, resulting in 34,575 peptide peak groups assigned to 4219 unique SwissProt proteins. The expression data matrix was
median normalized (using a simple normalization factor calculated by summing all the peak group signals per sample). To quantify the
protein abundance levels across samples, we summed up the most abundant peptides for each protein (i.e., top 3 peptide groups
based on intensity were used for those proteins identified with more than three proteotypic peptide signals whereas all the peptides
were summarized for other proteins) which allow for reliable estimation of global protein levels (Liu et al., 2015; Ludwig et al., 2012;
Wilhelm et al., 2014). The quantitative protein level matrix was then log2 transformed for statistical and bioinformatics analysis. The
fold changes were calculated based on the normalized SWATH-MS intensities for each protein. The two-tailed Student’s t test was
used to determine statistical significance and corrections for multiple hypothesis testing was carried out by Benjamini-Hochberg
correction of p values, which are reflected in the volcano plot (Figure 4C).

BRCA2+/999del5 �1 HBECs have lower pre-existing levels of BRCA2 protein than their BRCA2+/+ counterparts, similar levels are reached after formaldehyde
exposure. However, since BRCA2+/999del5 �1 HBECs exhibit replication tract instability after formaldehyde exposure whereas their BRCA2+/+ counterparts do not
