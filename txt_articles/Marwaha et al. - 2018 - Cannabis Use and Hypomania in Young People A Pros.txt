Background: Cannabis use in young people is common and 
associated with psychiatric disorders. However, the prospec-
tive link between cannabis use and bipolar disorder symptoms 
has rarely been investigated. The study hypothesis was that 
adolescent cannabis use is associated with hypomania in 
early adulthood via several potential etiological pathways. 
Methods: Data were used from the Avon Longitudinal Study 
of Parents and Children, a UK birth cohort study. The pro-
spective link between cannabis use at age 17 and hypoma-
nia at age 22–23 years was tested using regression analysis, 
adjusted for gender, early environmental risk factors, alcohol 
and drug use, and depression and psychotic symptoms at age 
18 years. Path analysis examined direct and indirect effects 
of the link and whether gender, childhood family adversity, 
or childhood abuse are associated with hypomania via an 
increased risk of cannabis use. Results: Data were avail-
able on 3370 participants. Cannabis use at least 2–3 times 
weekly was associated with later hypomania (OR = 2.21, 
95% CI = 1.49–3.28) after adjustment. There was a dose–
response relationship (any use vs weekly). Cannabis use 
mediated the association of both childhood sexual abuse and 
hypomania, and male gender and hypomania. The cannabis 
use-hypomania link was not mediated by depression or psy-
chotic symptoms. Conclusions: Adolescent cannabis use may 
be an independent risk factor for future hypomania, and the 
nature of the association suggests a potential causal link. 
Cannabis use mediates the link between childhood abuse and 
future hypomania. As such it might be a useful target for indi-
cated prevention of hypomania.

Introduction
Cannabis is one of the most commonly used illegal sub-
stances of abuse in western countries. Problematic use in 
the general population is as high as 9.5% in the United 
States,1 while 2.6% of the UK population report having 
been cannabis dependent in the last year.2 Its use is partic-
ularly common in young people.1 A recent study reported 
that 31% of young people have used cannabis 3 or more 
times by age 18 years.3 Cannabis use is linked to multiple 
harms, including cardiovascular disease, motor vehicle 
accidents, and mental health problems. Younger people 
are especially vulnerable to the harmful effects of canna-
bis use.4 In adolescents, it is linked to future expression of 
psychotic symptoms.5 Though apparent, the association 
with depression and anxiety is weaker.6,7 The prospec-
tive association between cannabis use and manic symp-
toms or bipolar disorder diagnosis is under-investigated, 
though converging evidence indicates its possible impor-
tance. First, there are high rates of co-occurrence of sub-
stance misuse and bipolar disorders8,9 (cannabis is the 
most frequently used drug in bipolar disorder). Second, 
cannabis use in bipolar disorder is known to be associ-
ated with worse treatment compliance10 and more hospi-
talizations.11 Third there is a cross-sectional link between 
substance misuse and adolescent-onset bipolar disor-
der.12 Finally bipolar disorder in adulthood may itself be 
associated with increasing cannabis use.13
Despite these multiple associations, only prospective 
studies can adequately establish whether cannabis use 
may be causally linked to manic symptoms or bipolar 
disorder. In a systematic literature review covering adults 
over 18 years of age, we identified 6 prospective studies 
examining this question. We concluded that cannabis use 
worsens manic symptoms in those with pre-existing bipo-
lar disorder, and might also contribute to the genesis of 
manic-type symptoms in those with no pre-existing bipo-
lar disorder.14 In one particularl relevant study, Tijssen 
et al15 examined the 8-year longitudinal impact of sub-
stance misuse in 705 adolescents aged 14–17 years. This 
sampling reduced the risks of reverse causality, given

that most bipolar disorder occurs after this, with a peak 
incidence at age 21 years.16 Cannabis use led to a 4-fold 
increase in the odds of subthreshold manic symptoms, 
though adjustment for psychotic symptoms was not pos-
sible. Thus, the direction and specificity of the associa-
tion remains unclear (ie, it is plausible that observed links 
were attributable to co-morbid psychotic symptoms).
A related question concerns the mechanisms by which 
cannabis use may lead to manic symptoms. Cannabis 
use may be an independent risk factor, or a mediat-
ing factor linking earlier risk exposures (eg, childhood 
abuse) or characteristics of the individual (eg, sex) to the 
 
expression of bipolar symptoms. Whilst epidemiolog-
ical research has begun to substantiate a mediating role 
for cannabis use in linking childhood trauma with adult 
psychosis,17 there has been virtually no investigation of 
parallel mechanisms in relation to bipolar disorder. One 
large cross-sectional study of adults has suggested an 
additive effect of childhood abuse and cannabis use on 
the clinical expression of bipolar disorder.18
In summary, prospective studies examining the asso-
ciation between cannabis use and hypomanic or manic 
symptomatology are few, and are focused on adult sam-
ples. Psychotic symptoms are frequently not controlled 
for, a serious limitation given significant evidence con-
necting cannabis and psychosis. Prospective studies 
examining this connection in the peak period of cannabis 
use and onset of hypomania are scarce, even though this 
is when potential interventions might be most effective.
Our main aim was to test the hypothesis that ado-
lescent cannabis use is prospectively associated with 
 
hypomania in young adulthood. We used path ana-
lytical methods to test several potential pathways si-
multaneously. Specifically, we addressed the following 
questions: 
(a) 
Is 
cannabis 
use 
independently 
associated 
with 
hypomania in early adulthood following adjustment for 
gender, early environmental risk factors, other drug use, 
and depression and psychotic symptoms at age 18 years? 
(b) Do males and females follow different pathways to 
hypomania depending on cannabis use? (c) Is exposure 
to childhood family adversity or abuse (physical, sexual) 
associated with hypomania via increased likelihood of 
cannabis use?
Methods
Subjects
The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children 
(ALSPAC) is a UK birth cohort examining the deter-
minants of development, health, and disease. The 
study has been described in detail elsewhere.19 ALSPAC 
recruited pregnant women in Avon with expected dates 
of delivery between the April 1, 1991 and December 31, 
1992. Fourteen thousand five hundred forty-one preg-
nant women were initially enrolled in the study, and 
had returned at least one questionnaire or attended a 
“Children in Focus” clinic by the July 19, 1999. Of these 
initial pregnancies, there were 14 676 foetuses, result-
ing in 14 062 live births, of which 13 988 children were 
alive at 1 year of age. When the oldest children were ap-
proximately 7 years old, the sample was bolstered with 
 
eligible cases who had failed to join the study originally. 
Consequently, when considering variables collected from 
age 7 onwards there are data available on 14 701 chil-
dren. The study website contains details of all the data 
that is available through a fully searchable data dictionary 
(http://www.bris.ac.uk/alspac/researchers/data-access/
data-dictionary/). From the first trimester of pregnancy 
parents completed postal questionnaires about the study 
children’s health and development. In addition, children 
attended annual assessment clinics, including face-to face 
interviews, psychological, and physical tests. Ethical ap-
proval was obtained from the ALSPAC Law and Ethics 
committee and the Local Research Ethics Committees.
The representativeness of ALSPAC target population 
was assessed during the planning stage of the study by 
comparing the characteristics of children in the Avon area 
to 13, 135 children in the Child Health and Education 
Study. The Avon target population was considered to be 
relatively representative of the whole of Great Britain.20
Assessments
Study participants were invited to complete a compre-
hensive postal questionnaire when they were 22–23 years 
old. This assessment includes the Hypomania Checklist 
Questionnaire (HCL-32), a self-report measure of life-
time experience of manic symptoms.21 Respondents are 
asked to consider a time when they were in a “high or 
hyper” condition and endorse statements about their 
emotions, thoughts, and behavior during this time. There 
are 32 symptom statements. While the HCL-32 was 
 
developed as a screening instrument for people with 
 
bipolar disorder type II in people with recurrent depres-
sive disorders, it is also a valid and sensitive tool for young, 
nonclinical populations.22 In line with previous work,23 
we constructed a variable to represent lifetime history of 
hypomania. Those with a symptom score of 14 or more 
(out of 32) were classed as having hypomania if they also 
reported at least one incident of “negative consequences” 
or of “negative plus positive consequences,” as a result 
of hypomanic symptoms; and that mood changes caused 
a reaction (either neutral, negative, or negative and pos-
itive) in close others; and that symptoms lasted for a du-
ration of “2–3 days” or more. This was chosen because 
the DSM 4-day threshold excludes many individuals with 
bipolar disorder II23 and fits the ICD-10 requirement for 
hypomania to have lasted for a “few days.”
Cannabis use was assessed when participants were 
17 years’ old. Young people were asked whether they 
had ever used cannabis (yes/no) and the frequency of 
use in the last 12 months (ie, monthly or less, 2–4 times

Cannabis and Hypomania
monthly, 2–3 times weekly, 4+ times weekly). We con-
structed 2 cannabis use variables. The first represented 
any cannabis use (no/yes). The second was constructed 
to represent frequent (at least 2–3 times weekly cannabis 
use), vs infrequent or no cannabis use (ie, cannabis use 
less than weekly = 0; cannabis use 2–3 times or 4+ times 
weekly = 1) in line with previous studies.24 No direct 
information was available on duration of use other than 
in the last year.
Multiple family risk factors were assessed using the 
Family Adversity Index (FAI) during pregnancy (“long 
index”), 2 years (“long index”), and 4 years (“short 
index”). The FAI “long index” comprises 18 items, eg, ma-
ternal affective disorder, financial difficulties. The short 
index has the same items, but excludes social, practical, 
and financial support. If an adversity item was reported, 
it was given one point. Points were summed at each time-
point for a total FAI score across the 3 time-points.
As there are robust associations of physical25 and 
sexual26 abuse with mental illness, we included abuse as a 
confounder. Physical and sexual abuse were reported by 
the mother via postal questionnaire when children were 
1.5, 3.5, 4.8, 5.8, and 6.8 years old. We coded for the pres-
ence of any physical or sexual abuse at any time-point.
Self-reported alcohol use was assessed at age 17 with 
the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test.27 The 
AUDIT comprises 10 questions with responses ranging 
from 0 to 4 for each question. Scores were summed and 
dichotomized, with a total score of 8 or more indicating 
hazardous alcohol use.27
Participants were asked about their use of stimulant 
(ie, cocaine, amphetamines) and hallucinogenic drugs at 
age 17. As these three variables were very highly corre-
lated, we summed the responses to create a dichotomous 
control variable indicating use of at least one drug.
Psychotic symptoms were assessed at age 18 using the 
validated Psychosis Like Symptom Interview. The in-
terview incorporates 12 core questions relating to key 
psychotic experiences occurring since age 12. These are 
hallucinations, delusions, and experiences of thought 
 
interference. Consistent with previous research, we coded 
the presence of at least one definite psychotic symptom 
not attributable to sleep or fever.28
Depression symptoms were assessed using the vali-
dated Revised Clinical Interview Schedule (CIS-R) at 
17–18 years.29 The CIS-R was self-administered via com-
puterized interview, and establishes the severity of core 
symptoms of depression. We constructed a dichotomous 
depression variable representing any ICD-10 diagnosis of 
depression (whether mild, moderate, or severe).
Analysis
As a substantial proportion of the original sample was lost 
to follow-up, we conducted logistic regressions to iden-
tify significant predictors of attrition. Adolescents lost to 
attrition were more often boys, of low birth-weight, and 
exposed to family adversity and frequent maternal shout-
ing (see supplementary table S1 available online). Using 
the variables associated with selective dropout as the pre-
dictors, we fitted a logistic regression model (nonresponse 
vs response outcome) to determine weights for each indi-
vidual using the inverse probability of response. We use 
this weighting variable in the logistic regression analyses.
We conducted unadjusted and adjusted logistic regres-
sions (forced entry method) using SPSS version 22 to 
 
examine whether cannabis use (any and at least 2–3 times 
weekly) at age 17 years was associated with hypomania at 
22–23 years. We used the generalized linear model (GLM) 
command to enable us to re-adjust the sample size fol-
lowing inflation from computing the inverse probability 
weights. We conducted the analysis in stages to test four 
models. Model A examined the unadjusted associations 
between cannabis use and hypomania. Model B exam-
ined associations following adjustment for psychotic and 
depressive symptoms. Model C additionally adjusted for 
other drug and alcohol use. Model D additionally con-
trolled for gender, family adversity, and early childhood 
physical or sexual abuse.
We conducted path analysis using Mplus version 7. 
Path analysis can be used to determine whether nonex-
perimental data fit well with an a priori causal model 
allowing for the examination of direct and indirect effects 
of multiple independent and dependent variables.24
Modeled associations are unidirectional, and based on 
the temporal ordering of assessments (ie, earlier risk fac-
tors are hypothesized to predict later outcomes). However, 
because the data are nonexperimental, we cannot conclu-
sively ascertain whether associations are causal.30
Using this approach, we modeled several potential 
causal pathways involving at least 2–3 times weekly can-
nabis use and hypomania, while controlling for correlations 
between concurrent risk factors (ie, cannabis use and other 
substance use) and psychopathology (ie, depression and 
psychotic symptoms). We also adjusted for the prospec-
tive associations between other important risk factors and 
hypomania (ie, other substance use, depression, and psy-
chotic symptoms). Specifically, we modeled indirect asso-
ciations between gender, family adversity, and abuse and 
subsequent hypomania via cannabis use. We also modeled 
indirect associations between cannabis use and hypomania 
via psychotic and depression symptoms. We modeled direct 
associations between cannabis and substance use, depres-
sion and psychotic symptoms, and subsequent hypomania.
Due to the very high correlations between alcohol 
and other drug use, we combined these 2 variables into 
a categorical substance use index to improve the stability 
and fit of the model (ie, reducing the impact of multicol-
linearity). We created an ordinal variable to represent no 
use, drug or alcohol use, and both drug and alcohol use.
We used probit estimation as recommended for path 
models with categorical outcomes.31 Probit regression is a

log-linear approach analogous to logistic regression, pro-
ducing similar chi-square statistics, P values and conclu-
sions to logit models. Coefficients indicate the strength of 
the relationship between the predictor variable and the 
probability of group membership, representing the change 
in the probability of “case status” associated with a unit 
change in the independent variable. Hence, it is important 
to keep the scale representing the predictor in mind when 
interpreting results. For example, a probit coefficient of 
0.031 indicates that each one-point increase in the family 
adversity scale resulted in an increase of 0.031 standard 
deviations in the predicted Z score of depression symptoms. 
Coefficients for dichotomous predictors are expected to be 
larger. The WLSMV estimator (weighted least squares with 
robust standard errors, mean, and variance adjusted) was 
used to yield probit co-efficients for categorical outcomes. 
Missing data were accommodated using the reliable full in-
formation maximum likelihood method.32
Results
Data were available on 3370 participants who reported 
on hypomania symptoms at 22–23 years. Table 1 shows 
the frequencies of sociodemographic, substance use, and 
psychopathological variables in the final sample stratified 
by sex.
Alcohol and cannabis use was significantly associ-
ated: any cannabis use, odds ratio (OR) = 1.82; 95% 
CI = 1.45–2.28, and at least 2–3 times weekly can-
nabis use, OR = 2.87; 95% CI =1.68–4.91. Any and at 
least 2–3 times weekly cannabis use were very strongly 
 
related to other drug use (ie, amphetamines, hallucino-
gens, or cocaine): OR = 40.90; 95% CI = 27.41–61.03 and 
 
OR= 26.30; 95% CI = 18.21–37.97, respectively. We 
 
accordingly conducted a collinearity diagnosis. Variance 
inflation factors (VIFs) and tolerance values did not 
 
indicate an issue with multicollinearity in the logistic 
regressions.33
The results of the logistic regressions (weighted for the 
predictors of attrition) are reported in table 2. In unadjusted 
analysis (Model A), both any and at least 2–3 times weekly 
cannabis use were significantly associated with hypomania 
at 22–23 years, and demonstrated a dose-response relation-
ship, ie, a stronger association for use at least 2–3 times 
weekly. In Model B, associations were only slightly atten-
uated after adjustment for psychotic and depression symp-
toms. In Model C, associations were further attenuated by 
adjustment for other drug and alcohol use, but remained 
robust. In Model D, associations were reduced further by 
adjustment for gender, family adversity, and experience of 
childhood abuse, but again remained significant.
Cannabis use at least 2–3 times weekly significantly pre-
dicted both depression (OR = 2.48; 95% CI=1.60–3.83) 
and psychotic symptoms (OR = 3.33; 95% CI = 2.01–
5.53) in unadjusted analysis.
Path analysis fit indices indicated excellent model 
fit: χ2 = 2.57, P = .92; RMSEA = 0.00; CFI = 1.00. 
Consistent with the adjusted logistic regression analysis, 
cannabis use at 17 years was significantly and independ-
ently associated with subsequent hypomania in the final 
model controlling for all pathways. Direct associations 
are shown in figure 1. The association between cannabis 
use and hypomania was not significantly mediated by de-
pression or psychotic symptoms. However, cannabis use 
significantly mediated associations of gender and abuse 
with subsequent hypomania (table 3).
Discussion
Main Findings
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to test 
the prospective association between adolescent cannabis 
use and hypomania in early adulthood, while controlling 
for a range of environmental risk factors, other substance 
use, and associated psychopathologies. Our analysis indi-
cated 3 pathways whereby cannabis use is associated with 
subsequent hypomania.
First, adolescent cannabis use is independently associ-
ated with hypomania in early adulthood. This effect was 
independent of other key risk factors (or markers) for

Cannabis and Hypomania
hypomania, including other drugs use, hazardous alco-
hol use, psychotic symptoms, and depression in late ado-
lescence. This finding is consistent with population data 
in adults suggesting the association between cannabis 
use and manic symptomatology is independent of psy-
chotic symptoms.34 The current study extends this previ-
ous work by demonstrating a prospective association in 
adolescents in which the cause (cannabis) is most likely to 
have preceded its effect (hypomania). The logistic regres-
sion analysis implied a dose–response relationship in that 
the odds ratios for frequent use was greater than for any 
use. Though we are tentative in our conclusions because 
of the observational nature of the data, our control for 
numerous confounders, the prospective association, and 
the dose–response findings are consistent with a causal 
role for cannabis use in the emergence of hypomania in 
young people.
Second, male sex is significantly indirectly associated 
with hypomania through an increased likelihood of can-
nabis use. Harmful use of cannabis is more frequent in 
men than women,2 and this study shows its use in men may 
be much more important in the pathway to hypomania.
Finally, childhood physical or sexual abuse is indirectly 
associated with hypomania through an increased likelihood

of cannabis use. Both childhood abusive experiences and 
cannabis use in adolescence and adulthood have been 
shown to be connected to the expression of bipolar disor-
der psychopathology and to markers of its severity.12,26,35 
Furthermore, previous studies have demonstrated that 
childhood trauma and cannabis use are also linked,18 with 
some studies indicating a prospective association indepen-
dent of markers of deprivation or family dysfunction.36 
The prospective analysis presented here is the first to show 
that cannabis use in adolescence may be part of the mecha-
nism whereby childhood abuse can lead to bipolar disor-
der psychopathology. It appears that cannabis use seems to 
be one response of an individual to traumatic childhood 
experiences that can lead to harmful psychopathology in 
young adulthood. Our results align with those of Aas et al18 
in highlighting the importance of both cannabis use and 
childhood trauma in bipolar disorder symptomatology.
The precise neurochemical mechanism by which can-
nabis might lead to hypomania is unclear, reflecting the 
incomplete knowledge of the biology of bipolar disorders 
in general.37 However, current evidence provides tentative 
insights. Neurobiological studies indicate the brain is par-
ticularly vulnerable to the effects of cannabis use during 
adolescence. It has the potential to adjust reward system 
sensitivity38 and can interfere with mechanisms related 
to establishing axonal connections during development. 
A recent systematic review of the literature highlights that 
converging evidence from imaging as well as pharmaco-
logical studies indicates a state of hyperdopaminergia in 
mania.39 Cannabis causes signaling changes in the meso-
limbic system, resulting in dopaminergic hyperactivity, 
and some cannabinoid receptors are known to reduce the 
uptake of dopamine thereby potentiating its actions.40 
Increased reward circuitry activity demonstrated by 
reduced differences in activation of dopaminergic brain 
areas (eg, nucleus accumbens) during anticipation and 
receipt of rewards has been demonstrated in manic 
patients; this differentiates them from patients with 
schizophrenia and healthy controls.41 Finally dopaminer-
gic signaling is known to increase as part of normal brain 
maturation during the adolescent period.42 Cannabis use 
may compound this, leading to an increased propensity 
to experience hypomanic symptomatology.15
Strengths and Limitations
This study had several strengths. The prospective assess-
ments and sampling adolescents at age 17 years reduces 
the risk of reverse causality. The path analysis also con-
trols for all associations between correlated items, ena-
bling an examination of simultaneous pathways and 
determining the specificity of associations.
There are also study limitations. Our conclusions 
 
regarding the link between cannabis use and hypomania 
must remain cautious. The HCL-32 asks about a life-
time history of hypomania symptoms, and so in some 
cases the experience assessed at age 22–23 years may have 
preceded cannabis use. However, as the peak incidence 
of hypomania/mania appears to be bi-modal with the 
first peak between age 21 and 23 years and the second 
at around age 35 years,16,43 a majority of participants are 
likely to have first experienced hypomania after the age of 
cannabis use assessment. There may also be pre-existing 
psychopathology that could link to cannabis use and hy-
pomanic symptoms that we did not account for.
The HCL-32 was used as a measure of hypomania but 
this will not always equate with a clinical diagnosis of 
hypomania. Nevertheless, we used a well-recognized cut-
off score for hypomania, amplified by measures of du-
ration and impact on functioning. This is likely to have 
improved the capacity of the HCL to identify clinical 
levels of hypomania.23 If they persist and cause dysfunc-
tion hypomanic symptoms are known to be continuous 
with and to have strong predictive values for diagnostic 
bipolar disorders.44 Finally, there was a high rate of attri-
tion within the sample, but we carefully weighted our 
analysis according to predictors of drop-out.
Experiences of physical and sexual abuse were reported 
by the mother rather than child, potentially leading to an 
under-reporting of these factors. Under-reporting likely 
leads to “nondifferential misclassification,” ie, an under-
reporting in both groups, which may exert a downward

Cannabis and Hypomania
bias on estimated associations between abuse and out-
comes.45 Data on childhood maltreatment between age 7 
and 17 (when cannabis use data were collected) was not 
available and this may have impacted on our final model. 
Nevertheless, we still found a significant indirect associa-
tion between abuse and hypomania via cannabis use sug-
gesting this finding is relatively robust.
It is conceivable that hypomania symptoms may have 
been secondary to continuing use of substances such as 
cannabis and stimulants between assessment at age 17 and 
22–23 years, though we do not know the extent to which 
use continued over this period. The HCL-32 requires 
people to consider a period in their life when they were 
feeling high while not using drugs or alcohol. This caveat 
in the questions in the HCL reduces the risk that hypo-
manic symptoms were closely linked to periods when a 
young person was using cannabis, stimulants, or alcohol.
Conclusions
Despite these limitations, we show adolescent cannabis 
use is an independent risk factor for future hypomania, 
and the nature of the associations found is suggestive 
of a causal link, though the gold standard for inferring 
causality of course remains intervention. The study also 
identifies cannabis use as a candidate mechanism for 
explaining how childhood abuse may lead to hypomania 
in adulthood. This is important in the context of the push 
in many jurisdictions to legalize or decriminalize can-
nabis. Consistent with the stage specific model of mental 
disorders linking intervention to stage of illness,46 our 
findings suggest frequent cannabis use is likely to be a 
suitable target for interventions that may allay the risk of 
young people developing bipolar disorder.
