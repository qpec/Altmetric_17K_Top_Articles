Abstract
Objective: To explore the ED contribution to prescription opioid use for opioid naïve patients by 
comparing the guideline concordance of ED prescriptions to those attributed to other settings and 
the risk of patients continuing to long term opioid use.
Methods: Analysis of administrative claims data (OptumLabs™ Data Warehouse 2009–2015) of 
opioid naïve privately insured and Medicare Advantage (aged and disabled) beneficiaries to 
compare characteristics of opioid prescriptions attributed to the ED with those attributed to other 
settings. Concordance with CDC guidelines and rate of progression to long-term opioid use are 
reported.

 Results: We identified 5.2 million opioid fills that met inclusion criteria. Opioid prescriptions 
from the ED were more likely to adhere to CDC guidelines for dose, days supply, and formulation 
than those attributed to non-ED settings. Disabled Medicare beneficiaries were the most likely to 
progress to long-term use, with 13.4% of their fills resulting in long-term use, compared to 6.2% 
of aged Medicare and 1.8% of commercial beneficiaries’ fills. Compared to non-ED settings, 
commercial beneficiaries receiving opioid prescriptions in the ED were 46% less likely, aged 
Medicare 56% less likely, and disabled Medicare 58% less likely to progress to long-term opioid 
use.
Conclusion: Compared to non-ED settings, opioid prescriptions provided to opioid naïve 
patients in the ED were more likely to align with CDC recommendations. They were shorter, 
written for lower daily doses, and less likely to be for long acting formulations. Prescriptions from 
the ED are associated with a lower risk of progression to long-term use.
Introduction
Background
Following a fourfold rise in opioid prescriptions since 1999, long-term opioid use has 
become major public health issues in the United States.1,2 Because opioids are frequently 
prescribed to patients dismissed from emergency departments (ED), it is important to 
understand the relationship between ED opioid prescribing for opioid naïve individuals and 
their risk of progressing to recurrent opioid use.3 Some policymakers and members of the 
public perceive EDs to be a significant source of overprescription of opioids.4–6 This 
perception may stem from the fact that many ED visits involve chronic or acute pain; adult 
patients reported pain as the primary symptom in 45% of ED visits.7 With so many patients 
in pain, it isn’t surprising that recent studies have found that 17-21% of all ED discharges 
included a prescription for opioids.4,8
Importance
Despite the public health consequences of nonmedical and long-term prescription opioid 
use,9–12 short-term use of these medications is clinically indicated in select settings.13,14 
With some rare exceptions, health care professionals do not intend for an initial opioid 
prescription issued for an acute pain episode to result in indefinite repeat prescriptions.15 
Unfortunately, a dearth of information exists about the progression of intended short-term 
use to an unintended prolonged pattern of use16,17 which may occur in 1.5% to 27% of 
opioid-naïve patients after receiving an initial prescription.18–25 This is critically important 
because intentional short-term use is emerging as a previously under-recognized segue to 
unintended prolonged opioid use.16–22,24–26 One of the 5 key questions proposed in the 2016 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guideline for prescribing opioids for 
chronic pain was to determine the effects of opioid therapy for acute pain on long-term 
opioid use.27 The goal of these guidelines is to improve opioid prescribing practices to 
ensure patients have access to safer treatment while reducing the risks of non-medical use 
and overdose.
Limited research has been conducted to date on prescribing practices for acute pain that 
limit risk of long-term opioid use. Current recommendations are to prescribe the lowest

 effective dose and quantity needed for the expected duration of pain. With new guidelines 
and ED clinicians facing the challenge of patients seeking help for uncontrolled pain, it is 
natural to ask whether and how prescribing in the ED compares with other settings. The 
guidelines were not published until after the study period; our goal in using their 
recommendations is not to determine the adherence rates to the CDC guidelines per se, but 
rather as a source of reasonable and evidence-based standards for comparing prescriptions 
attributed to different settings.
Goals of this investigation
We used administrative claims data to compare characteristics of opioid prescriptions written 
for opioid naïve patients dismissed from the ED and other settings and evaluated the risk of 
long-term use of prescription opioids by addressing these questions:
1.
To what extent are opioid prescriptions issued to opioid-naïve patients in the ED 
or non-ED settings concordant with best practices on the number of days 
supplied, the daily dose of the prescription, and the number of prescriptions filled 
for long-acting or extended-release formulations?
2.
For opioid naïve patients, what is the difference in the rate of progression to 
long-term opioid use after an initial prescription in the ED compared to a non-
ED setting?
Methods
We adhered to the RECORD statement (REporting of studies Conducted using 
Observational Routinely-collected health Data).28
Study design and setting
We conducted an analysis of administrative claims data from 1/1/2009 through 12/31/2015 
from the OptumLabs Data Warehouse (OLDW), a database comprised of privately insured 
and Medicare Advantage enrollees throughout the US; more than 35 million unique people 
had both medical and prescription drug coverage at some time during the study period.29 
OLDW contains longitudinal health information on enrollees from geographically diverse 
regions across the US with the greatest representation from the Southern and Midwestern 
states.30 It includes adjudicated claims for all healthcare services incurred by beneficiaries 
and submitted to the insurance company for payment. The included plans provide coverage 
for professional, facility, laboratory, and pharmacy claims. Administrative data include 
beneficiary sex, race/ethnicity, age, and dates of coverage. Medical claims include 
International Classification of Diseases, 9th and 10th Revision procedure and diagnosis 
codes; Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) procedure codes; site of 
service codes; and provider specialty codes.31 The commercial population covered by 
OLDW is similar to the United States population of commercially insured people in age, 
race/ethnicity, and gender. Further detail is provided in web appendices.
This study was determined to be exempt from review by the Mayo Clinic Institutional 
Review Board.

 Selection of Included Prescription Fills
We identified opioid prescriptions filled between 1/1/2009 and 12/31/2015 by beneficiaries 
of all ages who had both medical and pharmacy coverage. In order to focus our attention on 
people for whom long-term opioid use is an important risk, we examined claims in the 3 
months before each opioid fill and excluded prescription fills by beneficiaries who either had 
1) any hospice claims, or 2) at least 2 physician visits with a cancer diagnosis in those 3 
months. (See web appendices for codes used to identify cancer and hospice beneficiaries.)
We focused on opioid prescription fills among opioid-naïve beneficiaries, defined as having 
no opioid fills in the prior 6 months. As such, we excluded fills for beneficiaries with less 
than 6 months of insurance enrollment before the index fill and those who had any opioid 
fills during those 6 months. We limited our cohort to the first opioid-naïve fill for each 
beneficiary—the index fill. Our final cohort consists of 5.2 million index fills. A cohort flow 
chart is provided in Figure 1.
Variables
Opioid fill: We identified National Drug Codes for all opioids available during any part of 
the study period. For this study, we classified tramadol as an opioid. The complete list of 
medications classified as opioids for this study is provided in web appendices.
We used conversion factors provided by the CDC to convert the daily prescribed opioid dose 
to milligrams of morphine equivalents (MME).32 Prescriptions written for 1000 MME or 
more per day were excluded from the analysis (n=22,607; 0.04% of opioid fills by people 
with medical and prescription coverage) as extreme outliers.
If multiple doses of the same opioid were filled on the same day with the same prescriber 
ID, we merged those fills and calculated a combined daily dose in MME. In rare cases 
(N=56,845 beneficiaries and 114,507 opioid naïve fills) beneficiaries filled prescriptions for 
multiple different opioids or the same opioid with different prescribers on the same day. In 
these cases, each fill was included separately in the analysis. For this reason, the opioid fill is 
the unit of analysis rather than the beneficiary. Complete details are provided in web 
appendices.
Prescription source: We used information from medical claims in the 30 days prior to and 
including the date of the index fill to determine the most likely source of the prescription. 
Detailed information is provided in web appendices. We classified the most likely source of 
each index fill as 1) ED visit only; 2) non-ED visit only, which combines inpatient, 
outpatient, ambulatory surgery, and dental/accidental dental; 3) unknown source, which 
includes prescriptions where both ED and non-ED services were provided on the same day 
(4.3% of all prescriptions), as well as prescriptions for which there was no medical claim in 
the 30 days leading up to and including the prescription fill date. A substantial proportion of 
prescriptions had no visits in the prior 30 days: 22% for the Commercial population and 
10% for the Medicare population; this rate is similar to study using a different source of 
commercial claims which found 28% of opioid fills unmatched with a look back period of 2 
weeks.33 Some of these prescriptions were likely written by dentists, who have been

 estimated to write 6.4% of opioid prescriptions.34 We did not observe most dental visits, as 
dentistry is not included in medical insurance benefits. In our sample of fills to opioid-naïve 
patients, 7.0% of fills with a known prescriber specialty were written by a dentist or dental 
specialist. We present the results for prescriptions with unknown source throughout, but do 
not focus on the interpretation of this group of prescriptions.
All patients in the study were opioid naïve, with no insurance-paid opioid fills in the prior 6 
months, which decreases the variability in the dose and duration of opioids that would be 
considered appropriate. It is likely that -regardless of the setting—people receiving a new 
opioid prescription with no prior recent fills were either experiencing acute pain or were 
experiencing an acute exacerbation of a chronic problem. Appropriate prescribing practices 
for acute pain or acute exacerbations of chronic problems are likely similar across settings.
Beneficiary characteristics: Administrative information was used to determine beneficiary 
age, race/ethnicity, sex, and type of insurance (commercial vs. Medicare). We used type of 
insurance and beneficiary age to identify 3 key patient populations: 1) commercially insured 
of all ages (Commercial), 2) people eligible for Medicare due to age (aged Medicare), and 3) 
people with Medicare coverage who were under age 65 but qualified for Medicare due to 
long-term disability, end-stage renal disease, or other serious conditions (disabled 
Medicare).
To assess patient illness burden, we used the Elixhauser comorbidity measures, a set of 31 
measures indicating presence of comorbidities associated with increased risk of mortality.35 
We used ICD9 and ICD10 codes to identify these comorbidities in the 6 months prior to the 
index fill.36 We required a diagnosis to be present on one inpatient stay or 2 separate 
outpatient visits. Each index fill was categorized with flags for the Elixhauser comorbidities 
and whether the beneficiary had any claims in the 6 months prior to the fill.
Outcomes
We assessed concordance with best practice in opioid prescribing as summarized in the CDC 
guidelines.27 One recommendation states that for acute pain, “Three days or less will often 
be sufficient; more than seven days will rarely be needed.” The number of days supplied was 
extracted from the pharmacy claim. We coded binary variables for prescriptions for more 
than 3 days and more than 7 days supplied.
Another recommendation states that physicians should write prescriptions for the lowest 
effective dose. For patients using opioids for chronic pain, the CDC urged caution if 
increasing doses to above 50 MME per day; doses above 90 MME per day were suggested 
to be appropriate only for pain specialists to prescribe. Binary variables indicated whether an 
index fill was written for more than 50 or more than 90 MME per day. As these would be 
exceptionally high doses for opioid-naïve patients, we expected to identify a small 
proportion of fills in this dose range.
A third recommendation from the guideline states that extended-release/long-acting opioids 
should not be used when starting opioid therapy. We anticipated prescriptions for extended-
release and long-acting formulations would be rare in a cohort of opioid-naïve patients.

 To determine the risk of long-term use of opioids, we examined opioid fills in the 12 months 
following the index fill. Long-term opioid use was defined using the Consortium to Study 
Opioid Risks and Trends (CONSORT) criteria: episodes of opioid prescribing lasting longer 
than 90 days and 120 or more total days’ supply or 10 or more prescriptions in the one year 
following the index fill.37 Only beneficiaries with at least 12 months of continuous 
enrollment after the index fill were included in this analysis. Because this analysis was 
performed on a different population than the analyses of guideline concordance (which was 
allowed to have less than 12 months of follow-up), we repeated all guideline concordance 
analyses using just the cohort with at least 12 months of follow-up. We found no difference 
in the results of these analyses. A full comparison of results is presented in web appendices.
Analysis
Distributions of demographic and fill characteristics were compared using χ2 goodness-of-
fit tests, one-way ANOVA, and a Wald test for equality of coefficients after Poisson 
regression; see web appendices for further detail. We report 95% confidence intervals (CIs) 
for selected results in the text; all CIs are presented in tables or Appendices.
Logistic regression was used to measure the association between the source of the initial 
prescription and study outcomes. Prescription source (ED, non-ED, unknown) was 
interacted with beneficiary type (Commercial, aged Medicare, disabled Medicare) in the 
model. Covariates included year (continuous), age, age-squared, and age-cubed, female sex, 
race/ethnicity, indicators for each Elixhauser comorbidity, and whether the beneficiary had 
any medical claims in the 6 months before the fill. Complete results from logistic regression 
models are provided in web appendices. Adjusted probabilities of outcomes were calculated 
for each beneficiary type and prescription source. Risk ratios were generated from these 
probabilities, with 95% confidence intervals (CI) calculated using the delta method.38 
Stata/MP version 14.2 was used for all analyses.39
We performed a supplementary analysis treating time as a categorical variable to allow 
estimation of time trends in the proportion of prescriptions concordant with guidelines. 
Results are described briefly in the text and presented in full in web appendices.
Results
We identified 5,241,948 naïve opioid fills that met inclusion criteria (Table 1). The rate of 
naïve opioid fills per person-year was similar across the three populations, with 0.07 naïve 
fills per person-year for the Commercial, 0.07 for the aged Medicare, and 0.06 for the 
disabled Medicare population (difference significant at P <0.0001, but a minor clinical 
difference). We report the total opioid fills per person-year (including both naïve and non-
naïve fills, and including buprenorphine and methadone fills) for context. Though the rates 
of opioid naïve fills are similar across the three groups, the disabled Medicare population 
filled 7.15 total opioid prescriptions per person-year: 4 times more than the aged Medicare 
population and 8 times more than the Commercial population.

 Main Results
1. Prescription sources and drug prescribed—The proportion of prescriptions 
attributed to the ED was 11.7% in aged Medicare, 13.3% in Commercial, and 17.4% in the 
disabled Medicare population (Table 1). The most common medication prescribed for naïve 
fills across all treatment settings was hydrocodone (comprising 58.9% of Commercial fills, 
49.2% aged Medicare and 49.7% disabled Medicare) (Table 1).
2. Guideline concordance—Guideline concordance of prescriptions is reported in 
Tables 1 and 2 and in Figure 2A-F. Unadjusted rates of guideline concordance by 
beneficiary population are reported in Table 1, adjusted rates of concordance by beneficiary 
population and treatment setting (ED, non-ED, unknown) in Table 2, and adjusted risk ratios 
in Figure 2A-F. A table of risk ratios with 95% CIs is provided in web appendices.
2.1 Days supplied: It was common for opioid naïve beneficiaries to fill prescriptions 
exceeding 3 days supply, with unadjusted proportions ranging from 57.4% among 
Commercial to 68.0% among disabled Medicare beneficiaries (Table 1). Prescriptions from 
non-ED settings were the most likely to exceed 3 days: 65.9% among Commercial 
beneficiaries, 74.6% for aged Medicare, and 76.8% for disabled Medicare (Table 2); 
regression adjusted). Prescriptions from the ED were 44% (Commercial: adjusted risk ratio 
0.56 [0.56,0.56]) to 52% (disabled Medicare: adjusted risk ratio 0.48 [0.47,0.49]) less likely 
to exceed 3 days supply than those from non-ED settings (Figure 2-A).
Prescriptions from the ED were also less likely to exceed 7 days supply compared to non-
ED prescriptions. In the ED, adjusted proportions of prescriptions exceeding 7 days were 
84% to 91% lower than in the non-ED setting (adjusted risk ratio comparing ED to non-ED 
was 0.16 [0.16,0.16] in the Commercial population, 0.12 [0.12,0.13] in the aged Medicare 
population, and 0.09 [0.08,0.10] in the disabled Medicare population; adjusted percentages 
in Table 2, risk ratios in Figure 2-B).
2.2 Daily dose: Prescriptions for high MME doses were common; 17.0% to 19.9% 
exceeded 50 MME per day, and 5.2% to 6.0% exceeded 90 MME per day (unadjusted 
proportions; see Table 1 for details). Prescriptions from the ED were 23% to 37% less likely 
to exceed 50 MME (Figure 2-C; regression adjusted) and 33% to 54% less likely to exceed 
90 MME than those attributed to non-ED settings (Figure 2-D; regression adjusted).
2.3 Long-acting/extended-release: Prescriptions for long-acting (LA) or extended-
release(ER) formulations were rare among opioid naïve beneficiaries, with unadjusted 
percentages ranging from 0.5% of Commercial to 1.9% of disabled Medicare prescriptions.
In the regression-adjusted analysis, prescriptions from the ED were 86% to 92% less likely 
to be written for LA or ER formulations than those attributed to non-ED settings (risk ratios 
ranged from 0.08 [0.07,0.09] in the Commercial population to 0.14 [0.11,0.17] in the aged 
Medicare population; Figure 2-E).
3. Progression to long-term opioid use—In all beneficiary populations, 
prescriptions attributed to the ED were less likely to progress to long-term opioid use. For

 beneficiaries seen in the ED, 1.1% of Commercial beneficiaries, 3.1% of aged Medicare, and 
6.2% of disabled Medicare progressed to long-term use (Table 2). Commercial beneficiaries 
seen in the ED were 46% (adjusted risk ratio 0.54 [0.53,0.56]) less likely to progress to 
long-term use than Commercial beneficiaries seen in non-ED settings. Aged Medicare 
beneficiaries were 56% (adjusted risk ratio 0.44 [0.42,0.46]) and disabled Medicare were 
58% (adjusted risk ratio 0.42 [0.39,0.45]) less likely to progress to long-term use if receiving 
a prescription in the ED compared to non-ED settings (Figure 2-F).
To determine whether guideline concordant prescriptions were associated with a lower risk 
of progression to long-term use of opioids, we included a binary variable indicating whether 
the prescription met all guidelines in a regression of long-term use. Across nearly all care 
settings and beneficiary populations, a non-concordant prescription was associated with a 
greater risk of progression to long-term opioid use (adjusted risk ratios range from 1.09 
[0.93,1.26] for disabled Medicare beneficiaries treated in the ED to 5.42 [4.79,6.05] for aged 
Medicare beneficiaries seen in unknown settings; full regression results in web appendices. 
All beneficiary/treatment setting comparisons showed statistically significant increases in 
risk except disabled Medicare/ED). See Table 3 for all risk ratios and confidence intervals.
4. Time trends in risk of guideline concordance and long-term use—In every 
year of the study, across all three populations and all measures of guideline concordance, 
prescriptions attributed to the non-ED setting were more likely to exceed guideline limits 
than those attributed to the ED.
The proportion of prescriptions exceeding 3 days or 7 days and the proportion written for 
long-acting formulations were relatively stable over the years of the study. However, the 
proportion of prescriptions written for large doses decreased from 2009 to 2011. In 
prescriptions exceeding 50 MME, this decrease ranged from 20% to 50%, depending on the 
treatment setting and beneficiary population. See web appendices for full details. The 
proportion of prescriptions progressing to long-term opioid use fell over the study period in 
all beneficiary populations and treatment settings. The largest decrease in progression to 
long-term use was in the aged Medicare population seen in the ED, from 2.1% in 2009 to 
1.2% in 2015 (−42%); the smallest decrease was in the Commercial population seen in non-
ED settings, from 2.7% in 2009 to 2.4% in 2015 (−11%).
Limitations
A limitation of this study is the large number of prescriptions for which we were unable to 
assign a likely source. As noted, this issue has been found in a study using a different source 
of commercial claims.33 We estimate that about 7-10% of the prescriptions in this study 
were written by dentists, leaving 5-10% of the prescriptions unexplained. Further research is 
needed to understand whether some of these prescriptions may indicate problematic 
prescribing practices in which a physician writes a prescription without seeing the patient.
The data available in administrative claims does not allow us to attribute prescriptions to 
visits with complete certainty. Our method of attribution uses the information available to 
assign a most likely source of prescriptions.

 This study is limited to prescription fills submitted for insurance payment and to a 
population of commercial and Medicare Advantage beneficiaries. We do not include the 
uninsured, or people with Medicaid or fee-for-service Medicare.
Given our study design, we were unable to evaluate whether the risk of long-term use was 
causally related to the prescription’s guideline concordance. Randomized controlled studies 
are unlikely to meet ethical guidelines for responsible research practice, given the weight of 
evidence on the risks of opioid use. The recent work of Barnett et al. suggests that 
observational studies of provider variability may be a source of quasi-random variation that 
could be used to study the impact of prescription characteristics on patient outcomes.19
The CDC guidelines had not been released during the period we studied. Therefore, this 
study should not be understood as measuring physician adherence to the CDC guidelines, 
but rather as measuring physician practice in reference to evidence guiding best practices in 
prescribing.
Discussion
Compared to non-ED settings, opioid prescriptions provided to opioid naïve patients in the 
ED were more likely to align with CDC recommendations for duration of these prescriptions 
for acute pain. More than 40% of prescriptions filled by disabled Medicare patients seen in 
non-ED settings exceeded 7 days supplied. In contrast, less than 5% of ED-attributed 
prescriptions exceeded 7 days in all three patient populations.
ED prescription durations in our study were similar to those in Weiner et al., which used 
Ohio Prescription Drug Monitoring Program data to study ED prescribing patterns from 
2010 to 2014.40 Observations from this study showed similar rates of prescriptions 
exceeding 3 days to those found in the ED prescriptions in our study: 34% across their study 
period compared to 38% (Commercial), 42% (aged Medicare), and 37% (disabled Medicare) 
in our study.
We expected a small number of prescriptions in excess of 50 or 90 MME to be issued to 
opioid-naïve patients in any setting. These dose levels were selected by the CDC guideline 
writers as high doses for people with some degree of tolerance due to long-term opioid use. 
The high rates of prescriptions exceeding these levels were not anticipated. In non-ED 
settings, one in six prescriptions written for disabled Medicare patients and one in five for 
Commercial patients were for more than 50 MME per day. The rates of prescriptions for 
more than 90 MME per day ranged up to 7% in the Commercial population seen in non-ED 
settings. These high doses prescribed to people with no prior opioids in 6 or more months 
could be considered an indication that the individual had previously taken opioids for a 
similar condition at a similar high dose. However, this may not be a safe practice for the 
majority of patients due in part, to the rapid resolution of opioid tolerance.41,42
As expected, we found low overall rates of prescriptions for LA and ER opioids. However, 
more than 2 percent of prescriptions written for the disabled Medicare population were for 
these formulations. This is a safety concern for opioid naïve patients, as initiating opioid

 treatment with LA or ER formulations increases in the risk of overdose compared to 
immediate-release opioids.43
The rate of continued use seen in this Medicare Advantage population is higher than that 
reported by Barnett et al.19 who followed Medicare Fee-for-Service beneficiaries who were 
opioid naïve in the prior 6 months and received an opioid prescription in the ED. They found 
that 1.2% to 1.5% progressed to long-term use, defined as 180 days supplied in 12 months 
following the initial prescription, but excluding the 30 days after the prescription. More than 
3 percent of our Medicare Advantage beneficiaries seen in the ED progressed to long-term 
use; however, our definition of long-term use was a lower bar than the Barnett definition: 
120 days, rather than 180 days in the Barnett study, and we did not exclude the 30 days after 
the prescription.
Although we didn’t set out to compare guideline concordance across beneficiary 
populations, we found that the disabled Medicare population were more likely to receive 
prescriptions exceeding 3 days and 7 days, and were more likely to receive long-acting 
formulations compared to the aged Medicare and Commercial populations. Future 
investigations comparing these populations are needed.
In conclusion, opioid prescriptions attributed to the ED for opioid-naïve patients were more 
likely to adhere to best practices for opioid prescribing to opioid naïve patients compared to 
those attributed to non-ED settings. ED prescriptions were shorter in duration, written for 
lower doses, and less likely to be for LA or ER formulations. These prescriptions were 
followed by a lower risk of progression to long-term opioid use.
Across all treatment settings and patient populations, guideline concordance was associated 
with a lower risk of long-term use. Among opioid-naïve patients, greater guideline 
concordance in the ED may have been an important driver that helped mitigate the 
progression to long-term opioid use. Future research may explore why ED prescriptions for 
opioid naïve patients are more likely to be guideline concordant, with the hope of replicating 
that success in other settings where opioid naïve patients are treated.

 Figure 2: Risk ratios for outcomes by source of prescription
Risk ratios with non-ED prescription source as the reference category; bars indicate 95% 
confidence intervals. Com=commercial population; Mcr=Medicare; Disab.=Disabled; 
ER=Extended Release. Logistic regression with binary outcomes was performed with 
independent variables representing beneficiary characteristics: beneficiary category 
(Commercial, aged Medicare, disabled Medicare); year of fill (continuous); beneficiary age, 
age-squared, age-cubed; indicators for each Elixhauser comorbidity and whether the 
beneficiary had any medical claims in the 6 months before the fill; female sex; and race/
ethnicity. Adjusted proportions meeting each outcome were calculated for each beneficiary 
group using Stata’s marginal effects commands. Risk ratios were calculated from these 
adjusted proportions, with 95% CIs calculated using Stata’s nlcom command, which uses 
the delta method to produce standard errors.
