Abstract
Background: older adults are frequent users of primary healthcare services, but are at increased risk of healthcare-related
harm in this setting.
Objectives: to describe the factors associated with actual or potential harm to patients aged 65 years and older, treated in
primary care, to identify action to produce safer care.
Design and Setting: a cross-sectional mixed-methods analysis of a national (England and Wales) database of patient safety
incident reports from 2005 to 2013.
Subjects: 1,591 primary care patient safety incident reports regarding patients aged 65 years and older.
Methods: we developed a classification system for the analysis of patient safety incident reports to describe: the incident
and preceding chain of incidents; other contributory factors; and patient harm outcome. We combined findings from
exploratory descriptive and thematic analyses to identify key sources of unsafe care.
Results: the main sources of unsafe care in our weighted sample were due to: medication-related incidents e.g. prescribing,
dispensing and administering (n = 486, 31%; 15% serious patient harm); communication-related incidents e.g. incomplete or
non-transfer of information across care boundaries (n = 390, 25%; 12% serious patient harm); and clinical decision-making
incidents which led to the most serious patient harm outcomes (n = 203, 13%; 41% serious patient harm).
Conclusion: priority areas for further research to determine the burden and preventability of unsafe primary care for older
adults, include: the timely electronic tools for prescribing, dispensing and administering medication in the community; elec-
tronic transfer of information between healthcare settings; and, better clinical decision-making support and guidance.
Keywords: patient safety, quality improvement, older adults, primary care
Introduction
Older adults are frequent users of primary healthcare services
and account for half of all 340 million general practice consul-
tations in the UK each year [1]. Considering 2–3% of all pri-
mary care encounters result in a patient safety incident, with 1
in 25 causing a serious harm outcome [2], 170,000 older
adults each year in the UK may receive care that causes death
or severe adverse, physical or psychological outcomes. The
true frequency and burden of primary healthcare-related
harm to older adults is unknown although several studies sug-
gest they are at increased risk [3–5].

 Estimates of the frequency of unsafe care in hospitals
assess the risk as twice as high for older adults compared to
younger age groups [6, 7]. No comparable work on this
scale has provided estimates of the frequency and nature of
such harm in primary care. Studies have examined patient
safety using different research methods, for example, ana-
lysing routinely collected data (such as adverse drug reac-
tions) for prescribing errors [3] or case note reviews [4].
Trigger tool studies (searching clinical records for relevant
outcomes) have suggested that older adults are at increased
risk of diagnostic and medication-related incidents [5].
Despite recognised limitations of incident reporting,
including under-reporting, selection bias and incomplete
causation, incident reports can provide an important lens
for understanding unsafe care, in terms of what happened
and perceived causes. Given the paucity of existing primary
care safety literature, a structured process for identifying
priorities for improvement from incident reports was
needed. The value of our method has been shown in stud-
ies of systemic causes of safety-related hospital deaths [8],
and to identify the scope for practice improvement in pri-
mary care for vulnerable children [9, 10].
The safety of primary care is an emerging global priority
for healthcare, led by the World Health Organization (WHO)
[11]. This is mirrored in UK policy [12], where there is recog-
nition that vulnerable groups, like older adults, should have
priority attention. Given this global interest [13], and the
complexity of delivering healthcare to an ageing population
[14], it is important to create a better understanding of the
healthcare-related harm experienced by older adults.
Methods
We carried out a cross-sectional, mixed-methods study of a
patient safety incident database with a sample of reports
selected for analysis, known to involve patients 65 years of
age and older. This combined a detailed data coding pro-
cess and iterative generation of data summaries using
descriptive statistical and thematic analysis methods [9].
Data source
Primary data were extracted from the National Reporting
and Learning System (NRLS). This is a database of over 14
million patient safety incident reports from healthcare orga-
nisations in England and Wales. A patient safety incident is
defined as, ‘any unintended or unexpected incident that
could have harmed or did harm a patient during healthcare
delivery’ [15]. Reporting began voluntarily in 2003 but,
since 2010, it has been mandatory to report any incident
that resulted in severe patient harm or death. Since the
inception of the NRLS, reporting arrangements have
included batch returns via local risk management systems,
and more recently in England by direct notification to the
Care Quality Commission (an independent regulator of all
health and social care services in England) as well as direct
reporting to the NRLS. Reports contained structured
information about location, patient demographics and the
reporter’s perception of harm severity, complemented by
unstructured free-text descriptions of the incident, potential
contributory factors and planned actions to prevent reoccur-
rence. The database was described in more detail in a study
of patient safety-related hospital deaths in England [8].
Study population
We have undertaken a sub-analysis of all reports describing
the care of older adults from a larger agenda setting study
for general practice to characterise 13,699 reports [9]. The
period chosen for the study was 1 April 2005–30 September
2013, which was the largest cross section of data available at
the outset of our study. In this time, there were 42,729
reports about incidents occurring in general practice. The
study population was assembled by combining all incident
reports throughout the study period that resulted in severe
harm or death (n = 1,199) with a weighted random sample
of incident reports from 2012 onwards with preference for
more recent and more harmful incidents (no harm n = 6,691,
low harm n = 3,461, moderate harm n = 2,348); described in
detail in our protocol paper [9]. Within the resulting total of
13,699 incident reports, 6,472 (47%) specified the age of the
patient, of which 3,417 (53%) involved patients aged 65 years
and older. Reports were excluded (n = 1,826) if there was
insufficient clinical information (n = 1,417) or because on
detailed scrutiny the incident had not occurred in primary
care (n = 409). The majority of reports with insufficient clin-
ical information described pressure ulcers (n = 1,235). Whilst
pressure ulcers can represent the outcome of poor care, such
reports contained little descriptive or contextual information
(e.g. simply ‘Pressure ulcer, Grade 3’). Other reports were
excluded if, by the NRLS definition, no patient safety incident
had occurred (n = 182). The resulting final study population
was 1,591 incident reports.
Data coding
A small team made up of general practitioners, nurses and
health services researchers was trained in root cause ana-
lysis and human factors in healthcare [9]. This team then
reviewed the free-text component of each incident report
and coded the information in relation to: the primary
patient safety incident that was reported to have directly
affected patient care (e.g. prescribing incident) and the
chain of incidents leading up to the safety incident (e.g.
miscommunication between staff); the contributory factors
(e.g. staff knowledge) and reported patient harm outcomes
with harm severity classified from the free-text report
according to WHO International Classification for Patient
Safety definitions [16]. A random sample of 20% of the
reports was double-coded. All discordance between coders
were discussed to ensure correct interpretation of codes
and their definitions. Difficult cases were discussed at
weekly team meetings and a third, senior investigator (A.

The

been
described in more detail [9].
Data analyses
We undertook an exploratory descriptive analysis to assess
the most frequent and most harmful primary incident types
in the sample, the associated chain of incidents, and other
contributory factors. We used thematic analysis to identify
and describe recurring themes (not captured by the quan-
titative data) that could be targeted to mitigate future
similar incidents. The most commonly identified causes
and potential interventions, suggested by the reporter or
the experience of the team, were summarised in a driver
diagram. This is a quality improvement tool that has pre-
viously been used by our team to summarise priority areas
for change and mapping potential interventions [17]. We
also carried out literature searches to determine whether
existing interventions or initiatives for promoting patient
safety had been described in each area. When available,
the strength of each intervention was graded using the US
Department of Veterans Affairs classification, where the
strongest designs are permanent and physical rather than
temporary and procedural [18].
Ethical approval
Aneurin Bevan (Gwent, Wales, UK) University Health
Board’s Research Risk Review Committee judged the study
as using anonymised data for service improvement pur-
poses and approved it on this basis (ABHB R&D Ref num-
ber: SA/410/13).
Results
Just over half of the incident reports included in our weighted
sample described patient harm (n = 921/1,591, 58%). In 270
(17%) reports, this was described as a serious harm resulting in
hospital admission, permanent injury or death (Table 1). The
three main sources of harm were due to: medication-related
incidents (e.g. prescribing, dispensing and administering; n =
486, 31%; 15% serious patient harm); communication-related
incidents (e.g. incomplete or non-transfer of information across
care boundaries; n = 390, 25%; 12% serious patient harm) and
clinical decision-making incidents which led to the most serious
patient harm outcomes (n = 203, 13%; 41% serious patient
harm) (Tables 1 and 2).
Medication-related incidents
One-third of reports in our weighted sample involved medi-
cation incidents (n = 486, 31%). This was mainly due to: pre-
scribing errors involving the wrong drug or dosage (n = 180/
486, 37%; Table 2, Example 1); administering medication at
the wrong dose or time (n = 126/486, 26%; Table 2,
Example 2) and dispensing errors including the wrong drug
or wrong strength dispensed (n = 83/486, 17%; Table 2,
Example 3). Other incidents included failure of drug monitor-
ing processes (e.g. warfarin; Table 2, Example 4).
A fifth of the reports in our sample described a
communication-related incident in the preceding chain of
events (n = 88/486, 18%), often involving incomplete or
delayed transfer of written information across care bound-
aries. Independent contributory factors were identified at:
the staff level such as mistakes between ‘look-alike’ and

 ‘sound-alike’ drugs (n = 122/274, 45%); the system level
such as protocols for drug dispensing (n = 87/274, 32%);
and at the patient level such as multi-morbidity (n = 65/
274, 23%). Some reports described how incidents were
mitigated by an advocate (Table 2, Example 5).
Communication-related incidents
A quarter of reports in our weighted sample (n = 390,
25%) described a communication-related incident as the
incident that led to direct harm. These were largely due to:
the referral process within the multidisciplinary team and
across healthcare boundaries (n = 181/390, 46%); and
delays or failures to transfer essential information about the
patient between healthcare settings (n = 209/390, 54%).
A missed or delayed referral by the healthcare professional
was the most common referral process incident in our sample
(n = 86/181, 48%; Table 2, Example 6), whilst other reports
mentioned referrals sent to the wrong service or lacking key
information (n = 45/181, 24%). Administrative level referral
incidents were also described including referrals being sent to
the wrong place (n = 50/181, 28%; Table 2, Example 7).
Key information regarding diagnoses or medication changes
was often missing in communication following inpatient
admissions or outpatient consultations which in some inci-
dents led to severe patient harm (Table 2, Examples 8–10).
Over half the identified contributory factors in our sam-
ple were at the system level, such as the use of fax machines
and handwritten communication (n = 116/221, 52%). Staff
factors such as forgetting to make the referral accounted

 for over a quarter (n = 61/221, 28%), whilst patient factors
such as lack of knowledge of the treatment plan were
responsible for a further fifth (n = 44/221, 20%).
Clinical decision-making incidents
Whilst only 13% (n = 203) of reports in our weighted sample
contained clinical decision-making incidents, a larger propor-
tion of these (n = 83/203, 41%) led to serious patient harm
compared with other incident types (n = 187/1,388, 13%).
The reports described assessment errors (n = 98/203, 48%)
and inappropriate treatment decisions (n = 105/203, 52%). A
misdiagnosis was described in 59/203 (29%) reports, includ-
ing 21 reports describing a delayed cancer diagnosis.
As with the medication incidents, a fifth of the reports in
our sample described a communication incident in the preced-
ing chain of events (n = 36/203, 18%). A tenth described pre-
ceding delayed or misinterpreted results (n = 23/203, 11%;
Table 2, Examples 11–13). Contributing patient factors were
commoner in this incident type than others (n = 45/131,
34%) and included symptoms which could be attributed to
existing morbidity (Table 2, Example 14). The complex man-
agement of multi-morbidity and lack of guidance also featured.
Staff factors were described in a third of reports in this sample
(n = 40/131, 31%) and included misinterpreting investigation
results. System factors (n = 46/131, 35%) such as deficiencies
in investigation follow-up protocols were also evident.
Driver diagram
Our findings are mapped onto a driver diagram and high-
light three main sources of unsafe care as the priority areas
for change identified from these reports (Figure 1).
Discussion
Our study is the largest examination of the pattern of
unsafe primary care delivered to older adults [9]. We drew
on the largest database of patient safety incident reports in
the world. We used a detailed coding and exploratory ana-
lytical process, developed specifically for primary care, to
enable an evaluation of the main sources and underlying
factors potentially influencing the safety of care.
From this weighted sample of reports involving older
adults being treated in primary care settings, we found that
incidents were most commonly due to one of three inad-
equate processes: inappropriate medication provision; com-
munication failures across care boundaries; and errors in
clinical decision-making. Whilst a fifth of reports in our
sample described a serious patient harm outcome, scrutiny
of the descriptions in the remainder of reports suggested
that many could have escalated into more serious outcomes
if healthcare professionals or relatives had not intervened.
The limitations of this study included that inferences
from our data are essentially inductive, owing to the selection
bias in submission of reports to the NRLS, and also cannot
be viewed as representative or generalisable since our sam-
pling strategy prioritised most recent and harmful incidents.
However, analysis of safety incidents identified by healthcare
professionals can provide insight into what happened and
the perceived causes unlike other research methods. Our
structured process to characterise the most frequent and
harmful incident types from a large volume of data highlights
areas of action to improve patient safety in older adults. The
literature searches complement these findings, but full sys-
tematic reviews may have described other interventions.
This study highlights how dependent older adults are on

 essential information regarding their care. Human factors
such as misread drug names and system weaknesses such as
poor communication systems or inadequate protocols were
more commonly described to contribute to the incidents
than patient-related factors such as multi-morbidity and poly-
pharmacy. The safety of primary care for older adults could
be improved by permanent system-level interventions, par-
ticularly those that seek to minimise human factor-related
causes of harm (Figure 1) [18].
Timely electronic transfer of information with standardised
formats and forcing functions [19], may consequently reduce
medication and clinical decision-making incidents. Electronic,
evidence-based alerts could reduce inappropriate prescribing
[20], whilst expanded use of electronic or bar-code drug
administration in community settings could tackle other sources
of drug administration incidents [21]. ‘Look-alike’ and ‘sound-
alike’ medicine solutions to prevent dispensing and administra-
tion incidents needs further research and may include: tall man
lettering; electronic dispensing alerts and barcode scanners [22].
National or global polices to introduce these initiatives could
improve the safety of primary care for older adults.
Previous studies have described other potential solutions
to prevent medication incidents. These include ‘deprescribing’
to address polypharmacy and declining physiological function
in older adults; [23] here, shared decision-making, including
family or carer advocates, can play a pivotal role [24].
Validated medication review tools are available to assist this
process [25], which can include pharmacists [26]. Emerging
technology that permits community-based point of care test-
ing is reducing unsafe anticoagulation [27], and could be
expanded to other therapeutic agents.
New multidisciplinary community-based care models
with improved access to specialist geriatric advice may
improve complex clinical decision-making and management
of multi-morbidity in older adults, thereby reducing the
harm associated with these areas that our study has identi-
fied [28, 29]. Local protocols within the multidisciplinary
team need to ensure an effective system of investigation
result follow-up [30], especially for those patients unable to
take ownership of their own results.
Conclusion
Priority areas for further research to determine the burden
and preventability of unsafe primary care for older adults,
include: the timely electronic transfer of information between
healthcare settings; electronic tools for prescribing, dispens-
ing and administering medication in the community; and,
better clinical decision-making support and guidance.
Key points
• Older adults are at risk of health-care-related harm in pri-
mary care settings.
• The main sources of unsafe care identified from analysis
of patient safety incident reports were due to medication-
related incidents, communication-related incidents, and
clinical decision-related incidents.
• Further research is needed in these priority areas to
improve the safety of primary care for older adults.
