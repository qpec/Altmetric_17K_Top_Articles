IMPORTANCE Differences in cardiovascular autonomic activity between individuals with
psychiatric disorders and healthy controls have been observed, but whether cardiovascular
autonomic abnormalities are associated with subsequent psychiatric disorders is unknown.
OBJECTIVE To investigate whether differences in cardiac autonomic function as indexed by
resting heart rate and blood pressure are associated with psychiatric disorders during the
lifetime of men in Sweden.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We conducted a longitudinal register-based study of
Swedish men whose resting heart rate (n = 1 039 443) and blood pressure (n = 1 555 979)
were measured at military conscription at a mean (SD) age of 18.3 (0.6) years during the
period from 1969 to 2010, with register-based follow-up data available until the end of 2013.
Analyses were performed from November 18, 2015, to June 9, 2016.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Dates of inpatient/outpatient diagnoses of anxiety
disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, depressive
disorders, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and substance use disorders and convictions for
violent crimes, between 1973 and 2013, were obtained from nationwide registers.
Adjustments were made for height, weight, body mass index, cardiorespiratory fitness,
cognitive ability, and socioeconomic covariates.
RESULTS After adjustment for covariates, Cox regression models with up to 45 years of
follow-up data showed that men (mean [SD] age of 18.3 [0.6] years at conscription) with
resting heart rates above 82 beats per minute had a 69% (95% CI, 46%-94%) increased risk
for obsessive-compulsive disorder, a 21% (95% CI, 11%-33%) increased risk for schizophrenia,
and an 18% (95% CI, 13%-22%) increased risk for anxiety disorders compared with men with
resting heart rates below 62 beats per minute. Similar associations were observed with
systolic/diastolic blood pressure. In contrast, lower resting heart rate and lower systolic blood
pressure were associated with substance use disorders and violent criminality.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Our results suggest that for men, differences in heart rate and
blood pressure in late adolescence are associated with lifetime major psychiatric disorders,
with higher levels associated with obsessive-compulsive disorder, schizophrenia, and anxiety
disorders and lower levels associated with substance use disorders and violent behavior.
Differences in autonomic nervous system functioning may predate or represent an early
marker of psychiatric disorders.

The resting heart rate (RHR) is an easy-to-measure clinical
variableindexingcardiacautonomicnervoussystemactivity6and
isknowntopredictthehealthandlifespanofanindividual.7-9In
contrast to the confirmed associations with somatic health, the
link between RHR and psychiatric problems is less clear. An ac-
celerated heart rate during panic attacks is a core symptom of
panicdisorder,andanelevatedRHRinpatientswithschizophre-
nia was suggested already in early studies.10 More recent stud-
ies have reported an elevated RHR in patients with major
depression,11posttraumaticstressdisorder,12,13generalizedanxi-

thesesuggestivefindings,studieshaveoftenbeenlimitedbysmall
andselectedsamples,andtheassociationsbetweenRHRanddif-
ferentpsychiatricdisordershavenotbeenstudiedsystematically.
Besides RHR, alterations in blood pressure (BP), regu-
lated by the autonomic nervous system as a function of
cardiac output and vascular resistance,17 have been observed
in patients with schizophrenia,5 anxiety,18,19 or depression.20
However, the results have been inconsistent, with some stud-
ies reporting higher BP and others reporting lower BP. Fur-
thermore, the findings may have been partly due to the ad-
verse effects of medication.20
Theobservedcardiacautonomicabnormalitiesareoftenas-
sumed to be induced by psychiatric problems. Psychiatric dis-
orders increase the risk for cardiovascular morbidity and
mortality,21-23 and altered autonomic functioning has been hy-
pothesizedtomediatetheassociation.23,24However,becauseau-
tonomic functions are intrinsically involved in emotions,25 it is
alsopossiblethatautonomicactivityprecedespsychopathology
ratherthanviceversa.Whilecross-sectionalcomparisonsofpsy-
chiatric patients and healthy controls have been typical, some
prospective longitudinal studies have been published. For ex-
ample,depressivesymptomswereassociatedwithahigherRHR
and a lower heart rate variability in men26 and with a low BP in
the elderly,27 and a low heart rate variability before military de-
ploymentwasassociatedwithposttraumaticstressdisorderaf-
ter exposure to combat.28 In a subset of the current cohort, we
foundthatalowerRHRinlateadolescencewasassociatedwith
subsequent violent and nonviolent antisocial behavior.29
In this large-scale cohort study, we aimed to investigate
whether differences in autonomic function as indexed by RHR
and BP were associated with psychiatric disorders during the
lifetimes of men in Sweden. Using population-based register
data of men with a follow-up period of up to 45 years, we stud-
ied the associations of RHR and BP in late adolescence with
diagnoses of major psychiatric disorders later in life.
Methods
Study Population
We linked several Swedish national registers with longitudi-
naldataavailableuntiltheendof2013.Auniquepersonaliden-
tification number, given to all citizens at birth, was used for
the register linkages. Resting heart rate and BP were mea-
sured during a 2-day conscription assessment for the Swed-
ish Armed Forces, mandatory until 2010 for Swedish men at
18 years of age. Only men with severe diseases, handicaps, or
intellectual disability were exempt, and more than 95% of the
men generally attended the conscription assessment.30 We
combined information from the Total Population Register and
the Conscription Register to identify men who were born in
Sweden and conscripted during the register’
s coverage pe-
riod from 1969 to 2010 (N = 1 840 911). To enable linkage with
parentaldata,weidentifiedtheparentsofeachindividualfrom
the Multi-Generation Register,31 and those with missing in-
formation on parents’identity were excluded (n = 28 759). In-
formation about emigrations and deaths was available from
the Migration Register and the Cause of Death Register, re-
spectively. We excluded men who had emigrated from Swe-
den before conscription (n = 17 791). The total study popula-
tion thus included 1 794 361 conscripted men. The study was
approved by the Regional Ethical Review Board of Stock-
holm, Sweden. No informed consent was required for the
register-based study because the participants were not ap-
proached personally.
RHR and BP Measurements
Resting heart rate and BP were measured while the indi-
vidual was in the supine position, with an appropriate cuff at
heart level after 5 to 10 minutes of rest during the conscrip-
tion examination.32 Similar to our earlier study,29 we
excluded as outliers or potential data errors RHR measure-
ments below 35 and above 145 beats per minute (n = 172),
systolic BP (SBP) measurements below 80 and above 180 mm
Hg (n = 503), and diastolic BP (DBP) measurements below 40
and above 100 mm Hg (n = 1434). Possibly owing to changes
in the registering procedures, RHR measurements were
almost completely missing from the Conscription Register for
the years from 1984 to 1993, and data coverage varied also
during other periods. A valid RHR measurement was avail-
able for 1 039 443 men, a valid SBP measurement was avail-
able for 1 555 979 men, and a valid DBP measurement was
available for 1 554 829 men.
Key Points
Question Are differences in cardiac autonomic function
(as indexed by resting heart rate and blood pressure) associated
with subsequent psychiatric disorders?
Findings In this longitudinal cohort study of more than 1 million
men in Sweden, a higher resting heart rate in late adolescence was
associated with an increased risk for subsequent
obsessive-compulsive disorder, schizophrenia, and anxiety
disorders, whereas a lower resting heart rate in late adolescence
was associated with an increased risk for substance use disorders
and violent criminality. Similar associations were observed with
systolic/diastolic blood pressure.
Meaning Differences in autonomic nervous system functioning
may predate or represent an early marker of psychiatric disorders.

Psychiatric Disorders
The National Patient Register contains information about all
psychiatric inpatient admissions in Sweden since 1973 and all
outpatient treatments since 2001.33 Diagnoses were made by
the attending physician according to Swedish translations of
the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) revisions 8
(1969-1986), 9 (1987-1996), or 10 (1997-present). We studied
7 categories of major psychiatric disorders: anxiety disorders
(ICD-10 codes F40, F41, F44, F45, and F48), obsessive-
compulsivedisorder(OCD)(codeF42),posttraumaticstressdis-
order(codeF43),depressivedisorders(codesF32-F34,F38,and
F39), bipolar disorder (codes F30 and F31), schizophrenia (in-
cludingschizoaffectivedisorder)(codesF20andF25),andsub-
stance use disorders (SUDs) (codes F10-F19). The validity of
psychiatric diagnoses in the National Patient Register is gen-
erally good.33,34 We also included violent criminal convic-
tions from the Swedish Crime Register as an indicator of an-
tisocial behavior. Full ICD codes and a description of violent
convictions are given in eTable 1 in the Supplement.
Covariates
Weincludedseveralpotentialconfoundersascovariates.Height,
weight, and body mass index were included because they may
beassociatedwithbothcardiovascularfunctioningandtherisk
for mental disorders.35 We adjusted for general cognitive abil-
ity(IQ),assessedwiththeSwedishEnlistmentBattery30 aspart
of the conscription testing, because IQ is associated with psy-
chiatric morbidity,36 although its association with RHR and BP
isunknown.BecausedifferencesinRHRandBPexistamongdif-
ferent ethnic groups, and because immigration may be associ-
ated with an altered risk for mental disorders, we adjusted for
parental immigrant status. The family’
s socioeconomic status
during the man’
s childhood, available from National Censuses
in 1960, 1970, 1980, 1985, and 1990, was also included owing
to its possible associations with psychopathology and cardio-
vascularmeasures.37Thesocioeconomicstatusvariablewasde-
rived from the occupation of the head of the household and
coded into 3 classes: low (skilled and unskilled workers across
all fields), medium (low- and intermediate-position white col-
lar workers), and high (high-position white collar workers and
self-employed professionals and entrepreneurs). Because RHR
andBPnegativelycorrelatewithphysicalfitness,whichmaybe
associated with psychiatric disorders, we adjusted for maximal
workload(Wmax,measuredinwatts)achievedinanexercisetest
with a cycle ergometer during the conscription testing.38 Wmax
wasavailableforasubsetof1306369men(782545withanRHR
measurement). The Wmax value was divided by weight to take
intoaccountbodysize.Finally,weincludedbirthandconscrip-
tion years to adjust for potential cohort and period effects.
Statistical Methods
We constructed Cox proportional hazards regression models to
estimate the relative hazards of receiving diagnoses of psychi-
atricdisordersandbeingconvictedofviolentcrimesduringthe
follow-up period starting from conscription. In separate mod-
els,wefollowedtheparticipantsuntilthefirstoccurrenceofeach
outcome(ie,firstdiagnosisofeachpsychiatricdisorderandfirst
conviction for a violent offense). Men with psychiatric diagno-
ses or violent convictions predating conscription were ex-
cluded from the respective models. Those for whom the stud-
ied outcome did not occur within the study period contributed
person-timeatriskuntiltheendoffollow-up(endof2013),emi-
gration, or death, whichever occurred first.
As main analyses, we constructed Cox regression models
for each outcome using variables denoting 10-unit increases
in RHR, SBP, and DBP, as well as with quintile categoriza-
tions. We chose quintiles as an illustrative way to analyze the
associations while allowing for potential nonlinearity. The first
model only adjusted for birth and conscription years. The sec-
ond model added all covariates with the exception of cardio-
respiratory fitness, and the third model also adjusted for fit-
ness in the subset of men with exercise test data.
Nonindependence of brothers was adjusted for by using a ro-
bust sandwich estimator for standard errors. Graphical inspec-
tion of the Schoenfeld residuals for RHR, SBP, and DBP re-
vealed no violations of the proportional hazards assumption.
We conducted several sensitivity analyses to ensure the
validity of our results. First, to ensure that the results for the
different psychiatric disorders were not due to comorbidi-
ties, we included each disorder only if it was the first-
occurring psychiatric diagnosis for the participant, censoring
men with other predating diagnoses at the date of the first di-
agnosis. Second, to rule out the potential effects of preexist-
ing cardiovascular conditions, we excluded men with any di-

agnoses of cardiovascular diseases (ICD-8/9 codes 390-469;
ICD-10 codes I00-I99) before conscription (n = 8551). Third,
to reduce the likelihood that the observed associations would
be caused by acute psychopathology at the time of measure-
ment, we began follow-up 5 years after conscription. Fourth,
to reduce bias due to potential unobserved disorders among
the older cohorts (ie, men conscripted before the start of the
National Patient Register on January 1, 1973), we repeated the
models with follow-up starting in 1973. Fifth, because the va-
lidity of ICD-8/9 diagnoses in the National Patient Register may
be less optimal, we reran the models among men conscripted
during the period from 1997 to 2010 (n = 474 750) with ICD-10
diagnoses only. Sixth, to inspect potential bias caused by pe-
riods with low coverage of RHR data, we reanalyzed the asso-
ciations using only data from years with more complete cov-
erage. Finally, we tested whether listwise deletion of missing
values in covariates might have biased the results by investi-
gating the crude associations among individuals without miss-
ing data on covariates.
Statistical significance was assessed using 95% CIs in Cox
regression models. Whenever the 95% CI covered the null, the
associationwasconsiderednonsignificant;wheneveritdidnot,
the association was considered significant.

The quintiles of resting heart rate were as follows: 35 to 61 beats per minutes for
the first quintile, 62 to 68 beats per minutes for the second quintile, 69 to 74
beats per minutes for the third quintile, 75 to 82 beats per minutes for the
fourth quintile, and 83 to 145 beats per minutes for the fifth quintile. Resting
heart rate was measured at a mean (SD) age of 18.3 (0.6) years at conscription
testing. Follow-up started at conscription and lasted until the first diagnosis of
each disorder, emigration, death, or end of register coverage (December 31,
2013), whichever came first.

Associations of RHR and BP With Psychiatric
Disorders and Violence
Table 2 gives an overview of the results from the Cox regres-
sion models, showing hazard ratios associated with 10-unit in-
creasesinRHR,SBP,andDBP.Inthebasemodelsadjustingonly
for birth and conscription years, every 10-unit increase in RHR
was associated with an 8% (95% CI, 7%-9%) increased risk for
anxiety disorders, 18% (95% CI, 15%-21%) increased risk for
OCD, 5% (95% CI, 4%-6%) increased risk for depression, and
10% (95% CI, 8%-12%) increased risk for schizophrenia, as well
as a 6% (95% CI, 5%-6%) reduced risk for violent criminality.
The associations were weakened when adjusting for the co-
variates but remained significantly different from unity. Simi-
lar results emerged for the BP measurements; for example, a
10-unit increase in DBP was associated with elevated risks for
anxiety (hazard ratio, 1.06 [95% CI, 1.05-1.07]), OCD (hazard
ratio, 1.11 [95% CI, 1.08-1. 15]), and schizophrenia (hazard ra-
tio, 1.11 [95% CI, 1.08-1.13]) in fully adjusted models.
The results for RHR quintiles concurred with the previous
analysis;ahigherRHRwasmoststronglyassociatedwithanel-
evatedriskforOCD(Table3).Inthefullyadjustedanalysis,men
whose RHR was above 82 beats per minute had a 69% (95% CI,
46%-94%) increased risk for OCD compared with men whose
RHRwasbelow62beatsperminute.Similarly,meninthehigh-
estRHRcategoryhada21%(95%CI,11%-33%)increasedriskfor
schizophrenia and an 18% (95% CI, 13%-22%) increased risk for
anxiety. Substance use disorders and violent convictions were
associated with a lower RHR, especially after adjustment for
physicalfitness.TheassociationsforOCD,schizophrenia,anxi-
ety, SUDs, and violence were generally replicated with the BP
measurements (eTables 5 and 6 in the Supplement).
Sensitivity Analyses
We found no significant bias due to the various tested factors
for our main results (eTables 7 and 8 in the Supplement). Ex-
cluding men with comorbid psychiatric diagnoses or cardio-
vascular diseases before conscription did not reduce the as-
sociations of higher RHR and DBP with anxiety, OCD, and
schizophrenia. Similarly, starting the follow-up only 5 years af-
ter conscription had no effect on the associations. When only
ICD-10 diagnoses were included, the results were commen-
suratewiththemainanalyses,althoughtheestimateswerenot
as precise because of the reduced follow-up period and sample
size.Finally,theassociationsamongmenwithoutmissingdata
on covariates closely resembled those among all men.
Discussion
Inthislarge-scalelongitudinalcohortstudy,wefoundmenwith
higher RHR and higher BP in late adolescence to be more likely
to have received a diagnosis of OCD, schizophrenia, or anxiety
disorder later in life. The strongest associations were seen with
OCD;meninthehighestfifthoftheRHRdistribution(RHR > 82
beats per minute) had a 70% to 80% increased risk in analyses
withvaryingadjustmentscomparedwithmeninthelowestfifth
(RHR < 62 beats per minute). Similarly, men with the highest
DBP (>77 mm Hg) had a 30% to 40% higher risk for OCD than
men with the lowest DBP (<60 mm Hg). For schizophrenia and
anxiety disorders, the corresponding risk increases ranged be-
tween 20% and 40%. These effect sizes are comparable to the
establishedassociationsofRHRwithcardiovasculardiseaseand
mortality;ameta-analysislinkedRHRgreaterthan80beatsper
minute with a 45% increased risk for all-cause mortality and a
33% increased risk for cardiovascular mortality,7 and an analy-
sis of 3 prospective cohort studies found RHR above 72 beats
per minute to increase the risk of incident heart failure by 30%
after adjustments.8 Our findings are novel; there are no previ-
ous prospective studies linking these cardiovascular measures
to subsequent OCD, schizophrenia, or anxiety disorders.
We also found that the risk for SUDs and antisocial behav-
ior was predicted by lower RHR and SBP, especially when ad-
justing for the confounding effect of physical fitness. While we
are unaware of studies on SUDs, we previously reported in a
subset of the present data the association of lower RHR with
violent and nonviolent criminality, as well as assaults and un-

intentional injuries.29 Four additional years of follow-up were
available for the present analyses.
Our results from a prospective design excluding men
with prior psychiatric diagnoses suggest that altered cardiac
autonomic activity may precede or represent an early marker
for a range of psychiatric disorders in men. While heart rate
and BP are influenced by both branches of the autonomic
nervous system, parasympathetic influences dominate in
resting conditions.6 Our findings are thus compatible with
earlier findings indicating reductions in parasympathetic
function in anxiety disorders and schizophrenia.3,6 We
extend these earlier observations into a longitudinal design
considering autonomic activity as a potential predictor of
psychiatric morbidity. While our findings clearly cannot
establish causality, they are compatible with an association
between altered autonomic activity and subsequent psychi-
atric problems. This contrasts with the often hypothesized
opposite direction.23,24
Our results may also be interpreted as reflecting potential
underlying domains of psychopathology. One interpretation
isprovidedbyalteredautonomicfunctioningbeinglinkedwith
neuroticism,39 which is an important precursor of psychiat-
ric illness. Similarly, the temperament trait behavioral inhibi-
tionisassociatedwithelevatedRHRandotherautonomicmea-
sures in childhood,40 and is predictive of future anxiety
disorders.41 Importantly, the cortical and subcortical brain re-
gions involved in autonomic processing include the amyg-
dala, insula, and cingulate cortex, all of which play a role in
emotion processing and have been linked to psychiatric
morbidity.42 Our results are also potentially interesting for
transdiagnostic models of psychopathology such as the Re-
search Domain Criteria.43 In the Research Domain Criteria ma-
trix, heart rate and BP serve as indicators for 2 separate con-
structs: acute threat (“fear”) and arousal. Our findings
prospectively link the elevated levels on these suggested di-
mensions to the ICD-based diagnoses of OCD, schizophrenia,
and anxiety disorders and prospectively link the lower levels
to SUDs and antisocial behavior. This fits well with theoreti-
cal accounts taking low RHR in antisocial individuals to indi-
cate fearlessness or chronically low arousal.29,44 Similarly, el-
evated levels of fear and/or arousal in individuals with OCD,
anxiety, or schizophrenia are consistent with the clinical pre-
sentation of these disorders.
The included physical, cognitive, and socioeconomic co-
variateshadonlymarginaleffectsontheassociations,whereas
poorer cardiorespiratory fitness partly accounted for the links
between higher RHR and psychiatric morbidity. Mental disor-
ders are associated with less physical activity and poorer
fitness,5 and fitness correlates negatively with RHR.45 Also, in
our data, RHR and cardiorespiratory fitness were modestly
negatively correlated (ρ = −0.25 [95% CI, −0.26 to −0.25]).
The interpretation of our findings must be considered in
light of several limitations. First, our study only included
data on men, and it is uncertain whether our findings are
generalizable to women. Compared with men, women have
a higher heart rate but show relatively greater parasympa-
thetic control of the heart.46 While these differences are
poorly understood, they imply that associations between
RHR and psychiatric disorders may be different in men and
women. Second, many psychiatric disorders have their onset
in childhood or early adolescence, including OCD and anxi-
ety disorders.47 We excluded men with registered diagnoses
before conscription at an average age of 18 years, but
because seeking treatment typically occurs much later than
the onset of symptoms, our results may partly reflect symp-
tomatic disorders already present during conscription but
invisible in medical register data. Thus, rather than repre-
senting true risk factors, we may have uncovered early mark-
ers for the persistence of mental disorders. However, we
tried to exclude potential acute psychopathology by starting
the follow-up period only 5 years after conscription, which
had no effect on the associations. Third, while we controlled
for several important covariates, it is possible that residual
confounding due to unmeasured factors contributed to the
results. Finally, our measures of autonomic activity, RHR
and BP, were not optimal, and we did not have more detailed
measures (such as heart rate variability) available. However,
our results with the relatively simple measures should moti-
vate future prospective longitudinal studies with more infor-
mative indicators to investigate autonomic precursors of
psychiatric disorders.
Conclusions
In a large and representative sample of men, higher RHR and
BP in late adolescence were associated with subsequent diag-
noses of OCD, schizophrenia, and anxiety disorders, whereas
lower RHR and BP were associated with subsequent diagno-
ses of SUDs and violent criminality. These associations should
be confirmed in other longitudinal studies, and the underly-
ing mechanisms should be studied with more detailed mea-
sures of autonomic functioning and designs that can more
clearly elucidate causal processes.
