Abstract
Background: Pharmacologic stress ulcer prophylaxis (SUP) is recommended in critically ill patients with high risk of
stress-related gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. However, as to patients receiving enteral feeding, the preventive effect
of SUP is not well-known. Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate
the effect of pharmacologic SUP in enterally fed patients on stress-related GI bleeding and other clinical outcomes.
Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane database from inception through 30 Sep 2017. Eligible
trials were RCTs comparing pharmacologic SUP to either placebo or no prophylaxis in enterally fed patients in the ICU.
Results were expressed as risk ratio (RR) and mean difference (MD) with accompanying 95% confidence interval (CI).
Heterogeneity, subgroup analysis, sensitivity analysis and publication bias were explored.
Results: Seven studies (n = 889 patients) were included. There was no statistically significant difference in GI bleeding
(RR 0.80; 95% CI, 0.49 to 1.31, p = 0.37) between groups. This finding was confirmed by further subgroup analyses and
sensitivity analysis. In addition, SUP had no effect on overall mortality (RR 1.21; 95% CI, 0.94 to 1.56, p = 0.14), Clostridium
difficile infection (RR 0.89; 95% CI, 0.25 to 3.19, p = 0.86), length of stay in the ICU (MD 0.04 days; 95% CI, −0.79 to 0.87,
p = 0.92), duration of mechanical ventilation (MD −0.38 days; 95% CI, −1.48 to 0.72, p = 0.50), but was associated with
an increased risk of hospital-acquired pneumonia (RR 1.53; 95% CI, 1.04 to 2.27; p = 0.03).
Conclusions: Our results suggested that in patients receiving enteral feeding, pharmacologic SUP is not beneficial and
combined interventions may even increase the risk of nosocomial pneumonia.

Background
Over the past decades, stress-related bleeding has become
extremely
uncommon
in
intensive
care
unit
(ICU)
patients [1]. Apart from pharmacologic approaches for
stress ulcer prophylaxis (SUP), advances in the care of
critically ill patients, such as optimal fluid resuscitation to
maintain
hemodynamic
stability
and
thus
improve
splanchnic perfusion, and early provision of enteral
nutrition (EN), may contribute to this observation [2–4].
Although recommended only in patients on mechanical
ventilation or coagulopathy, patients with traumatic brain
injury or major burns, or those with ≥ 2 risk factors [5, 6],
SUP is still being used in nearly 90% of ICU patients,
despite lack of an accepted indication in the majority [7–
9]. Furthermore, SUP is often continued in these patients
until clinical improvement, or even after transfer to the
general ward [1, 10]. However, SUP is not without risks.
The extensive use of SUP has been demonstrated to be as-
sociated
with
a
higher
rate
of
hospital-acquired
pneumonia (HAP) due to loss of the protective bacterio-
static effect of gastric acid [4, 11]. Meanwhile, concomi-
tant treatment of SUP and broad-spectrum antibiotics has
also contributed to higher risks of Clostridium difficile
infection [12, 13]. Thus, selection of potentially high-risk
patients who may benefit from SUP while avoiding
unnecessary use in others is important.

 Some earlier studies reported that EN alone might
provide
sufficient
prophylaxis
against
stress-related
gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding [3, 14]. In animal models,
enteral feeding is documented to increase GI blood flow
and provide protection against GI bleeding [15, 16]. In a
prospective, open-label trial, continuous EN was shown
more likely than proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) or hista-
mine 2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs) to raise gastric pH
to above 3.5, suggesting that EN might be more effective
in preventing GI bleeding than pharmacologic SUP [17].
Although several recent systematic reviews have com-
paratively evaluated pharmacologic agents for SUP, few
of these studies have specialized in patients received EN
[4,
18–20].
In
2010,
one
meta-analysis
comparing
H2RAs to placebo or no prophylaxis for SUP looked into
a subgroup of enterally fed patients. In this subgroup,
SUP did not decrease the risk of bleeding, and in con-
trast led to more episodes of hospital-acquired pneumo-
nia (HAP) and higher mortality rate [4]. However, these
findings were based on an evaluation of only 262 pa-
tients in three randomized controlled trials (RCTs)
(three trials in GI bleeding, two trials in HAP and mor-
tality), which were published between the years 1985
and 1994 and compared H2RAs with placebo [21–23].
In addition, two out of the three RCTs were unblinded
[21, 22], and some of potentially important outcomes to
clinicians or patients, including duration of mechanical
ventilation, incidence of C. difficile infection, ventilator-
associated pneumonia (VAP) and length of ICU stay
were not considered in this meta-analysis.
Therefore, in order to address these limitations, we
sought to expand the previous meta-analysis by adding
relevant RCTs published between 1994 and 2017, and
including any prophylaxis regimens. We reviewed these
RCTs to determine if there are differences between
pharmacologic SUP and placebo or no prophylaxis in
enterally fed patients in terms of stress ulcer-related GI
bleeding, and other clinical outcomes.
Methods
Search strategy and selection criteria
This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted
in accordance with the PRISMA guidance [24]. We
searched RCTs in PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane
database from inception to 30 Sep 2017 to identify po-
tentially relevant studies.
A population, intervention, comparator and outcomes
assessment based on question and literature search was
created (Additional file 1: S1). Our research was limited to
RCTs and no language restriction was applied. Reference
lists of included articles and other systematic review and
meta-analysis were also reviewed. We included studies
that met the following criteria: (1) design - RCTs; (2)
population - adult (≥18 years old) ICU patients receiving
EN; (3) intervention - patients receiving any pharmaco-
logic SUP, regardless of dosage, frequency and duration;
(4) control - patients receiving placebo or no prophylaxis;
(5) predefined outcomes - GI bleeding, overall mortality at
the longest available follow up, HAP, length of ICU stay,
duration
of
mechanical
ventilation
and
C.
difficile
infection. To facilitate comparison with the previous
meta-analysis by Marik et al. [4], we required included
studies
to
specifically
report
that > 50%
of
enrolled
patients received EN [4]. We excluded studies enrolling
patients who were < 18 years old, using SUP due to active
bleeding or increased risk of bleeding, or receiving
palliative care and publications available only in abstract
form or meeting reports. Studies with inadequate informa-
tion about enteral feeding were also excluded. We
contacted the authors if the data on predefined outcomes
from their studies were required.
Data extraction and quality assessment
Two reviewers (H-BH and W J) independently extracted
data from included studies, such as the first author, year
of
publication,
country,
sample
size,
study
design,
setting, treatment protocol for SUP and comparator,
severity of illness, and all predefined outcomes. Quality
of included studies was evaluated using the risk of bias
tool recommended by the Cochrane Collaboration [25].
We assigned a value of high, unclear, or low to the
following items: sequence generation; allocation conceal-
ment;
blinding;
incomplete
outcome
data;
selective
outcome reporting; and other sources of bias. Discrepan-
cies were identified and resolved through discussion.
Outcomes and statistical analysis
The primary outcome was bleeding rate, which was
defined as overt GI bleeding (if reported in the enrolled
studies) or clinically important GI bleeding (if overt GI
bleeding was not reported in the enrolled studies).
Secondary outcomes included incidence of HAP, overall
mortality, C. difficile infection, length of ICU stay, and
duration of mechanical ventilation. When the outcome
of HAP was unavailable, the rate of VAP was used. The
results from all relevant studies were merged to estimate
the pooled risk ratio (RR) and associated 95% confidence
intervals (CIs) for dichotomous outcomes. As to the
continuous outcomes, mean difference (MD) and 95%
CI was estimated as the effect result. Some studies
reported the median as the measure of treatment effect,
with accompanying interquartile range (IQR). Before
data analysis, we estimated the mean from the median
and
standard
deviation
(SD)
from
the
IQR
using
methods described in previous studies [26].
Heterogeneity was tested with I2 statistics. I2 < 50%
was considered to indicate insignificant heterogeneity
and a fixed-effect model was used, whereas a random-
Huang et al. Critical Care  (2018) 22:20 
Page 2 of 9
 effect model was used in cases of significant heterogen-
eity (I2 > 50%). To explore the robustness and the
potential influence of factors of our primary outcome,
we performed subgroup analyses including type of SUP
drugs (sucralfate, PPIs or H2RAs), route of administra-
tion (enteral or intravenous), study design (blinded or
unblinded), sample size (<100 or >100), published year
(before year 2000 or after year 2000), and clinical setting
(medical, surgery, or mixed ICU). We also conducted
sensitivity analyses on GI bleeding by pooling studies
only focusing on: (a) overt GI bleeding; (b) clinically
important GI bleeding; (c) a randomized-effects model;
and (d) early EN (initiated within 48 hours of ICU
admission). Publication bias was deemed to be evaluated
by visually inspecting funnel plots when at least 10
studies were included in this meta-analysis. A p value
<0.05 was considered statistically significant. All statis-
tical analyses were performed using Review Manager,
Version 5.3.
Result
Study selection
A flowchart of the search strategy and the reasons for
exclusion are shown in Fig. 1. The initial search identi-
fied a total of 533 citations: 155 studies were excluded
because of duplicate studies, and 362 studies were
excluded based on reviews of the title and abstract.
Thus, 16 studies were full-text read for further evalu-
ation. Of these 16 studies, 9 were excluded because they
did not provide sufficient information on EN (Additional
file 1: S2). Finally, the remaining seven RCTs, which
enrolled 889 patients, were included in our final analysis
[18, 21–23, 27–29].
Study characteristics and quality
The main characteristics and predefined outcome data
of the included RCTs are described in Tables 1 and 2.
The variable definitions of GI bleeding and HAP are
summarized in Additional file 1: file S3. These studies
were published between 1985 and 2017, with sample
sizes ranging from 28 to 300 patients. Four out of the
seven RCTs used placebo as the comparator [18, 23, 27,
29], while the other three used no prophylaxis [21, 22,
28]. As for the type of prophylaxis drugs used, H2RAs
and PPI were used in four [18, 27–29] and three studies
[21–23], respectively, whereas H2RAs and sucralfate
were used in one study [22]. During the study period, all
patients received adequate EN (61–100%). Overt GI
bleeding was reported in six RCTs [18, 21, 23, 27, 29],
while three studies reported clinically important bleeding
[18, 22, 28]. The Cochrane risk of bias score for each
citation varied across the studies (Additional file 1: file
S4). We did not assess the publication bias because of the
limited number (<10) of studies included in each analysis.
Primary outcome
GI bleeding was reported in all seven RCTs. The pooled
analysis showed that, in enterally fed patients, SUP did
not reduce the risk of GI bleeding (7 studies; n = 889, RR
0.80; 95% CI, 0.49 to 1.31; I2 = 8%; p = 0.96) (Fig. 2). Al-
though there was no significant heterogeneity, we pro-
ceeded to perform stratified analyses across predefined
key study characteristics and clinical factors. In general,
all the subgroup analyses confirmed similar rates of GI
bleeding among groups. Sensitivity analyses were subse-
quently
conducted,
and
suggested
that
when
only
clinically important GI bleeding or overt GI bleeding or
randomized-effects models or early EN were considered,
there was no difference between groups. Details of the
results of subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses are
shown in Table 3.
Secondary outcomes
There was no statistically significant difference between the
SUP and the no SUP groups in overall mortality (6 studies,
n = 861; RR 1.21; 95% CI, 0.94 to 1.56; I2 = 0%; p = 0.14)
[18, 21, 22, 27–29] (Fig. 3a) or C. difficile infection (3 stud-
ies, n = 407; RR 0.89; 95% CI, 0.29 to 3.19; I2 = 0%; p = 0.86)
[18, 27, 29] (Fig. 3b). The length of stay in the ICU (4 stud-
ies, n = 707, MD 0.04 days; 95% CI, −0.79 to 0.87, I2 = 48%;
p = 0.92) [18, 22, 27, 29] (Fig. 3c) and duration of mechan-
ical ventilation (4 studies, n = 707, MD −0.38 days; 95% CI,
−1.48 to 0.72, I2 = 17%; p = 0.50) [18, 22, 27, 29] (Fig. 3d)
were also similar. The incidence of HAP was higher in SUP
group (5 studies, n = 407; RR 1.53; 95% CI, 1.04 to 2.27; I2

 = 0%; p = 0.03) [18, 21, 22, 27, 28] (Fig. 3e), while the inci-
dence of VAP was comparable between groups (3 studies, n
= 425; RR 1.24; 95% CI, 0.72 to 2.15; I2 = 0%; p = 0.44)
(Fig. 3f) [18, 27, 28].
Discussion
Our meta-analysis showed that, among ICU patients
receiving enteral feeding, pharmacologic SUP exerted no
impact on the risk of GI bleeding, overall mortality, C.
difficile infection, duration of MV and length of ICU
stay, but led to an increased risk of HAP.
In this updated meta-analysis, we found that there was
no added benefit with concomitant pharmacologic SUP
in GI bleeding once patients were receiving enteral
feeding. This finding expanded on the earlier meta-
analyses to provide better evidence for pharmacologic
SUP in enterally fed patients in the ICU [4]. First, our
meta-analysis had a larger sample size than the previous
meta-analyses
as
it
included
four
RCTs
published
between 2016 and 2017, with more power to assess this
effect. Second, the subgroup and sensitivity analyses
based on various clinical characteristics did not signifi-
cantly alter our main findings. Finally, we further evalu-
ated other related important outcomes (e.g., duration of
mechanical ventilation, overall mortality, and length of
stay in the ICU) and found no difference between groups,
thus providing evidence of the robustness of our results.
Apart from calorie delivery, EN had also been found
to protect against stress-related GI bleeding [4, 14–16].
EN might mitigate macroscopic ulceration by optimizing
mucosal energy, intramucosal pH [17, 30] and regional
distribution of gastrointestinal blood flow [31, 32]. In
addition, EN was able to reduce GI inflammation
secondary to reperfusion injury. To date, there had been
no RCTs comparing GI bleeding rates in critically ill
patients receiving EN versus no EN. Several case series

 involving a total of 749 patients reported that enterally
fed critically ill patients in the absence of pharmacologic
SUP was associated with bleeding rates of 8.4–8.8% [3,
33]. In our study, we also found a similar bleeding rate
(7.5%) in patients receiving EN alone. In comparison,
Marik et al. reported a GI bleeding rate of 15.8% in the
subgroup of patients without EN or any pharmacologic
SUP [4]. A similar incidence (17.5%) was also identified
in a recent meta-analysis in unfed patients [19]. These
data suggest a potential role of EN against stress-related
GI bleeding, therefore questioning any added benefits of
pharmacologic SUP in patients already receiving EN.
Our results indicated that pharmacologic SUP in
enterally fed patients is associated with higher incidence
of HAP, which is consistent with the previous meta-
analysis [4]. The reason might be that concomitant EN
and pharmacologic SUP would result in a significantly
higher pH than either intervention alone [17]. However,
we should interpret this finding cautiously. First, the
definitions of HAP varied across included studies, with
the incidence ranging from 8.4 to 52.9% [18, 21–23, 27–
29]. Second, the included studies had spanned a period
of more than three decades, when co-interventions had
been developed and quality improvement approaches
such as guidelines for HAP/VAP prevention had been
introduced and updated [34]. This, to some extent,
might affect the accurate evaluation of the effects of
SUP. In fact, the significant increase in pneumonia was

 mainly caused by the two earlier trials [21, 22], but not
the newly published RCTs [18, 27, 28]. When only the
three RCTs that focused on VAP were considered, no
differences were found between groups [18, 27, 28].
Finally, we did not find significant differences in terms
of other secondary outcomes (e.g., mortality, duration of
mechanical ventilation, or length of stay in the ICU).
Recently, more and more attention had been paid to the
possible association between the SUP strategy and
enteric infections, particularly C. difficile [13]. Several
epidemiological investigations and meta-analyses had
demonstrated an increased risk of C. difficile infection in

 patients under a SUP strategy. In addition, studies
suggested that PPIs were more strongly associated with
this enteric infection than H2RAs [12, 13]. However,
these results could not place sufficient weight on RCT
evidence. It was noteworthy that no study had investi-
gated the effect of EN on C. difficile infection. Our
results suggested that in enterally fed patients the rate of
C. difficile infection was similar in the SUP and non-
SUP groups (1.9% vs. 2.0%). The relatively small number
of events may account for these negative results. There-
fore, further well-designed, large RCTs are warranted to
focus on this topic, as the detrimental outcomes of these
serious infections may outweigh the benefit of SUP.
Recently, there has been growing interest in PPIs as a
means of SUP. For example, all four additional RCTs
included in our meta-analysis compared the effect of PPIs
with placebo. Moreover, PPIs were also increasingly pre-
scribed as the primary SUP agent, ranging from 39.6 to
70% in critically ill patients [8, 35]. In a recent international
survey, PPIs were the most comment agent (66%) used for
SUP [1]. This might be due to the superiority of PPIs in
reducing GI bleeding, as suggested by several meta-analyses
[20, 36], and the recommendations of the Surviving Sepsis
Campaign [37]. Despite the widespread use of PPIs, the
effect of concomitant EN in this SUP procedure is rarely
evaluated. In our study, only four included RCTs focused
on this topic, and pooled results suggested no benefit or
harm associated with PPIs. Though limited by the small
sample, our data may, at the very least, encourage clinicians
to reevaluate their practice in prescribing prophylactic PPIs
in critically ill patients. As a matter of fact, several ongoing
RCTs comparing PPIs with placebo in ICU patients with
high risk of GI bleeding may provide more convincing
evidence in the future [38–40].
Our study has some limitations. First, only seven studies
were included in our analysis, and most of them had a
sample size of less than 200 [18, 21, 23, 28, 29], which
would more likely result in overestimation of effect size.
Thus, further studies in large cohorts are needed to
validate our findings. Second, there were differences
among included trials with regards to the adopted
definition of GI bleeding, timing and duration of EN, and
patient intolerance of EN, which might lead to the
observed heterogeneity, and therefore compromise the
robustness of our findings. Third, the uneven distribution
of different underlying diseases among included studies
might also exert a prognostic value. We planned to
perform subgroup analyses to explore studies based on
such diversities, which was hampered by nsufficient data.
Fourth, although predefined subgroup analyses had been
performed, some results of subgroups should be inter-
preted with caution due to small number of patients.
Finally, we had not pre-published this updated meta-
analysis protocol in a registry.
Conclusion
In summary, based on available data, our results
demonstrate
that
in
ICU
patients
receiving
EN,
pharmacologic SUP offered no beneficial effect on the
incidence of GI bleeding and other clinically important
outcomes. Large-scale, well-designed RCTs will be
needed to confirm our findings.
Key messages
� In patients receiving EN in the ICU, pharmacologic
SUP showed no beneficial effect on GI bleeding,
overall mortality, Clostridium difficile infection,
length of stay in the ICU or duration of mechanical
ventilation, but was associated with an increased
incidence of HAP.
� Further larger adequately powered RCTs with
rigorous definitions and designs are warranted to
confirm our results.
