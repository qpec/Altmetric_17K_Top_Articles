BACKGROUND & AIMS: Fecal microbiota transplantation
(FMT) is recommended for treatment of recurrent Clostridium
difficile
infection
(rCDI).
We
performed
a
single-center
randomized trial to compare the effects of FMT with those of
fidaxomicin and vancomycin. METHODS: We studied consec-
utive adults with rCDI seen at a gastroenterology clinic in
Denmark from April 5, 2016 through June 10, 2018. Patients
were randomly assigned to a group that received FMT, applied
by colonoscopy or nasojejunal tube, after 4–10 days of vanco-
mycin (125 mg 4 times daily; FMTv; n ¼ 24), 10 days of
fidaxomicin (200 mg twice daily; n ¼ 24), or 10 days of van-
comycin (125 mg 4 times daily; n ¼ 16). Patients who had rCDI
after this course of treatment and patients who could not be
randomly assigned to groups were offered rescue FMTv. The
primary outcome was combined clinical resolution and a
negative result from a polymerase chain reaction test for
Clostridium difficile (CD) toxin 8 weeks after the allocated
treatment. Secondary end points included clinical resolution at
week 8. RESULTS: All 64 patients received their assigned
treatment. The combination of clinical resolution and negative
results from the test for CD were observed in 17 patients given
FMTv (71%), 8 patients given fidaxomicin (33%), and 3
patients given vancomycin (19%; P ¼ .009 for FMTv vs fidax-
omicin; P ¼ .001 for FMTv vs vancomycin; P ¼ .31 for fidax-
omicin vs vancomycin). Clinical resolution was observed in 22
patients given FMTv (92%), 10 patients given fidaxomicin
(42%), and 3 patients given vancomycin (19%; P ¼ .0002; P <
.0001; P ¼ .13). Results did not differ significantly between
patients who received FMTv as their initial therapy and pa-
tients who received rescue FMTv. There was 1 serious adverse
event that might have been related to FMTv. CONCLUSIONS: In
a randomized trial of patients with rCDI, we found the FMTv
combination superior to fidaxomicin or vancomycin based on
end points of clinical and microbiological resolution or clinical
resolution alone. ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02743234;

CLINICAL AT
 C
lostridium difficile (CD) infection (CDI) is a major
cause of nosocomial diarrhea and constitutes 20%–
30% of antibiotic-associated diarrhea.1 The occurrence of
CDI is increasing in hospital settings and in the community,
and the disease poses a serious public health challenge.2–5
Risk factors for developing CDI include advanced age, co-
morbidity, and recent antibiotic use.6 Ninety-day mortality
is up to 22%, and CDI is a contributing factor in up to 40%
of these deaths.6–8 The recurrence risk is 20% and in-
creases with age older than 65 years, severe underlying
disease, and use of antibiotics or proton pump inhibitors.9–
11 Patients who have 1 recurrent CDI (rCDI) have a 45%
risk of further recurrence.12 In patients with multiple re-
currences,
the
risk
of
further
recurrence
approaches
75%.13,14
Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is an emerging
therapeutic option for patients with rCDI.15–17 Resolution
rates of 70%–90% after FMT for rCDI have been consis-
tently reported in observational studies18–22 and ran-
domized
clinical
trials.13,14,23–25
FMT
could
induce
sustained symptom resolution and general well-being26
and could be effective in complicated or severe CDI.27,28
In the initial clinical trials, it was superior to high-
dose14 and tapered13 vancomycin and placebo.23 Its role
in a generic treatment algorithm remains to be deter-
mined,29,30 and its effect has not been compared with
recently developed, orally ingested, nonabsorbable anti-
biotics such as fidaxomicin.31 Although fidaxomycin and
vancomycin are equal as initial therapies for CDI, the
recurrence rate is lower with fidaxomicin than with
vancomycin.32–35 Its effects in rCDI have been described
in observational studies36,37 and in subgroups in clinical
trials.38
In this study, we compared the effects of FMT, fidax-
omicin, and standard-dose vancomycin for rCDI.
Methods
Study Design
This was a randomized, active-comparator, open-label
clinical trial that was carried out in a public referral gastro-
enterology center in Denmark. All patients who were referred
for rCDI from April 5, 2016 to June 10, 2018 were consecutively
screened for project participation.
Study Participants and Inclusion Criteria
Of 120 consecutive patients referred during the study
period, we randomized 64 adult patients with rCDI and docu-
mented recurrence within 8 weeks after stopping anti-CDI
treatment. Inclusion criteria were age at least 18 years, at
least 3 more liquid stools (Bristol 6–7) per day, a positive
polymerase chain reaction test result for CD toxin A, toxin B, or
binary toxin, and at least 1 prior treatment course with van-
comycin or fidaxomicin for CDI. The exclusion criteria were
pregnancy or breastfeeding, inability to speak or understand
the Danish language, any ongoing antibiotic treatment, use of
drugs with a known interaction with vancomycin or fidax-
omicin, allergy to either study drug, fulminant colitis that
contraindicated medical treatment, or the treating physician’s
evaluation that the patient could not tolerate project inclusion
(Supplementary Figure 1). All patients had fecal tests per-
formed for Salmonella, Campylobacter, Yersinia, and Shigella
species.
Active
inflammatory
bowel
disease
was
treated
concomitantly. Because randomization was performed before
initiating treatment and one of the treatment arms included
standard vancomycin, project participation implied a risk of up
to 2 further recurrences. In frail or septic patients, this was
considered unethical, and these patients were not randomized.
Study Interventions
Patients were randomized to FMT preceded by 4–10 days of
vancomycin 125 mg 4 times daily (FMTv; n ¼ 24), 10 days
of fidaxomicin (Dificlir, Astellas Pharma, Leiden, Holland)
200 mg 2 times daily (n ¼ 24), or 10 days of standard treat-
ment of vancomycin (Vancocin, Strides Arcolab, Watford, UK)
125 mg 4 times daily (n ¼ 16). All treatments were provided to
the patients free of charge. All patients were included by a
study investigator.
Patients who had rCDI after the primary allocated treat-
ment were offered rescue FMTv (Supplementary Figure 1).
Patients who could not be randomized because they ful-
filled at least 1 exclusion criterion (Supplementary Figure 1)
were offered FMTv off protocol. Clinical characteristics and
FMT outcome data for these patients were evaluated as an
observational follow-up study.
WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW
BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT
Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a major cause of
nosocomial diarrhea and occurrence is increasing both
in hospital settings and in the community, posing a
serious public health challenge.
NEW FINDINGS
The combination of vancomycin and fecal microbiota
transplantation (FMT) was superior to fidaxomicin or
vancomycin
in
patients
with
recurrent
Clostridium
difficile infection (rCDI), based on endpoints of clinical
and microbiological resolution or clinical resolution alone.
LIMITATIONS
The study included very few patients infected with
Clostridium difficile ribotype 027.
IMPACT
Patients with rCDI should be treated with the combination
of vancomycin and FMT. Adverse events should be
monitored closely.

FMT for Clostridium difficile Infection 1325
CLINICAL AT
 FMT was carried out using a frozen–thawed single-donor
solution of donor feces 50 g that was applied using colonos-
copy or a nasojejunal tube as previously described17 and as
outlined in the Supplementary Appendix. Healthy feces donors
were recruited and screened at the public blood center at
Aarhus University Hospital (Aarhus, Denmark).39 All donations
were voluntary, and donation and handling were carried out
according to the National Danish Tissue Act. Colonoscopically
delivered donor feces was applied to the patient after standard
lavage and with one third delivered into the terminal ileum, one
third in the cecum, and one third anally to the hepatic flexure.
Nasojejunal delivered feces was applied for 10 minutes with the
patient sitting and after an overnight fast. Delivery mode was
decided after a dialogue with the patient. As a first choice, we
advocated for colonoscopy because this is associated with the
highest rate of success and allowed for differential diagnostics in
patients who had not had a previous colonoscopy. In frail pa-
tients who could not tolerate bowel lavage or in patients whose
previous colonoscopy had been technically difficult because of
adhesions, we advocated for nasojejunal tube delivery.
Outcome Measures
The primary end point was combined clinical resolution
and a negative CD test result without the need for rescue FMTv
or colectomy 8 weeks after the initial treatment. Secondary end
points included clinical resolution at week 8, a negative CD test
result at week 8, combined clinical resolution and negative CD
test result at week 1, clinical resolution at week 1, and a
negative CD test result at week 1. Patients who had clinical
recurrence and had a positive CD test result before or at week 8
were offered rescue FMTv with similar follow-up. Patients who
could not be randomized were offered FMTv off protocol with
similar follow-up at 1 and 8 weeks.
For comparison with other previously published clinical
trials, a post hoc outcome measure was defined: resolution of
CD-associated diarrhea (ie, clinical resolution or persistent
diarrhea with a negative CD test result).
The CD test was performed as an in-house or, for urgent
diagnosis, as a GeneXpert (Xpert C. difficile BT, Cepheid,
Sweden) polymerase chain reaction targeting genes for toxin A
(in house only), toxin B, and binary toxin, and the deletion in
position 117 in the tcdC gene (tcdC-D-117) to detect CD ribo-
type 027. Any combination of toxins was considered a positive
test result. For a positive test result for binary toxin or tcdC-D-
117, a specimen was referred to the Danish reference labora-
tory at the Statens Serum Institut (Copenhagen, Denmark).
Adverse Events
Adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs (SAEs) might be
underreported in FMT studies.40–42 We prospectively docu-
mented AEs and SAEs, as defined by published guidelines,43–45
in all randomized patients. Immediate complications to FMT
(ie, those that occurred within 24 hours) were documented
separately.
Statistical Analyses
A sample size calculation was performed before initiating
the trial.46 To detect a minimal clinically relevant difference of
40% between FMTv and fidaxomicin in the primary outcome,
and estimating that FMTv would achieve 80% power and
fidaxomicin would achieve 40% power and using a type I error
of 0.05 and a type II error of 0.20 (80% power), we calculated
that 22 patients were needed in each treatment group. After
allowing for a dropout rate of 10%, we included 24 patients for
fidaxomicin and 24 patients for FMTv.
All data were entered prospectively in standardized case
report forms using Research Data Capture (REDCap) software
(www.redcap.au.dk). After validation by the Good Clinical
Practice Unit as described below and double entry of key var-
iables, data were exported unedited for statistical analyses.
Predefined syntax commands developed in SPSS 20 for
Windows (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY) were used for all analyses.
Continuous

reported
as

(ranges).
Outcome frequencies are reported as percentages with 95%
confidence intervals (CIs).47,48 Bivariate comparisons were
carried out using the c2 test and Kruskal-Wallis analysis of
variance. A statistical significance level of .05 was applied.
To identify patient risk factors for failure after FMT, we
conducted a forward stepwise logistic regression analysis with
set probabilities for entry (.05) and removal (.10) in the model
that included a constant. Only covariates that were statistically
significantly associated with failure with a significance level of
.01 to adjust for multiple comparisons were included in the
regression analysis.
Ethical Considerations
All patients provided written informed consent before in-
clusion. The study protocol was approved by the Central
Denmark Region Ethics Committee (j.no. 1-10-72-2577-15) and
by the Danish Medicines Agency (j.no. 2015092214). Data
storage was approved by the Danish Data Protection Agency
(j.no. 1-16-02-15-16). The study was conducted according
to the principles for Good Clinical Practice and was monitored
by the Good Clinical Practice Unit at the Aarhus and Aalborg
University Hospitals (j. no. 2015/589). Before initiation,
the trial protocol was registered in publicly accessible data-
bases
(ClinicalTrials.gov,
identifier
NCT02743234,
www.
clinicaltrials.gov; EudraCT, j. no. 2015-003004-24, www.
clinicaltrialsregister.eu). All authors had access to the study
data and reviewed and approved the final report.
Results
Study Participants and Primary Treatment
From April 5, 2016 to June 10, 2018, 120 consecutively
referred
patients
were
screened
for
participation
(Supplementary Figure 1). We randomized 64 adult patients
with documented rCDI. Randomized patients had a median
age of 68 years, low comorbidity with a median Charlson
comorbidity score of 1, and a median of 4 previous CDI
episodes (Table 1). Fifteen (23%) had inflammatory bowel
disease. No randomized patients had CD ribotype 027.
All 64 randomized patients received the allocated
treatment. In patients randomized to FMTv (n ¼ 24), 19
(79%) received the fecal transplant through colonoscopy
and 5 (21%) received the transplant through a nasojejunal
tube in accord with doctor–patient agreement. Six different
healthy donors delivered feces for the study. The study was
terminated after inclusion of all patients and according to
the protocol.
Of the 120 patients screened for inclusion, 56 could not
be
randomized
(Supplementary
Figure
1).

 common reason for exclusion from the trial was the physi-
cian’s evaluation that the patients could not tolerate inclu-
sion (n ¼ 19). Most of these patients had sepsis, fulminant
colitis, or general deterioration. Patients who could not
consent to participation (n ¼ 12) had progressive dementia
or somnolence. Patients who could not be randomized had a
statistically significantly higher comorbidity score, poorer
performance, lower plasma albumin and hemoglobin levels,
and
higher
C-reactive
protein
level
than
randomized
patients (Table 2). Although 6 (11%, 95% CI 4–22) of the
64 randomized patients were hospitalized at inclusion,
31 (55%, 95% CI 41–69) of the 56 patients with failed
screening were hospitalized (P < .0001).
Primary Outcome
Combined clinical resolution and negative CD test result
were achieved in 17 (71%, 95% CI 49–87) of 24 patients
with FMTv, 8 (33%, 95% CI 16–55) of 24 patients with
fidaxomicin, and 3 (19%, 95% CI 5–46) of 16 patients with
vancomycin (P ¼ .009 for FMTv vs fidaxomicin; P ¼ .001 for
FMTv vs vancomycin; P ¼ .31 for fidaxomicin vs vancomy-
cin; Figure 1).
Secondary Outcomes
Clinical resolution was obtained in 22 (92%, 95% CI
73–99) of 24 patients treated with FMTv, 10 (42%, 95%
CI 22–63) of 24 treated with fidaxomicin, and 3 (19%,
95% CI 4–46) of 16 treated with vancomycin (Figure 1). All
outcome data are presented in Table 3.
Although 7 patients who were randomized to FMTv did
not attain the combined primary outcome, 5 (71%, 95% CI
29–96) of these had clinical resolution and did not require
or request rescue FMT. The corresponding figures in
patients randomized to fidaxomicin and vancomycin mon-
otherapies were 2 of 16 (13%, 95% CI 4–36) and 0 of 13
(0%, 95% CI 0–23), respectively (P < .001). We observed no
differences in effect relative to method (colonoscopy vs
nasojejunal tube) or donor (data not shown).

FMT for Clostridium difficile Infection 1327
CLINICAL AT
 Rescue FMT for Patients With Recurrence After
Allocated Treatment
Of the 64 randomized patients, 24 had clinical relapse
and a positive CD test result before or at 8 weeks after the
allocated treatment. All these patients had rescue FMTv
performed, delivered by colonoscopy (n ¼ 18) or nasoje-
junal tube (n ¼ 6). Overall, 20 (83%, 95% CI 63–95) of the
24 patients who received rescue FMTv had clinical resolu-
tion and a negative CD test result at 8 weeks after rescue
FMTv: 1 of 2 patients (50%, 95% CI 1–99) initially allocated
to FMTv, 9 of 11 patients (82%, 95% CI 48–97) initially
allocated to fidaxomicin, and 10 of 11 patients (91%, 95%
CI 59–100) initially allocated to vancomycin. The treatment
responses were similar across primary treatment arms (P ¼
.36) and similar to the effects in patients initially random-
ized to FMTv (P ¼ .20).
FMT Performed in Patients Who Could Not Be
Randomized
Of the 56 patients with failed screening, off-protocol
FMTv was performed in 49 (88%) and consisted of 1–3
FMT treatments preceded by vancomycin. At week 8 after
FMTv, 39 (80%, 95% CI 66–90) had clinical resolution and a
negative CD test result, which was similar to the rates in the
patients who were randomized to primary FMTv and the
patients who received rescue FMTv after failure of the primary
allocatedantibiotictreatment in therandomizedtrial(P¼ .43).
Risk Factors for FMT Failure
Of 95 patients who had FMT as primary or rescue
treatment or after screen failure, 11 (12%) had rCDI at or
before week 8. In a logistic regression analysis, we analyzed
risk factors for failure (Supplementary Table 1). In bivariate
analyses, only the Charlson comorbidity index score and
baseline hemoglobin level were statistically significantly
associated with FMT failure (odds ratios 1.5 [95% CI 1.1–
1.9] and 0.5 [95% CI 1.1–3.8], respectively). In the final
regression model, hemoglobin was the strongest and
only statistically significant covariate associated with fail-
ure of FMT, with an odds ratio of 0.5 (95% CI 0.3–0.99)
per point increase in hemoglobin. Mean hemoglobin in
patients with FMT failure was 6.7 mmol/L (95% CI 5.7–
7.7) in women and 6.0 mmol/L (95% CI 4.8–7.2) in men
compared with 7.3 mmol/L (95% CI 7.0–7.7) in women
and 7.9 mmol/L (95% CI 7.4–8.4) in men who had reso-
lution (P ¼ .003). The presence of anemia (ie, hemoglobin
level below the sex-specific reference interval) was asso-
ciated with a 6.3 times increased risk of failure of (95% CI
1.3–30.9).

 Adverse Events
Immediate complications of FMTv included any AE that
occurred up to 24 hours after the procedure. Of the 24
patients allocated to FMTv, 14 (58%, 95% CI 37–78) had no
side effects. Ten patients (42%, 95% CI 22–63%) experi-
enced transient abdominal pain (n ¼ 1), bloating (n ¼ 5),
constipation (n ¼ 1), or diarrhea (n ¼ 3). One SAE could
be related to FMTv: a 50-year-old woman developed a
sepsis-like clinical picture with pyrexia, convulsions, vom-
iting, and diarrhea in her private home for 3 hours the eve-
ning after an uncomplicated FMT delivered by colonoscopy.
Although perceived life-threatening, the patient was not
admitted to the hospital and had complete recovery within
24 hours without further treatment. Of 22 patients with
rescue FMT, AEs were observed in 4: headache and dizziness
(n ¼ 1), bloating (n ¼ 1), pain and vomiting (n ¼ 1), and pain
and nausea (n ¼ 1). Three of these patients had FMT per-
formed by colonoscopy and 1 by nasojejunal tube.
During 8-week follow-up, 29 (45%) of all patients
experienced
a
total
of
48
AEs,
not
including
rCDI
(Supplementary Table 2). We observed no differences
among the 3 treatment groups for the frequency of AEs or
SAEs as a whole or when sub-grouped into gastrointestinal-
related symptoms, non-gastrointestinal infections, or other
AEs, with the important exception of CDI recurrence. One
patient had small bowel bacterial overgrowth after primary
FMTv. The FMTv had been delivered colonoscopically, and
the condition resolved after 6 days of treatment with
rifaximin 400 mg twice daily.
No deaths occurred. No AEs could be related specifically
to a specific antibiotic treatment. We observed no statisti-
cally significant changes in body weight, plasma albumin, or
hemoglobin in the randomized patients during the 8-week
follow-up (data not shown).
Discussion
This is the first clinical trial to compare the effects of
FMT for rCDI with those of fidaxomicin. We found that FMT
delivered by colonoscopy or nasojejunal tube after a short
course of vancomycin was superior to fidaxomicin and
standard-dose vancomycin monotherapies. Rescue FMT
delivered to patients with recurrence after their primary
allocated treatment and FMT delivered to patients who
could not be randomized yielded similar clinical results.
An overall clinical effect of FMTv of 92% is in accordance
with findings in previous clinical trials.14,49 Most previous
studies defined resolution as clinical resolution or absence
of CD-associated diarrhea. The use of either definition did
not change our outcome rates or relative differences
between treatments.
The finding that fidaxomicin was inferior to FMTv for
rCDI is of clinical importance. Fidaxomycin and vancomycin
are equivalent for the initial therapy of CDI, but the recur-
rence
rate
is
lower
with
fidaxomicin
than
with
vancomycin.32–35 In the present study, the resolution rates
for fidaxomicin and vancomycin were not statistically
significantly different, but this study was not powered to

 demonstrate a difference between the 2 antibiotics, and no
inference in this regard should be made from the present
study. The choice of treatment should be balanced according
to risks and benefits.
Because antibiotic treatment at time of assessment
was an exclusion criterion, patients who were considered
too frail or for other reasons unable to wait to start
treatment were not randomized in the present study.
Patients whose screening failed had higher comorbidity
and hospitalization rates than patients who were ran-
domized. The finding of comparable resolution rates in
randomized patients who were randomized to primary
FMTv, patients who had rescue FMTv after failure of the
primary antibiotics treatment, and patients who received
FMTv after screen failure gives the present study high
generalizability.
A low baseline hemoglobin level was a strong predictor
of failure of FMTv in the present study. This new finding
could prove clinically relevant and could be useful for a
priori identification of patients who would benefit from
multiple FMT procedures.50 The presence of anemia could
reflect the overall burden of disease and longstanding
inflammation and better reflect frailty than variables such as
patient age and comorbidity.51 This finding needs to be
validated in other patient cohorts.
It might be clinically important that 5 of 7 patients who
had positive CD test results at 8 weeks after primary FMTv
experienced clinical resolution and did not require rescue
FMT. Other studies have reported only the results of CD toxin
tests in patients with persistent diarrhea, and this practice is
in accordance with recent guidelines.52 The impact of a
positive CD test result despite clinical resolution is unclear.
Our use of a toxin test instead of fecal cultures might have
overestimated the occurrence of clinically relevant carrier
status. Future studies should examine whether toxin carrier
status is a risk factor for future CDI recurrence or for
dissemination of CD spores causing nosocomial infections.
Important limitations include the absence of patients
infected with CD ribotype 027. Therefore, our results might
not be generalizable to patients with a high frequency of
ribotype 027. Study interventions were unblinded, and
observer bias might have affected reporting. To obtain an
objective outcome measure, we applied the CD toxin test to
all patients at all time points.
In conclusion, FMTv was superior to fidaxomicin and
vancomycin monotherapies for rCDI for combined clinical
and microbiological resolution and clinical resolution alone.
Resolution rates similar to those in patients randomized to
FMT were found in patients who had been randomized to
antibiotic treatment and were offered rescue FMT after CDI
recurrence and in patients who could not be randomized
and were offered FMT off protocol.

 Supplementary Appendix: Clinical
Framework for the Delivery of FMT in
Compliance With the National Danish
Tissue Act
Regulatory Framework
The study was conducted in an established clinical FMT
service established in a public university hospital and
compliant with the Danish Tissue Act. The National Tissue
Act is derived from the European Tissue and Cell Directive.
Currently in Denmark, no public authorities regulate in-
stitutions that perform FMT, although the National Board of
Health strongly recommends that FMT institutions follow
the handling, safety, and documentation principles that are
provisioned in the Danish Tissue Act.
The established FMT service is separated into 3 main
activities: (1) donor selection and screening, (2) laboratory
processing, and (3) clinical application.
Donor Selection and Screening
Voluntary feces donors were identified and recruited at
the public blood center. The donors were approached in
person during the time of donating blood or plasma. Sub-
sequently, all donors fulfilled all criteria to donate blood.
Feces donors were recruited consecutively. Donors who
consented were enrolled in a stepwise screening program.
The content of the screening program was adopted ac-
cording to previously published protocols and consensus
reports. Donors completed an electronic questionnaire that
addressed gastrointestinal complaints, risk behavior, and
diet and ruled out risk factors. Donors who were found
eligible progressed to screening of blood and feces. Blood
samples were obtained on site, and the donor received a
fecal collection kit to collect a fecal sample from the next
defecation at home. The fecal samples were received and
tested at the department of clinical microbiology. When all
screening results were present, the donors were contacted
by
phone,
and
eligible
donors
were
booked
for
a
consultation with a gastroenterologist to formally become
active feces donors. All active feces donors donated in
rounds of 5 donations within a 2-month period. At the
beginning and ending of each round, the donors were
retested on all screening parameters for release of the
donor material. At each donation, the donor declared in
writing to be in good health, that no health changes had
occurred, and that the donor had delivered the donor
feces.
Laboratory Processing
Donations were delivered from the feces donors’ home
and brought to the laboratory within 2 hours. The donation
was collected in a food-approved plastic bag and placed in
an airtight container. The container was placed in a cooler
bag, validated for transportation of biological substances. At
the FMT laboratory, the feces donation was processed to
produce and preserve consistent fecal suspensions appli-
cable for clinical application. The processing procedures
were performed in a sterilized fume cupboard to avoid
contamination. The feces donation was diluted with normal
0.9% NaCl and blended using a donor-dedicated household
blender. Then, the suspension was passed through a filter to
remove debris. A 10% glycerol titer was added to improve
bacterial viability when aliquoted into CryoBags and stored
at �80�C. Each CryoBag contained a minimum of 50 g of
donor feces. All CryoBags were kept in quarantine until the
donor had completed an entire donation round and all
screening results
were
present
and
approved.
When
requested, released CryoBags were thawed for 45 minutes
before administration. The fecal suspension had to be
administered within 4 hours. We kept 2 safety samples
from each CryoBag that could be tested in case of SAEs
related to FMT.
Clinical Application
The clinical application procedures are described in
detail in the main text.
