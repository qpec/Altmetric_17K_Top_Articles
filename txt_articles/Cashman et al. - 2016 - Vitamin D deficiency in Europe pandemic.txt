ABSTRACT
Background: Vitamin D deficiency has been described as being
pandemic, but serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] distribution
data for the European Union are of very variable quality. The NIH-
led international Vitamin D Standardization Program (VDSP) has
developed protocols for standardizing existing 25(OH)D values
from national health/nutrition surveys.
Objective: This study applied VDSP protocols to serum 25(OH)D
data from representative childhood/teenage and adult/older adult
European populations, representing a sizable geographical footprint,
to better quantify the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in Europe.
Design: The VDSP protocols were applied in 14 population studies
[reanalysis of subsets of serum 25(OH)D in 11 studies and complete
analysis of all samples from 3 studies that had not previously mea-
sured it] by using certified liquid chromatography–tandem mass
spectrometry on biobanked sera. These data were combined with
standardized serum 25(OH)D data from 4 previously standardized
studies (for a total n = 55,844). Prevalence estimates of vitamin D
deficiency [using various serum 25(OH)D thresholds] were gener-
ated on the basis of standardized 25(OH)D data.
Results: An overall pooled estimate, irrespective of age group,
ethnic mix, and latitude of study populations, showed that 13.0%
of the 55,844 European individuals had serum 25(OH)D concentra-
tions ,30 nmol/L on average in the year, with 17.7% and 8.3% in
those sampled during the extended winter (October–March) and
summer (April–November) periods, respectively. According to an
alternate suggested definition of vitamin D deficiency (,50 nmol/
L), the prevalence was 40.4%. Dark-skinned ethnic subgroups had
much higher (3- to 71-fold) prevalence of serum 25(OH)D ,30 nmol/L
than did white populations.
Conclusions: Vitamin D deficiency is evident throughout the Euro-
pean population at prevalence rates that are concerning and that
require action from a public health perspective. What direction
these strategies take will depend on European policy but should
aim to ensure vitamin D intakes that are protective against vitamin
D deficiency in the majority of the European population.

 INTRODUCTION
Vitamin D is the nutrient that has captured the attention of the
scientific and medical communities, regulatory agencies, the food
industry, and the public alike over the past 15 y. This is evidenced
by the explosion of scientific literature, a dramatic increase in
physician-requested tests for patient vitamin D status in some
countries, a number of authoritative re-evaluations of dietary
recommendations, and sales of vitamin D supplements and the
increased number of vitamin D–fortified food products coming
on the market. Vitamin D deficiency has been described as being
pandemic (1), with associated direct and indirect costs for Europe
estimated to be running at hundreds of billion Euro (2).
Vitamin D deficiency has been variably defined as possessing
a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D,26 the biochemical
index of vitamin D status (3)] concentration ,25 to ,75 nmol/L
(4). Knowledge of the distributions of serum 25(OH)D con-
centrations in representative populations, with appropriate con-
sideration of sex, life stage, ethnicity, and seasonality, is critical
for the quantification of vitamin D deficiency as well as for
devising effective strategies for its prevention (4, 5). However,
serum 25(OH)D distribution data for the European Union are
of variable quality, making it difficult to estimate the prevalence
of vitamin D deficiency across member states. For example,
a recent systematic review of vitamin D status in populations
worldwide clearly showed that the variability in mean serum
25(OH)D concentrations across European countries was large,
and even within a country, the variability from different studies
ranged from 10% to 300% (6). Although there are many likely
contributory reasons for differences in vitamin D deficiency
prevalence estimates between populations, differences in ana-
lytic method for serum 25(OH)D are likely to contribute (4). In
addition, several reports have shown that available 25(OH)D
assays can yield markedly differing results (7–10).
Calls have been made to use centralized laboratories to make
an international comparison of serum 25(OH)D and vitamin D
deficiency prevalence estimates more reliable (11), but this ap-
proach might not be feasible, given existing national structures
and systems. As a consequence of these widespread, method-
related differences in results of serum 25(OH)D (7–10), the NIH-
led international Vitamin D Standardization Program (VDSP)
developed protocols for standardizing 25(OH)D measurement in
national health/nutrition surveys around the world, as have been
described in detail elsewhere (4, 12). Their recent application to
serum 25(OH)D data from the Irish National Adult Nutrition
Survey showed that the yearly prevalence of serum 25(OH)D
,30 nmol/L [the US Institute of Medicine’s definition of vita-
min D deficiency (13)] increased from 6.5% (via the original
immunoassay measurement) to a projected 11.4% (14). Impor-
tantly, reanalysis of all serums in the survey (n = 1118) by our
certified liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry
(LC-MS/MS) method confirmed the true prevalence estimate as
11.2%, which was almost twice as high as the immunoassay-
based estimate and almost identical to the VDSP projection (14).
Thus, the VDSP approach, if coupled with key representative
population studies, provides the potential for generation of
prevalence estimates of vitamin D deficiency in Europe by using
standardized serum 25(OH)D data. This would permit quantifi-
cation of the magnitude of the public health problem and a solid
platform on which to build public health policy aimed at pre-
venting vitamin D deficiency in Europe. Accordingly, our ob-
jective was to apply the VDSP protocols to existing serum
25(OH)D data from 18 key (identified nationally or regionally)
representative studies of European children, teenagers, adults,
and older adults (n = 55,844 individuals).
METHODS
Studies included and categorizations applied
Within the VDSP, nationally representative nutrition and health
surveys are prioritized; however, some member states in Europe do
not have such surveys with nationally representative data on serum
25(OH)D concentrations. Thus, in the absence of such data, well-
curated samples from regionally representative health surveys can
also achieve some degree of population coverage. Our present
work is part of the European Commission–funded integrated
project, Food-based solutions for optimal vitamin D nutrition and
health through the life cycle (ODIN; www.odin-vitd.eu). One of
the primary aims of ODIN was to quantify the prevalence of
vitamin D deficiency in European populations by using stan-
dardized serum 25(OH)D values as a key prioritized existing
knowledge gap. The project included a number of identifiable
nationally representative nutrition and health surveys in addition
to regionally representative health surveys from various European
member states and of different life stage groups, which were of
strategic importance for European coverage (a brief description of
each of the studies, including their full names, acronyms, and
country of origin, is provided in the Supplemental Material).
The 14 European childhood and teenage as well as adult and
older adult study populations, identified as a priority to obtain
data on standardized serum 25(OH)D data, are as follows:
1. Healthy Lifestyle in Europe by Nutrition in Adolescence
study (9 European countries) (15, 16)
2. Optimal well-being, development and health for Danish
children through a healthy New Nordic Diet School Meal

13. Age, Gene/Environment Susceptibility–Reykjavik study

14. Finnish Migrant Health and Wellbeing Study (Maamu)
(Finland) (35, 36)
The key summary demographic characteristics (age, sex dis-
tribution, ethnicity, and season of blood sampling) of these 14
studies are shown in Table 1. We also had vitamin D deficiency
prevalence data from 4 additional European studies, on which
we had previously standardized serum 25(OH)D data by using
the same VDSP approach (14, 37), and we combined these data
with data from the 14 new studies in generating a pooled esti-
mate in the present work. The descriptions of these other 4
studies [National Adult Nutrition Survey, Ireland; Health 2011,
Finland; HUBRO (Oslo Health Study), Oslo, Norway; and
Health2006, Copenhagen, Denmark] have been reported in de-
tail elsewhere (14, 37). None of the 18 studies included pregnant
women or older adults in care homes.
Winter and spring represent the seasons during which vitamin
D status declines and reaches its nadir, typically in late winter/
early spring (38). Thus, the present work applied a wider defi-
nition capturing an extended winter (i.e., November–March) and
an extended summer period (i.e., April–October), where ap-
propriate. In the present work, we classified population samples
as being of young children if the participants were aged 1–6 y,
older children as 7–14 y, and teenagers as 15–18 y, in line with
that applied by the European Food Safety Agency in their Di-
etary Reference Values (39). Adult populations were those with
participants aged $19 y.
Categories of ethnicity varied across the population samples,
and thus in the present work, a “white” and “nonwhite” cate-
gorization was applied. The nonwhite category included those
recorded as being black, Asian, or other, including mixed race.
The exception to this categorization was within the ethnic
Maamu sample, where the study, by design, included 3 Finnish
ethnic immigrant groups: white Russian speaking, Kurdish, and
Somali (36). Details of the method used for the original serum/
plasma total 25(OH)D analysis are also shown in Table 1.
Applying the VDSP protocol for standardization of serum
25(OH)D data from past surveys to the study populations
The VDSP protocol for standardization of serum 25(OH)D
data from past surveys, as used by some of us previously on
the Irish national serum 25(OH)D data (n = 1118) (14) and that
of Finnish white adults (n = 4102) (37), as well as regionally
representative adult samples in Copenhagen, Denmark (n =
3409), and Oslo, Norway (n = 1042) (37), and again in this
study, are outlined in detail elsewhere (4, 12) but can be briefly
summarized as follows: the protocols conduct a within-quartile
uniform sampling procedure of the serum 25(OH)D data from
the entire survey sample (40) to select a subset of 100–175 bi-
obanked serum samples for reanalysis of 25(OH)D by a stan-
dardized and certified LC-MS/MS method, which is traceable to
the National Institute of Standards and Technology higher-order
Reference Measurement Procedure (4, 12). The results are used
to develop master regression equations, which then recalibrate
the existing 25(OH)D data set for the entire survey sample.
The LC-MS/MS method at University College Cork used in
this study for all samples, except those from the United King-
dom’s NDNS, is certified by the CDC’s Vitamin D Standardi-
zation Certification Program (41). Because the LC-MS/MS
method at the NDNS laboratory at the Medical Research
Council Human Nutrition Research Unit, Cambridge, was also
standardized against the National Institute of Standards and
Technology higher-order Reference Measurement Procedure
through the VDSP, this was used for their sample reanalysis to
use the biobanked samples as efficiently as possible [R2 = 0.997;
University College Cork measured (25[OH]D) = 0.968 3 Hu-
man Nutrition Research Unit measured (25[OH]D) + 0.806; n =
50 (VDSP Seattle sera [4])].
In addition to the 11 studies for which the existing serum
25(OH)D data were standardized, the biobanked sera from 3
study populations (Infant’s Nourishment and Nutritional Status,
BASELINE, and New Hoorn Study) were analyzed de novo by
the certified LC-MS/MS method and thus did not require a cal-
ibration equation. The standardized data from 14 studies in-
cluded in the present work (n = 46,173) plus the 4 studies
previously standardized by us with the VDSP approach (n =
9671) (14, 37) were used in estimating prevalence. In both hu-
man serum and plasma, 25(OH)D metabolites have been shown
to be stable when stored frozen (42) and when subjected to
multiple freeze-thaw cycles (43). In addition, Hollis (44) has
reported that long-term (.10-y) storage of pooled human
25(OH)D internal controls at 2208C led to no detectable deg-
radation of 25(OH)D.
Serum 25(OH)D thresholds
Original and standardized serum 25(OH)D concentrations were
compared with cutoffs for 25(OH)D as per the US Institute of
Medicine Dietary Reference Intake committee’s definitions:
persons are at risk of deficiency at serum 25(OH)D concentra-
tions ,30 nmol/L, whereas 40 and 50 nmol/L are consistent with
that needed by 50% and 97.5% of individuals aged .1 y, re-
spectively, in terms of bone health (13). In addition, a serum
25(OH)D concentration ,25 nmol/L has also been a traditional
cutoff used in Europe to define vitamin D deficiency on the basis
of metabolic bone disease (45, 46) and thus was also included.
Because the Task Force for the Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee
of The Endocrine Society has suggested that to maximize the
effect of vitamin D on calcium, bone, and muscle metabolism,
serum 25(OH)D concentration should exceed 75 nmol/L (47), we
also used this cutoff for comparison purposes. The same task
force suggests ,50 nmol/L as vitamin D deficiency (47).
Data and statistical analysis
Data and statistical analysis was conducted by using STATA 12
(StataCorp LP) and CBStat5 (Kristian Linnet). A statistical al-
gorithm, developed within the VDSP and published recently (40),
for estimating the number of stored samples that need to be
reanalyzed was used. The maximum projected sample size of
stored serum samples required for the VDSP protocol and with
this collection of population studies was calculated by using
procedures for the estimation of the predicted LC-MS/MS–based

 25(OH)D value for a given serum 25(OH)D value from the
original method of analysis (e.g., immunoassay or LC-MS/MS)
with a predefined precision of a 95% CI, as has been described
elsewhere (14, 37). At the beginning of the work, once pre-
liminary data on the current collection of population samples
were available [e.g., CVof assays and spread within distribution
of original serum 25(OH)D data], a projected maximum sample
size of 175 sera was estimated as being sufficient to meet and,
indeed, exceed the needs of the study with the highest number of
sera required for standardization. Thus, for logistical consider-
ations in dealing with multiple partner laboratories and groups
within the project, all groups were requested to supply 175
stored serum samples. However, this projected maximum was
confirmed as being more than sufficient for each individual
study on receipt of their full existing serum 25(OH)D data files
(post hoc analysis showed that sample size ranged from 60 to
155 sera being required). Regression models [ordinary least
squares and Deming (weighted and unweighted) and piecewise]
were used to establish the relation between the originally mea-
sured and the LC-MS/MS reanalyzed serum 25(OH)D in the
subsets, as described elsewhere (14, 37). Piecewise regression is
a method in regression analysis in which the independent vari-
able is partitioned into intervals and a separate line segment is
fit to each interval. A Deming regression model is an errors-
in-variables model that tries to find the line of best fit for a 2-
dimensional data set. It differs from the simple linear regression,
such as the ordinary least squares models, in that it accounts for
errors in observations on the x and y axes. We report prevalence
as a yearly mean (i.e., arising from blood sampling of partici-
pants that has occurred throughout the year), as well as by ex-
tended winter and summer season, as appropriate.
RESULTS
The relation between serum 25(OH)D in the statistical algo-
rithm-defined subsets of serum samples from the 11 study
populations, as measured by their original methods and rean-
alyzed by a certified LC-MS/MS method, is shown in Table 2 and
Supplemental Figures 1 and 2. Seven study populations (which
included the NDNS “old” and “new” assay formulation subsets
separately; see Supplemental Material) required a piecewise
regression fit between the previously measured and LC-MS/MS
remeasured serum 25(OH)D concentrations. A further 6 study
populations (which included the Tromsø 6 smoker and non-
smoker subsets separately) required a Deming (unweighted or
weighted) regression fit between the previously measured and
LC-MS/MS remeasured serum 25(OH)D concentrations. These
calibration equations were applied to the entire 25(OH)D data
set for the respective studies producing the standardized serum
25(OH)D data sets.
That 13.0% of the 55,844 young and adult European in-
dividuals had a yearly mean standardized serum 25(OH)D ,30
nmol/L [the US Institute of Medicine’s definition of vitamin D
deficiency (13)] was highlighted by the present overall pooled

 estimate of 18 studies [i.e., 14 standardized in the present work
plus the 4 previously standardized (14, 37)], irrespective of age
group, ethnic mix, and latitude of study populations. Among
those tested in the extended winter and summer periods, it was
17.7% and 8.2%, respectively. Using the alternately suggested
definition of vitamin D deficiency of ,50 nmol/L, as per the US
Endocrine Society (47), the yearly prevalence was 40.4%.
The mean, SD, median, and 5th, 25th, 75th, and 95th per-
centiles of serum 25(OH)D concentration using standardized
serum 25(OH)D data in the childhood and teenage as well as
adult and older adult study samples separately are shown in Table
3. The equivalent data [but based on originally analyzed serum
25(OH)D data for the 11 studies standardized in the present
work] are also shown in Table 3. The prevalence estimates for
serum 25(OH)D concentration below the variously proposed
public health–relevant thresholds, using standardized and un-
standardized serum 25(OH)D data in the childhood and teenage
as well as adult and older adult study samples separately, are
shown in Table 4. These findings highlight population sub-
groups within Europe at higher risk of vitamin D deficiency.
Within the Finnish Maamu sample, the prevalence of serum
25(OH)D ,30 nmol/L was 4.5%, 28.0%, and 50.4% for white
Russian-speaking, Somali, and Kurdish immigrant subgroups
(n = 446, 364, and 50), respectively. Likewise, although with
more limited numbers, the prevalence among the w12% non-
white participants in the United Kingdom’s NDNS (subset aged
1–18 y) was much higher (42.9%; n = 63) compared with that in
the equivalently aged white young individuals (15.0%, n = 448).
Because the nonwhite proportion of the populations in all other
studies was ,7%, the prevalence estimates by ethnicity were not
reported, but in all cases, estimates for nonwhite adult and older
adults were higher compared with that of the equivalently aged
white individuals within a study population (data not shown).
In general, sex differences in prevalence of serum 25(OH)D
,30 nmol/L within the entire collection of studies were not
evident (13.1% compared with 12.9%, on average, for males and
females, respectively). The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency
by age group, and irrespective of latitude of study populations,
suggests that teenagers may have higher risk on average. The
range of deficiency in the various teenage study populations (age
range: 15–18 y) was 12–40%, whereas childhood samples (age
ranges: 1–6 and 7–14 y), older adult samples (.61 y), and adult
samples were 4–7%, 1–8%, and 9–24%, respectively (Table 4).
Such comparisons need to be interpreted cautiously, because dif-
ferences in latitude of sample population, ethnic mix, and season
of blood sampling differed for these populations (see Table 1).
The importance of using standardized serum 25(OH)D values
for comparisons of the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency is
clearly illustrated by the data from 2 of the nationally represen-
tative surveys, both of which reside in a latitude band of 47–558N.
In the case of the German adult survey (German Health Interview
and Examination Survey for Adults; 18–79 y), the prestandard-
ization prevalence estimate [serum 25(OH)D ,30 nmol/L] of
25.9% decreased after standardization to 15.2%. For the Irish
survey (National Adult Nutrition Survey), the prevalence of
deficiency in adults (aged 18–84 y) increased from 6.6%
(prestandardization) to 12.3% after standardization. Thus, the
prevalence of vitamin D deficiency for these relatively cognate,
predominantly white adult population samples, which were
originally extremely disparate (25.9% compared with 6.6%),
became close after standardization (15.2% compared with
12.3%) (Table 4). The prevalence estimates for standardized
serum 25(OH)D concentrations ,30 and ,50 nmol/L in the 4
nationally representative survey by extended winter and sum-
mer are also shown in Table 5.
DISCUSSION
In the absence of global consensus on the concentration of
25(OH)D that defines vitamin D deficiency, the ODIN project
consortium chose to use that assigned by the US Institute of
Medicine [i.e., ,30 nmol/L (13)], which is based on risk of
metabolic bone disease. A serum 25(OH)D ,25 nmol/L has
been a traditional cutoff used in Europe for several decades (45,
46). There is universal agreement that we do not wish to have
individuals in the populations with circulating concentrations
,25–30 nmol/L. On this basis, the present work, which is the
first to report to our knowledge the prevalence estimates of vi-
tamin D deficiency based on standardized serum 25(OH)D data,
suggests that vitamin D deficiency is widespread across Europe
and at prevalence rates that meet the criteria of a pandemic
(definition of a pandemic: “an epidemic occurring worldwide, or
over a very wide area, crossing international boundaries and
usually affecting a large number of people” (48). Although there
was considerable variation dependent on age group, ethnic mix,
and latitude of study populations, overall 13% of our combined
sample of childhood, teenage, adult, and older adult population
studies across Europe (n = 55,844), ranging from southern to
mid to northern European member states (35–698N), had vita-
min D deficiency (i.e., ,30 nmol/L) at the time of sampling.
That 13 in 100 European citizens have serum 25(OH)D con-
centrations ,30 nmol/L, using even this relatively conservative
definition of vitamin D deficiency, translates into enormous
numbers of individuals and highlights the need to devise strat-
egies for prevention of vitamin D deficiency in Europe. For
example, taking the vitamin D deficiency estimates of 12.5–
15.2%, 12.3%, and 22.0% from the nationally representative
nutrition/health surveys for Germany, Ireland, and the United
Kingdom included in the present work would relate to 10.9, 0.6,
and 14.1 million individuals, respectively, in these member
states alone based on their recent census data. It is also worth
noting that other expert bodies have suggested vitamin D de-
ficiency is defined by a higher serum 25(OH)D threshold of 50
nmol/L (47). Using serum 25(OH)D ,50 nmol/L in the same
surveys would translate to 44.9, 2.1, and 32.6 million individuals
in Germany, Ireland, and the United Kingdom, respectively,
having deficiency as defined by this threshold.
The importance of using standardized serum 25(OH)D data in
the present assessment of the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency
in Europe was exemplified in the upward and downward revision
of prevalence estimates after standardization in some studies. For
example, 10.4 million fewer German adults and 267,000 more
Irish adults had vitamin D deficiency by using the estimates
based on standardized compared with the corresponding non-
standardized serum 25(OH)D data from these surveys. It should
be stressed that standardization had very little impact on serum
25(OH)D data from a minority of population samples included in
this work, which relates to the types of 25(OH)D assays used in
these studies as these perform comparably to LC-MS/MS from
an analytic perspective.

VITAMIN D DEFICIENCY IN EUROPEAN POPULATIONS
1041
Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article-abstract/103/4/1033/4662891 by guest on 03 June 2019
 As expected, there was considerable variation in prevalence of
vitamin D deficiency among the European Union countries,
which appeared to be dependent on age group. In studies of adult
and older adult populations, the prevalence of vitamin D de-
ficiency was much less in the more northerly latitude countries
such as Norway, Iceland, and Finland, whereas more mid-latitude
countries such as the United Kingdom, Ireland, Netherlands, and
Germany had a higher prevalence, even accounting for ethnicity.
The amplitude of an increase in prevalence in vitamin D de-
ficiency in extended winter compared with extended summer was
also much lower in the northerly latitude countries, which is
likely attributable to higher rates of vitamin D supplement and/or
food fortification use in these countries (49–51). In the case of
the childhood population studies, the relatively mid-latitude
countries (47–608N) had a higher prevalence range (5–20%)
than did southern countries (,418N) at 4.2–6.9%.
The present findings may also be of importance to risk
managers in the European Commission and the various member
states within Europe as they highlight population subgroups
within Europe that may be at increased risk of vitamin D de-
ficiency and that may require a specific focus on devising public
health strategies for the prevention of deficiency. Nonwhite
populations in Europe are at higher risk of vitamin D deficiency
than their white counterparts. For example, compared with white
populations in the United Kingdom, Norway, and Finland, the
nonwhite population subgroups have 3- to 71-fold higher yearly
prevalence of vitamin D deficiency. Differences also exist within
different nonwhite ethnic groups residing in the same country.
For example, within the Finnish Maamu representative sample,
the Kurdish immigrant subgroup (n = 500) had a much higher
prevalence of yearly serum 25(OH)D ,30 nmol/L (50.4%) than
the Somali immigrant subgroup (28.0%; n = 364), and both were
much higher than either the Russian-speaking white immigrant
subgroup (4.5%; n = 446) in Maamu or the general Finnish
native white adult population as studied in the representative
Health 2011 survey (37) (0.4%; n = 4102). Although not as-
sessed in the present analysis, the subjects of Kurdish origin
(born in Iraq or Iran) in the present study generally have, on
average, a lighter skin pigmentation than those of Somali origin,
highlighting that skin color is only part of the reason for lower
vitamin D status in certain ethnic groups and that other (dietary,
cultural, and biologic) factors influence the prevalence of vita-
min D deficiency. As an additional insight, although cognizant
of the fact that the numbers were low and thus caution is needed
in their interpretation, the current analysis of standardized serum
25(OH)D from the United Kingdom’s NDNS (all subjects)
showed that the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency was 35.7%
and 59.6% in black (n = 28) and Asian participants (n = 52),
respectively, compared with 19.6% in white participants (n =
1359). Standardized serum 25(OH)D data for South Asian
(Pakistani) immigrants in Oslo, Norway, also highlight an ex-
tremely high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (64.8%, n =
176) relative to that in the white native adult population (1.3%,
n = 866) (37). European teenagers, aged 15–18 y, seemed to
exhibit a higher prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (range:
12.2–39.6%) than did other age groups (range: 0.9–19.6%),
a phenomenon observed previously (52–54). It is worth noting
that none of the studies included pregnant women or older adults
in care homes, both life-stage groups that are considered vul-
nerable to vitamin D deficiency. In general, sex differences in
the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency within the collection of
population studies were not very pronounced compared with
ethnic and some age-grouping differences. Thus, risk of vitamin
D deficiency was largely similar in males and females of both
young and older European populations.
The key strengths of this study were the inclusion of the 18
representative European population studies of children, teen-
agers, adults, and older adults, representing a sizable geo-
graphical footprint with 55,844 total participants, and our ability
to standardize their serum 25(OH)D data so as to better quantify
the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in Europe and inform
development of prevention policies. In terms of limitations of this
study, it is worth noting that some of the studies were 7–11 y old,
and vitamin D supplement and/or fortified food usage patterns
and formulations as well as adherence to sun awareness cam-
paigns since that time may have altered, which would affect
these estimates.
In conclusion, vitamin D deficiency is evident throughout the
European population at prevalence rates that are a matter of
concern and that require action both from a public health and
a clinical perspective. What direction these strategies take will
depend on risk managers. Although there have been some
guidelines on sun exposure (55), the question of whether a
minimal-risk approach to UV-B exposure would enable vitamin
D production without increasing the risk of skin cancer is still
outstanding. It is the view of this consortium that these factors re-
emphasize the need for public health strategies to explore food-
based solutions for prevention of vitamin D deficiency. The pros
and cons of vitamin D supplementation and/or food fortification
have been well documented in recent times (49, 56–58). Finally,
