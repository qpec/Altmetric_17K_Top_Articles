The objective of this study was to examine the association between perseverative
cognition in the form of work-related rumination, and heart rate variability (HRV). We
tested the hypothesis that high ruminators would show lower vagally mediated HRV
relative to low ruminators during their leisure time. Individuals were classified as being
low (n = 17) or high ruminators (n = 19), using the affective scale on the work-related
rumination measure. HRV was assessed using a wrist sensor band (Microsoft Band 2).
HRV was sampled between 8 pm and 10 pm over three workday evenings (Monday
to Wednesday) while individuals carried out their normal evening routines. Compared
to the low ruminators, high affective ruminators demonstrated lower HRV in the form
of root mean square successive differences (RMSSDs), relative to the low ruminators,
indicating lower parasympathetic activity. There was no significant difference in heart
rate, or activity levels between the two groups during the recording periods. The current
findings of this study may have implications for the design and delivery of interventions
to help individuals unwind post work and to manage stress more effectively. Limitations
and implications for future research are discussed.
Keywords: work-related rumination, heart rate variability, unwinding from work, recovery
INTRODUCTION
Perseverative cognition has been conceptualized as ‘‘the repeated or chronic activation of the
cognitive representation of stress-related content’’ (Brosschot et al., 2005). Consistently, studies
have shown that it may not be the actual stressors themselves that cause health issues but that it is
the continued mental representation of the stressor/s—in the absence of the actual stressor—that
is the main contributor. Prolonged perseverative cognition has been associated with a range of
negative physical (Brosschot et al., 2006, 2010; Verkuil et al., 2010; Ottaviani et al., 2016), and
psychological conditions (Garnefski and Kraaij, 2006; Aldao et al., 2010).
The fundamental principle of the perseverative cognition hypothesis is that disease risk is
increased when individuals continue to experience unwanted mental representation of a stressful
situation, which in turn elicits prolonged physiological arousal. There are many different possible
stressors (e.g., work, home, private); in the present article, we focus solely on the role of mental
presentations associated with work, in the form of work-related rumination. Work-related
rumination has been defined as a thought or thoughts directed to issues relating to work,

that is/are repetitive in nature (Cropley and Zijlstra, 2011). For
example, a worker may ruminate about an important project
deadline, an unfinished task, stress over a future meeting, or
they may perseverate about something negative that was said to
them by their line manager or colleague at work (Cropley and
Millward, 2009; Syrek et al., 2016).
Workers need to psychologically detach and unwind from
the demands of work during their leisure time to replenish
lost resources that were expended at work (Meijman et al.,
1998). Delayed psychological recovery in terms of repetitive or
ruminative thinking about work has been associated with a range
of health complaints (Pravettoni et al., 2007; Gustafsson et al.,
2008; Rydstedt et al., 2009; Sonnentag et al., 2010; Querstret
and Cropley, 2012; Cropley et al., 2013), but importantly,
and of relevance for the present study, failure to unwind
from work has been associated with increased cardiovascular
disease risk (Suadicani et al., 1993; van Amelsvoort et al.,
2003; Kivimäki et al., 2006). For example, a prospective study
by Suadicani et al. (1993) found that men who reported an
inability to relax after work had an approximately threefold
increased risk of Ischemeic heart disease. Another study of
788 industrial workers found that incomplete recovery at
weekends was predictive of cardiovascular death (Kivimäki et al.,
2006). What was interesting about this study was that the
initial cohort was free from cardiovascular disease and that the
findings remained significant after controlling for conventional
risk factors, including age, sex, cholesterol, systolic pressure,
body mass index, smoking, physical inactivity, fatigue and job
stress.
The exact mechanism underlying the association between
work-related rumination and cardiovascular disease risk is
not clear; however, two distinct pathways may be involved:
the behavioral and the physiological. The behavioral pathway
can
be
influenced
by
many
factors
such
as
leading
a
sedentary lifestyle, drinking alcohol to excess, smoking and
moderating eating habits, and there is some evidence to
suggest that high work-related ruminators consume more foods
that contain saturated fats and sugars than low ruminators
(Cropley et al., 2012). Regarding the physiological pathway,
although not fully understood, two involuntary branches of
the autonomic nervous system appear to be closely involved
in the progression from stress to disease: the sympathetic and
the parasympathetic nervous systems. When the body is under
threat or stressed, sympathetic activity (or parasympathetic
withdrawal) mobilizes the organism for action by initiating
physiological arousal, such as increasing blood pressure, heart-
rate, catecholamine and corticosteroid secretion. In the absence
of threat or perceived stress, the parasympathetic system
counteracts the effects of sympathetic activity and restores
homeostasis. These two mechanisms serve to protect the
organism in the short-term but can have damaging effects
if stress is prolonged such as when people perseverate about
work matters.
There are various ways to assess autonomic nervous system
activity and many of these are quite intrusive. However, one
non-invasive marker that is the subject of this article is heart
rate variability (HRV). HRV is considered as an objective,
discreet measure of vagally mediated cardiac regulation and a
predictor of cardiac disease risk (Tsuji et al., 1996; Hansson
and Jönsson, 2006). As a proxy for prefrontally modulated and
vagally mediated cortico-cardiac interaction, HRV is thought
to be a marker for emotional regulation, responding when
individuals are under mental stress (Appelhans and Luecken,
2006; Heponiemi et al., 2006; Thayer and Lane, 2009; Geisler
et al., 2010; Forkmann et al., 2016). Vagally mediated HRV can
therefore be construed as an indicator of how well people regulate
their emotions (Koval et al., 2013).
The purpose of the present study was to examine the
effects of perseverative cognition in the form of work-related
rumination on HRV. There are a number of studies that have
examined rumination and HRV (Ottaviani et al., 2016), but to
our knowledge, and following a review of the literature, only
one study has examined the effects of work-related rumination
on HRV (Vahle-Hinz et al., 2014). Vahle-Hinz et al. (2014)
assessed the effects of work stress, work-related rumination,
sleep and nocturnal HRV on a work day and over the weekend.
No significant associations were observed between work-related
rumination and nocturnal HRV on a workday, although
work-related rumination measured on Saturday evening was
related to nocturnal HRV. However, it was a positive predictor,
suggesting greater HRV with high rumination. As the authors
state, this finding is quite perplexing, and although they present
a rational argument for why this is, they also offer some
compelling limitations which could have attributed to these
results. In their study, rumination was only measured by one
item, ‘‘Today I had to think about work-related problems at
home’’ and as the authors point out this only assessed whether
workers thought about work in the evening or not, whereas
HRV seems to be particularly sensitive to emotional regulation.
It was their suggestion that future research should include
measures of rumination that explicitly assess affective reactions
related to work.
To this end, the present study investigated the association
between work-related rumination and HRV over three evenings.
Following Vahle-Hinz et al. (2014) suggestion, we chose a
measure of affective rumination by Cropley et al. (2012).
This measure specifically assesses affective reactions related to
thinking about work. It was predicted that individuals reporting
high affective work-related rumination would demonstrate lower
HRV during a workday evening relative to low ruminators. In
order to test this hypothesis, we captured continuous data from
a wrist band photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor, first passing
the sensor data through a paired smartphone and then uploading
to a cloud instance, where further analysis could be performed.
To our knowledge, this is the first study to use wrist band PPG in
order to capture HRV data in a field study.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Sample and Participants
The sample was recruited from a financial sector organization
(BNP Paribas) in collaboration with AXA/PPP, who made it
possible for us to interact directly with the employee population.

Rumination and HRV: A Field Study
Participants were drawn from a larger cohort of full-time
working adults. One hundred and ninety-five individuals
(F = 29.8%, M = 70.2%) with an age range of 20–62 years
(M = 38.69, SD = 9.44) completed the affective subscale of the
work-related rumination questionnaire and low (n = 55) and
high (n = 49) ruminators were identified using quartile splits.
As both HRV and tendencies to ruminate have been known to
be affected by age (Britton et al., 2007; Sütterlin et al., 2012;
Vahle-Hinz et al., 2014), we restricted the upper age eligibility
to 45 years. Due to missing data (due to removal of the band
from the wrist, signal loss and movement artifacts), the final
sample consisted of 19 high ruminators (mean age 34.3 years,
SD = 6.7 years, 31.6% females) and 17 low ruminators (mean age
33.3 years, SD = 6.55 years, 17.6% females).
Work Related Rumination
The affective rumination subscale of the work related rumination
questionnaire
was
used
to
assess
people’s
perseverative
cognitions about work (Cropley et al., 2012). Items are responded
to on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 = ‘‘Very seldom/never,
seldom, sometimes, often to 5 = Very often/always’’, e.g., ‘‘Are
you troubled by work-related issues when not at work?’’;
This measure has been used in a number of previous studies
(Querstret and Cropley, 2012; Querstret et al., 2016), and has
shown good reliability and validity (Querstret and Cropley, 2012;
Syrek et al., 2016).
Heart Rate Variability Assessment
The Microsoft Band v2 was selected to capture interbeat intervals
because it exposes peak-to-peak (PP) intervals (the duration
of every detected heartbeat) through its developer SDK, while
most wearables only provide average heart rate, and from which
we can derive HRV. Whilst deriving HRV from PPG data is
quite novel, there is a precedent for ECG/PPG correlation when
looking at HRV data (Selvaraj et al., 2008). Moreover, the device
can be programmed to turn on and off the sensors without any
explicit interaction with the user, i.e., accelerometer and heart
rate sensors can be turned on and off while the user is sleeping,
which makes it possible to acquire and analyze data without the
potential bias introduced by interaction, which can in itself be a
form of intervention. We created an app for iOS, that pairs with
the Microsoft Band v2, and periodically collects the data from the
sensors, and uploads the collected data to our cloud, for analysis.
We implemented an algorithmic policy to balance the amount
of captured data and battery consumption to better preserve
battery life. The heart rate was captured for three consecutive
minutes (in order to acquire a continuous stream of PP data
long enough to ensure a minimum level of validity in HRV
analysis), then turned off for 3 min (to avoid depleting the battery
unnecessarily). Accelerometry data was measured along HRV to
assess movement. The accelerometer was periodically turned on
for 15 s, then turned off for 45 s. The accelerometer captures
data from a triaxial accelerometer and a triaxial gyroscope, at a
sampling frequency of 60 Hz. To keep the communication from
the smartphone to the cloud to a minimum, we uploaded a small
cluster of statistical features of the accelerometer data, instead
of all the raw data. The uploaded features provided sufficient
information to allow us to discriminate between user activities
(still, walking, running, automotive, other). The Microsoft Band’s
PPG sensor is heavily affected by motion artifacts. To account
for this, we filtered the collected heart rate data retaining only
the data collected when the accelerometer reported ‘‘stationary’’
activity, discarding the data collected while the accelerometer
reported ‘‘walking’’, ‘‘running’’, ‘‘automotive’’ or ‘‘other’’. This
filtering step was necessary to ensure that the collected data did
not contain noise that would have corrupted the subsequent
HRV analysis.
Procedure
The Ethics Committee of the University of Surrey granted a
favorable ethical opinion for the research. Information about
the study was circulated via the intranet. Interested participants
within BNPP were provided with further written information,
and once consented, completed the affective work-related
rumination measure online. Individuals who chose to participate
were each sent a wrist band that was paired to their company-
issued smartphone, with an instruction sheet on how to use them
together. They were also provided with a help line to a research
assistant who could guide them through the set-up procedure
if needed. No additional considerations are appropriate as
participants were otherwise healthy adults in full time work.
Individuals were asked to wear the wristband continually (apart
from when bathing). As research shows that people ruminate
about work issues more at the beginning of the week compared
to the rest of the week (Cropley, 2015) the analysis presented
here represents data collected over three weekday evenings
(Monday–Wednesday). Theoretically, HRV can be modulated by
voluntary actions which could bias the results for example, by
practicing breathing exercises individuals can deliberately reduce
their heart rate (and improve their HRV); individuals were
therefore asked to behave as they normally would during their
leisure time, and no self-management intervention or visibility
over the data collected was offered during this data collection
period.
Heart Rate Variability Analysis
All data were screened for measurement artifacts using
ARTiiFACT software (Kaufmann et al., 2011). Artifacts were
identified using the algorithm developed by Berntson et al.
(1990) by identification of a distribution-based threshold value
calculated for each individual. Flagged beat intervals were
visually checked and if confirmed as artifacts deleted and
substituted by means of cubic spline interpolation of neighboring
intervals. The time-domain measure root mean square successive
difference (RMSSD), which is considered to indicate vagally
mediated HRV, was calculated for each person. Measurements
and analyses followed established guidelines (Task Force of the
European Society of Cardiology and the North American Society
of Pacing and Electrophysiology, 1996).
Previous work has demonstrated that most workers do not
instantaneously switch off as soon as they stop working, but
gradually cognitively disengage and relax over the course of
the evening (Cropley and Millward Purvis, 2003; Cropley et al.,
2006). To ensure that individuals were given adequate time

Rumination and HRV: A Field Study
to disengage from work, HRV measurements were sampled
between an 8 pm and 10 pm window (10 pm was chosen
as the upper time period to minimize the possibility of
individuals being asleep when the HRV data was sampled). A
continuous 3-min stream of PP data was captured for analysis
for each individual as close to 8 pm as possible, alongside
concomitant accelerometer data. Prior to analysis, the data was
screened for normality and RMSSD was found to be normally
distributed. Data analysis was conducted using between groups
ANOVAs.

(M = 139.0; SD = 45.819) relative to the low ruminators
(M = 178.1; SD = 63.501), F = 4.556, p < 0.02, η2 = 0.18. There
was no significant difference between the groups with respect
to physical activity (0.993, SD = 0.276, vs. 0.992, SD = 0.022),
nor was there a significant difference in the time during the
evening when HRV was sampled (20.21, SD = 0.36, vs. 20.24,
SD = 0.30). Finally, there was no significant difference in heart
rate between the two groups (M = 78.539; SD = 11.647, vs. 82.953;
SD = 12.592), F = 1.194, ns, η2 = 0.03. When the analysis was
repeated controlling for age and gender, the overall pattern of the
results was unchanged.
DISCUSSION
Research has demonstrated that irregularity of heartbeat intervals
is an important marker of health (Kemp and Quintana, 2013).
This study adds to this literature as rumination was associated
with reduced HRV, which is a known indicator of cardiovascular
disease risk (Tsuji et al., 1996). As predicted, individuals
reporting high affective rumination were found to demonstrate
lower HRV compared to low ruminators. As vagally mediated
HRV is recognized as an indicator of how well people regulate
their emotions, this suggests that high affective ruminators
are less able to regulate their emotional thoughts about work
after work, reflecting lower parasympathetic activity during the
working week.
To our knowledge, this was the first study to pair wearable
sensors with smartphones with a particular focus on examining
the association between work-related rumination and HRV.
There was noise in the data, which is to be expected when
collecting the data in the field, and this led to a loss in sample
size and power. Also, data capture was limited to avoid depleting
the battery unnecessarily. As it is theoretically possible for people
to modulate their HRV, it was deemed important for participants
to behave normally during their evenings and not to deliberately
practice breathing exercises, as this could have potentially biased
the findings. Given that there is inherent and unavoidable loss of
data introduced by movement in PPG-acquired HR signal, it may
be advisable for future studies to design data collection methods
that incorporate periods of passivity, where continuous measures
can be taken while participants are completely sedentary, or
to use larger samples in order to compensate for the loss of
power. In field work, it is impossible to have the same level of
control as in the laboratory, and a compromise will always be
needed.
Although comparable in size to other HRV studies (Steinmetz
et al., 2016; Wojniusz et al., 2016) the current findings were
based on a relatively small sample size, and in addition
the HRV data was high for both groups, therefore some
caution needs to be exercised in the interpretation of the
results until the findings are replicated in larger samples. In
addition, we did not control for potential confounding factors
such as smoking, exercise, use of medication or somatic and
psychological illness. Future field studies should include these
potential confounders of current health status and health-related
behaviors.
As the study had a quasi-experimental design, causality
cannot be inferred from the data; nonetheless, the study may have
clinical implications. HRV biofeedback has seen a resurgence in
recent years, and biofeedback interventions have been shown to
be effective in individuals with emotional disturbance (Wheat
and Larkin, 2010). Interventions that include mindfulness
breathing exercises have also been shown to reduce work-related
rumination (Hülsheger et al., 2014; Querstret et al., 2016). It
is now possible for mobile health interventions to incorporate
biofeedback breathing exercises to help people regulate their
emotions during acute periods of stress. mHealth interventions
providing this kind of physiological monitoring can offer
increased fidelity, portability and functionality over traditional
home-based biofeedback monitors (Luxton et al., 2011), and
an increasing number of studies show evidence supporting the
greater use of technological innovations in psychological care
(Hollis et al., 2015). Early precedents for vagal modulation as a
self-management mechanism for stress (Benson et al., 1974) have
been reinforced by more recent work in neurocardiac training for
hypertension to enhance vagal heart control (Nolan et al., 2005).
Future research might examine whether such interventions
could be incorporated alongside HRV data collection methods
to provide instant feedback to users, improving their efficacy,
and potentially incorporating findings from computational
intelligence research in affect modeling for gameplay (Plans and
Morelli, 2012) to have intervention content adapt in real-time to
user affect.
Ruminating about work has been associated with negative
health and increased risk of disease. To our knowledge, this is the
first study to demonstrate an association between a trait marker
of work-related rumination and a short-term HRV parameter.
This was also the first study to pair smartphone technology
with a wearable wristband to record HRV during daily life.
The current study is not void of limitations; nonetheless, it
does provide further support for the role of HRV as a proxy
indicator for how well people regulate their emotions outside
of work, and also shows that failure to unwind from work
is a possible risk factor for the development of cardiovascular
disease.
