Preparing for Preprints
Bernd Pulverer
Preprints reduce delays in sharing research
results
and
increase
the
amount
and
diversity of data available to the scientific
community. Support of this communica-
tion
mechanism
through
appropriate
policies by journals, funders and institu-
tions will encourage community engage-
ment. Widespread adoption would benefit
both individual scientists and research,
and
it
might
improve
publishing
in
scientific journals. Preprints are one step
towards an Open Science future.
Preprint promise
S
cientific
research
is
a
communal
activity
and
progress
depends
on
cooperation—the
proverbial

work is built on the shoulders of giants. . .”
should be complemented with “. . . and
continual discussion and collaboration with
colleagues”.
For
a
long
time,
scientific
conferences
have
provided
a
forum
for
exchanging emergent research. Tradition-
ally, this exchange happened before publica-
tion—presenting retrospectives of published
work
at
conferences
would
have
been
considered gauche. Now, competitive pres-
sures and accelerating discovery rates risk
turning
collaborative
workshops
into
marketing platforms to showcase research
achievements.
Preprints
offer
a
formal
extension
of
conferences
for
the
open
exchange of prepublication research, with
the benefit of a global reach and the formal
documentation of research output.
In the physical sciences, preprints have
been de rigueur for a quarter of a century—
the majority of research across a wide spec-
trum of disciplines is first posted on arXiv as
non-peer-reviewed manuscripts (Ginsparg,
2016); in engineering and computer science,
conference
proceedings
fulfill
a
similar
role. Thus, more than 100,000 research
manuscripts annually on arXiv are open to
comments from colleagues, which fosters
collaboration and helps scientists to improve
manuscripts before they are submitted to a
peer-reviewed journal.
Because preprints are stably archived,
dated,
and
citable,
they
provide
formal
evidence for research activity, often well in
advance of the published paper. Given the
widespread use of arXiv, researchers are
aware of what colleagues are working on and
can adapt their own research accordingly. If
someone exploits privileged information to
their own advantage, the community will
know about it as the evidence is there for all
to see. In physics, preprints are therefore seen
as leveling the playing field, rather than
providing a competitive advantage to those
who keep their findings close to their chest.
arXiv coexists symbiotically with jour-
nals: Most research posted as a preprint is
ultimately destined for formal peer review
and publication (Ginsparg, 2016). Often,
preprints are first revised and reposted as a
new version either before or in parallel with
journal submission. As a result, more mature
work is submitted to journals and the peer
review
process
is
consequently
more
straightforward. Publishing is distinctly less
painful in physics. Journals continue to
thrive as they constitute the formal “point of
record” for a research project and carry
weight in research assessment.
Open science
Peer review is a powerful quality assurance
mechanism.
Undoubtedly,
the
system
is
subject to stresses in the biological sciences
both on account of the exponential expan-
sion of the number of research papers and
the increasing pressure to publish in only a
small subset of journals that meet ambitious
bibliometric targets set by research institu-
tions and funders (Pulverer, 2015a).
Valuable results that do not make it into
prestigious journals fall below the radar of
research assessment and are often not visible
to other researchers. Much research is never
published in the first place—this can include
perfectly robust and reproducible negative
data, confirmatory data, and data at odds
with published findings. It can also include
descriptive datasets and other resources. A
fundamental
tenet
of
hypothesis-driven
research is that the hypothesis is tested
experimentally. This can and should result
in many hypotheses failing, but this does
not negate the value of the results. Often
these
datasets
are
in
fact
particularly
compelling, yet such “negative” data do not
succeed in the selection process of journals
that focus on impactful science.
It is entirely understandable that journals
that aim to reach a broad readership select
research of broad interest that presents a
sizeable conceptual advance. However, if
reliable data that do not fit these editorial
criteria remain invisible, the efficacy of
scientific research will suffer. Scientists will
repeat unreported experiments, while others
rely on results that may not stand the test of
time, because contradictory data are not
shared. The literature is littered with such
papers and the argument that “everyone in
the community knows which papers are not
to be trusted” will only ever apply to the
most visible findings as more than 1 million
papers are published every year.
To be sure, there are many well-respected
community journals happy to publish high-
quality
data
of
more
specialist
interest.
There are also journals that have explicitly
dropped “conceptual advance” as an edito-
rial criterion, a concept first applied by PLOS
One
which
has
since
spread
rapidly,
partially because it can function as an
engine of open access publishing business
models. Furthermore, preprints add to a
number of existing platforms that allow

 sharing of more or less structured data, such
as Dryad, figshare, Zenodo, and BioStudies
(McEntyre et al, 2015). Incentives to engage
with these platforms remain limited—the
ball is in the court of funders and institu-
tions to change their research assessment
processes if they value this research (Pulverer,
2015a).
Solving the time discontinuum
Preprints
diminish
the
delay
between
discovery and dissemination of results. Jour-
nal-based publishing struggles to keep up
with the rapid speed of biomedical research.
This
is
most
apparent
where
speed
is
dictated by public health, for example, to
address
the
latest
pandemic
threat.
A
number of journals, including this one, have
committed to release relevant data openly
and with minimal delay (Isom, 2016).
Still, most research papers need many
months to navigate the editorial process.
The problem is compounded by pressure to
publish at all costs in high-impact journals,
leading
to
systemic
serial
submissions.
This time gap is not merely frustrating to
researchers, but can also compromise the
novelty of their work and lead to redun-
dant research. The EMBO publications and
a few others have managed to minimize
these delays by applying peer review only
to manuscripts with a real chance of publi-
cation, by restricting revision to realistic,
essential, and well-defined experimentation,
and by offering manuscript transfers
to
other journals where appropriate (Pulverer,
2014). Nonetheless, it is essentially impos-
sible to publish in a high-quality peer-
reviewed publication in less than a handful
of months without compromising on qual-
ity.
Preprints
address
this
problem
by
moving the initial dissemination of findings
closer to their discovery.
Commenting and quality control
A central promise of preprints is that it
improves shared research on account of
constructive commenting in an open form
or via direct peer-to-peer communication
(Ginsparg,
2016).
The
biology
preprint
platform
bioRxiv
reports
that
10%
of
preprints
receive
open
comments,
but
most discourse happens via social media
and e-mail, and one-third of the preprints
are
revised
and
60%
subsequently
published.
The jury is still out on how to best ensure
preprints do not allow dissemination of
misleading, ethically compromised, plagia-
rized, false, or outright dangerous informa-
tion. Currently, minimal checks are applied
at bioRxiv to ensure posts conform to basic
standards and arXiv is working on auto-
mated screening (Ginsparg, 2016). Clearly,
applying peer review to weed out flawed
contributions
would
defeat
the
purpose.
Peer
review
by
selective
journals
will
remain
an
important
quality
assurance
mechanism; manuscripts posted on bioRxiv
automatically
forward-link
to
papers
published in EMBO Press journals as the
point of record.
Staking claims or salami slicing
Preprints are formally citable and provide a
time stamp for claims of discovery. All
EMBO publications encourage citation of
preprints where appropriate in the reference
list. We are working on a standard to ensure
that
citations
to
preprints
are
on
the
same footing as references to peer-reviewed
papers,
while
also
signalling
“non-peer
reviewed—proceed with due caution”. In
our view, it is better to share science in two
forms: carefully peer reviewed and not peer
reviewed than the “modest peer review and
quality control” that many journals can
muster now in the face of pressure to
publish more at lower costs.
What protects preprinters from being
scooped?
Conversely,
what
prevents
preprinters from posting work prematurely
to claim a discovery? In physics, the time
stamp of preprints protects from scooping
and the community disfavors cooperation
with
those
who
exploit
the
system
(Ginsparg, 2016). As Ron Vale, initiator of
the ASAPbio coalition for preprints, notes
“why would I post lower quality work that
could
compromise
my
reputation?”
In
contrast to presenting unpublished work at
conferences to an unknown audience who
often tweet results in real time, preprints
formally document research advances.
Extended scooping protection
Many reputable journals allow or encourage
preprint posting of primary research.
EMBO
publications
will
not
consider
preprints in the evaluation of the conceptual
advance
of
submitted
manuscripts
and
encourages posting before—or in parallel
with—submission to the journal. Reviews,
commentaries, and versions of articles that
have
been
revised
to
address
referee
comments and accepted for publication or
published, should not be posted.
The
EMBO
publications
have
long
promulgated their scooping protection policy
for submitted manuscripts and during revi-
sion. EMBO Press has now gone one step
further to extend scooping protection to the
day of posting the preprint version of the
manuscript (http://emboj.embopress.org/au
thorguide#preprintservers). We hope this
will encourage researchers to post their
work as a preprint. We hope in particular
that it encourages younger scientists to have
the confidence to post preprints – for them
the stakes are highest, but they also gain the
most as preprints allow them to document
research formally and in time for the next
application for a grant or position.
Back to the future
Preprints may become an important part in
an Open Science future, encouraging the
open and transparent sharing of research
findings with minimal delay. Preprints that
are broadly visible and that matter for
research assessment will depressurize the
rush to publish at all costs, allowing quality
journals to invest time and effort to add relia-
bility
and
reproducibility
assurances
to
research findings through careful peer review
and prepublication quality control and cura-
tion processes (Pulverer, 2015a,b; Vale &
Pulverer, 2016). If preprints should attain the
dominant
role
they
have
in
physics,
publishing papers in journals may remain
attractive only in journals that add real value
to the scientific communication process. This
may
spur
investment
or
contract
the
publishing landscape, freeing resources.
In need of carrots
Why is everyone using preprints in physics,
while
anxiety
still
trumps
in
biology?
Even though physical disciplines can be
more contained than sprawling fields such
as “cancer biology”, competition can be as
high and funding as competitive. One crucial
difference is that physicists have grown up
with arXiv: it is universal and fully embed-
ded in the scientific process. Since everyone
is using it, the playing field is level.
A
crucial
incentive to post
preprints
ought to be that researchers are thus also

 able to view proportionally much more data
from colleagues. There is a clear net benefit
in sharing one’s own work more system-
atically if only enough others do it.
Nonetheless, without appropriate incen-
tives, biomedical researchers will remain
reluctant to share results. To get to this
point,
it
will
be
necessary
to
provide
tangible incentives. EMBO Press’s “extended
scooping protection” is one.
It
is
ultimately
up
to
funders
and
institutions—EMBO encourages applicants
for fellowships to include preprints (see
http://www.embo.org/documents/LTF/LTF_
Guidelines_for_Applicants.pdf).
Scientific exchange has to become more
cooperative and open. Even in a hypercom-
petitive environment, this will benefit every-
one. Let us see whether the biosciences
community can
pull together to bolster
prepublication exchange and thus catch up
with physics. It will take reassurances and
incentives from journals and funders to
support those scientists who “risk it”.
