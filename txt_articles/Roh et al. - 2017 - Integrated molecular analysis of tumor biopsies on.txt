Immune checkpoint blockade produces clinical benefit in many patients. However, better biomarkers of response
are still needed, and mechanisms of resistance remain incompletely understood. To address this, we recently studied
a cohort of melanoma patients treated with sequential checkpoint blockade against cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen–4
(CTLA-4) followed by programmed death receptor–1 (PD-1) and identified immune markers of response and
resistance. Building on these studies, we performed deep molecular profiling including T cell receptor sequencing
and whole-exome sequencing within the same cohort and demonstrated that a more clonal T cell repertoire was
predictive of response to PD-1 but not CTLA-4 blockade. Analysis of CNAs identified a higher burden of copy
number loss in nonresponders to CTLA-4 and PD-1 blockade and found that it was associated with decreased
expression of genes in immune-related pathways. The effect of mutational load and burden of copy number loss
on response was nonredundant, suggesting the potential utility of a combinatorial biomarker to optimize patient
care with checkpoint blockade therapy.
INTRODUCTION
Immune checkpoint blockade represents a major advancement in
cancer therapy for advanced melanoma. However, durable clinical re-
sponses are observed in only a minority of patients treated with single-
agent cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen–4 (CTLA-4) (1) or programmed
death receptor–1 (PD-1) blockade (2, 3). Although higher response
rates are achieved when CTLA-4 and PD-1 inhibitors are administered
concurrently, this regimen also has greatly increased toxicity (3, 4).
There is a clinical need to predict who will benefit from immunotherapy
and to understand mechanisms of therapeutic resistance to improve
patient management and outcomes. Recently, evidence has pointed to a
role of tumor molecular features (such as mutational load) (5–8) and
host immune infiltrates (9–12) in response to therapy, although com-
plexities exist with the predictive power of these markers (13). Studies
have also begun to uncover mechanisms of resistance, including ex-
pression of immune checkpoint molecules (10, 14–21), insufficient
infiltration of CD8+ T cells (9, 10), oncogenic pathways (22–24), tran-
scriptomic resistance signatures (25), lack of sensitivity to interferon
(IFN) signaling (26–30), defects in antigen processing and presentation
(11, 30–32), diversity and abundance of bacteria within the gut micro-
biome (33, 34), and metabolism of cancer cells and T cells (35–37).
However, additional insights are needed for a more comprehensive
understanding of resistance.
To further refine both host and tumor genomic contributions to
resistance to checkpoint blockade, we assembled a cohort of longitudi-
nal tissue samples from metastatic melanoma patients treated with
sequential immune checkpoint blockade (CTLA-4 blockade followed
by PD-1 blockade at time of progression). We previously performed deep
immune profiling studies on these samples (via immunohistochemistry
and gene expression profiling) and identified immune biomarkers of
response and mechanisms of therapeutic resistance (38). To com-
plement these studies, we report here the results of in-depth molecular
analysis [via whole-exome sequencing (WES) and T cell receptor (TCR)
sequencing (TCR-seq)] of these longitudinal samples. These studies
have identified putative genomic and molecular biomarkers of response
and resistance to immune checkpoint blockade, demonstrating the
complex interplay of host and tumor in treatment response.

 RESULTS
T cell clonality predicts response to PD-1 blockade but not
CTLA-4 blockade
We studied a cohort of 56 patients who were first treated with CTLA-4
blockade and then subsequently treated with PD-1 blockade at the time
of progression, with longitudinal tumor samples collected as previously
described (Fig. 1A and tables S1, A and B, and S2) (38) by performing
WESandTCR-seq on DNA fromavailable tumorsamples(Fig.1A, figs.
S1 and S2, and table S3). Responders were defined as patients who had
complete resolution or partial reduction in the size of tumors by com-
puterized axial tomography (CAT) scan–based imaging (by at least
30%) or who had prolonged stable disease (for at least 6 months). Non-
responders were defined as patients who had tumor growth of at least
20% on CAT scan or had stable disease lasting less than 6 months. We
first compared the mutation status of common melanoma driver genes
(39, 40) in pretreatment samples, also assessed IFN-g pathway genes
(given the importance of defects in IFN-g signaling in resistance to
immune checkpoint blockade) (30, 41–43), and found no significant
differences between responders and nonresponders to therapy with
regard to somatic point mutations or indels (Fisher’s exact test with a
false discovery rate threshold of 0.05) (Fig. 1B and table S4). Next, we
compared the frequency of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) somatic
mutations (44) in pretreatment samples and found that HLA somatic
mutations were found in only one pretreatment biopsy from a CTLA-4
blockade nonresponder (table S5). No particular genes were enriched for
mutations in post–PD-1 blockade samples except BRAF (V600E) (five
of six patients), potentially because of prolonged survival with interim
BRAF-targeted therapy in three of five patients (Fig. 1B and table S1B).
In our cohort, we did not observe any statistically significant differ-
ences in mutational load or predicted neoantigen load in pretreatment
samples from responders versus nonresponders to therapy by either
CTLA-4 or PD-1 blockade (fig. S3, A and B, and table S6) (mutational
load: P = 0.597 in pre–CTLA-4 blockade samples and P = 0.885 in pre–
PD-1 blockade samples; neoantigen load: P = 0.736 in pre–CTLA-4
blockade samples and P = 0.885 in pre–PD-1 blockade samples), which
is in contrast to published literature (5–8) and may be because of limited
sample size. Furthermore, no significant differences were observed in
intratumor heterogeneity (ITH), estimated as the number of clones per
tumor, between responders and nonresponders to immune checkpoint
blockade (fig. S4).
We next performed sequencing of the CDR3 variable region of the
b chain of the TCR (TCR-seq) to understand the role of the T cell
repertoire in response and resistance to checkpoint blockade (table
S7). Although no significant differences were observed in TCR clonality
when comparing responders to nonresponders in the context of CTLA-4
blockade at the pretreatment (P = 0.96) and on-treatment time points
(P = 0.2) (Fig. 1C), an increase in clonality was noted in a subset of pa-
tients treated with CTLA-4 blockade (fig. S5A). Among eight patients
with matched longitudinal tumor samples (pre–CTLA-4 and pre–PD-1;
n = 8) available, all three PD-1 blockade responders showed an increase
in TCR clonality on CTLA-4 blockade, whereas this was the case in only
one of five nonresponders to PD-1 blockade (fig. S5A). One patient
(patient 50)classifiedasanonresponderinthecontext of the trial criteria,
who demonstrated an increase in clonality, appeared to have some
clinical benefit from treatment with PD-1 blockade, as he continued on
PD-1 blockade therapy for a total of 24 doses and had no evidence of
disease at the last follow-up. Higher TCR clonality was observed in
responders to PD-1 blockade at both pretreatment (P = 0.041) and
on-treatment (P = 0.032) time points (Fig. 1C).
Next, we sought to investigate the association between TCR clonality
and immune activation in the tumor microenvironment. To do so, we
first calculated the immune score from gene expression profiling data
(38) in our cohort (table S8). The immune score was defined as the
geometric mean of gene expression in selected genes, including cyto-
lytic markers, HLA molecules, IFN-g pathway, selected chemokines,
and adhesion molecules related to tumor rejection in the context of the
immunologic constant of rejection (table S9) (45, 46). Although no
association was observed between TCR clonality and immune scores
in pre–CTLA-4 blockade samples, a significant positive correlation was
observedbetweenTCRclonalityandimmunescoresinpre–PD-1blockade
samples (P = 0.0018; fig. S5B).
High copy number loss burden is associated with poor
response to immune checkpoint blockade
Given the lack of clear differences in point mutation and indel status in
driver genes between responders and nonresponders to CTLA-4 and
PD-1 blockade, we then investigated whether copy number alterations
(CNAs) may play a role in response and resistance to CTLA-4 and PD-1
blockade (table S10). With regard to specific genes, we did not find any
significant association between copy number gain or loss status and
response to therapy in pretreatment biopsies for either therapy
(Fisher’s exact test with a false discovery rate threshold of 0.05). Given
a recent report demonstrating the impact of loss of HLA class I and
b2-microglobulininresistance to cytolytic activity(11),we nextexamined
the relevance of copy number loss in these genes within our cohort.
Here, although we observed no significant loss of HLA class I genes,
loss of b2-microglobulin was detected in fournonresponders to CTLA-4
blockade (with focal copy number loss in two patients and arm-level
copy number loss in two patients). Focal copy number loss of b2-
microglobulin was also observed in one pretreatment sample from a
CTLA-4 blockade–naïve PD-1 blockade responder. To assess CNAs
at the whole-genome sample level, we defined burden of CNAs as the
total number of genes with copy number gain or loss per sample (table
S2). On testing the association between burden of CNAs and response
to therapy in pretreatment biopsies of patients on CTLA-4 or PD-1
blockade, we observed no significant differences in burden of copy
number gain or loss (P > 0.05 for all comparisons) in the context of
individual agent response (fig. S6). However, a trend toward higher
burden of copy number loss was observed in pre–CTLA-4 blockade
biopsies from CTLA-4 blockade responders compared to CTLA-4
blockade nonresponders, although statistical significance was not at-
tained (P = 0.077).
We next investigated the burden of CNAs in pre–CTLA-4 blockade
biopsies from patients who progressed on CTLA-4 blockade first and
then progressed on PD-1 blockade, termed DNRs, because we hypothe-
sized that the association between burden of CNAsand resistance might
be stronger in patients with potentially more resistant phenotype (fail-
ure on both treatments) than in patients who failed a single agent. We
observed no significant differences in burden of copy number gain but
significantly higher burden of copy number loss in pre–CTLA-4 block-
ade biopsies from DNRs compared to pre–CTLA-4 blockade biopsies
from CTLA-4 blockade responders (P = 0.042) (Fig. 2A and fig. S7).
We noted a markedly higher burden of copy number loss in post–PD-1
blockade biopsies compared to pre–CTLA-4 blockade biopsies from
CTLA-4 blockade responders (P = 0.029) (Fig. 2A and fig. S7). The bur-
den of copy number loss was not correlated with mutational load at any
timepointsstudied(fig. S8), suggesting that the association isnotreadily
attributable to decreased mutational burden.

Fig. 1. Genomic landscape of serial tumor biopsies and genomic and immune correlates of treatment response. (A) Patients with metastatic melanoma were
initially treated with CTLA-4 blockade (n = 56; asterisk indicates that 2 of the 56 patients were CTLA-4 blockade–naïve). Both responded to PD-1 blockade, and only pretreatment
samples were available for WES and TCR-seq. Nonresponders (NRs) to CTLA-4 blockade (n = 47) were then treated with PD-1 blockade. Double nonresponders (DNRs) progressed
on CTLA-4 blockade first and then progressed on PD-1 blockade. Serial tumor biopsies were collected at multiple time points (pretreatment, early on-treatment, and progression
on CTLA-4 blockade and PD-1 blockade) when feasible. WES and TCR-seq were performed on these serial tumor biopsies. The numbers in parentheses indicate the number of
samplesavailable for responders (Rs)and nonrespondersafter quality controlof WES andTCR-seqdata. (B)For each sample (columns), genomic profiles (rows)were characterized.
Column annotations represent biopsy time (pre–aCTLA-4, pre–CTLA-4 blockade samples; pre–aPD-1, pre–PD-1 blockade samples; post–aPD-1, post–PD-1 blockade samples) and
response status (red, responders; blue, nonresponders; asterisk indicates failed CTLA-4 blockade but responded to PD-1 blockade) for each sample (sample ID denotes patient ID
followed by biopsy time: A, pre–aCTLA-4; C, post–CTLA-4/pre–PD-1; E, post–PD-1). Mutational burden and neoantigen burden for each sample are shown at the top of the panel.
Neoantigens were defined as having a median inhibitory concentration (IC50) <500 nM. Color scale shows the range of IC50 from 500 to 50 nM. Synonymous (light) and non-
synonymous (dark) mutations are shown in different shades of blue. Additional genomic profiles included selected somatic point mutations and indels. No indels were found
among melanoma driver genes. When multiple mutations were found in one gene, the following precedence rule was applied: nonsense mutation > frameshift indel > splice site
mutation > missense mutation > in-frame indel. (C) Boxplots summarize TCR clonality by response status (blue, nonresponders; red, responders) in pre–CTLA-4 blockade samples,
pre–PD-1 blockade samples, on–CTLA-4 blockade samples, and on–PD-1 blockade samples; median values (lines) and interquartile range (whiskers) are indicated. P values were
calculated using two-sidedMann-Whitney Utest (P >0.05for TCRclonalityinpre–CTLA-4blockade andon–CTLA-4blockade samples, P =0.041forTCRclonality in pre–PD-1blockade
samples, and P = 0.032 for TCR clonality in on–PD-1 blockade samples).

 To gain insight into mechanisms through which CNAs could influ-
ence response to therapy, we next investigated whether there were any
recurrent regions of copy number loss in DNRs with high burden of
copy number loss (>2000 genes with copy number loss). Recurrent copy
number loss was observed at the arm level in chromosomes 6q and 10q,
and recurrent focal copy number loss was observed in 8p23.3, 11p15.5,
11q23, 11q24, and 11q25 (Fig. 2B and table S11). In these regions with
recurrent copy number loss, tumor suppressor genes were located in
chromosomes 6q (FOXO3, PRDM1, PTPRK, TNFAIP3, and ESR1),
10q (NCOA4, BMPR1A, PTEN, FAS,
SUFU, and TCF7L2), and 11q23.3 (CBL
and ARHGEF12). These data suggest
that the high burden of copy number loss
in DNRs is associated with recurrent copy
number loss in tumor suppressor genes
located in chromosomes 6q, 10q, and
11q23.3.
An independent patient cohort
shows copy number loss as a
putative resistance mechanism
To investigate the impact of higher bur-
den of copy number loss on resistance
in another cohort of patients on immune
checkpoint blockade, we obtained WES
SAM files from 110 melanoma patients
and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data
from a subset of 42 melanoma patients
(7) and reanalyzed the data using the
same informatics pipeline and calling
criteria. Wethentestedtheassociation be-
tween the burden of CNAs (tables S12
and S13) and response to therapy in pre-
treatment biopsies on CTLA-4 blockade
using the same response criteria (clinical
benefit, long-term survival with no clini-
cal benefit, and minimal or no clinical
benefit), as previously described (7). Al-
though the burden of copy number gain
was not significantly associated with clin-
icalbenefit from CTLA-4 blockade, a low-
er burden of copy number loss was
significantly associated with clinical bene-
fit (P = 0.016) (Fig. 3A). As observed in
our cohort, the burden of copy number
loss once again did not correlate with mu-
tational load (fig. S9). When examining
the regions associated with recurrent copy
number loss in the no clinical benefit sub-
group, recurrent copy number loss was
observed at arm level in chromosomes
9p and 10q, and recurrent focal copy
number loss was observed in 4q35.2,
6q25, 6q27, and 11p15.5 (fig. S10 and ta-
ble S14). Among these regions, tumor sup-
pressor genes were observed in 6q25.1
(ESR1) and 10q (NCOA4, BMPR1A,
PTEN, FAS, and SUFU), as observed with-
in our cohort. Notably, no recurrent copy
number loss was observed in any tumor suppressor gene in the clinical
benefit and long-term survival subgroups.
Next, we investigated whether the recurrent region of copy number
loss identified in our cohort (table S11) is also associated with CTLA-4
blockade resistance in this independent cohort (Van Allen cohort). To
do so, we calculated the burden of copy number loss in this independent
cohort as the total number of genes with copy number loss in the recur-
rent regions of copy number loss identified in our cohort. We observed
a significantly higher burden of copy number loss in the minimal or no

Fig. 2. Copy number loss as a potential resistance mechanism. (A) Boxplots summarize burden of copy number
gain or loss in five groups of interest: responders to CTLA-4 blockade assessed before treatment, pre–CTLA-4 block-
ade DNRs, responders to PD-1 blockade assessed before treatment, pre–PD-1 blockade DNRs, and post–PD-1 block-
ade DNRs; median values (lines) and interquartile range (whiskers) are indicated. P values were calculated using
two-sided Mann-Whitney U test (P = 0.042 for pre–CTLA-4 blockade responders versus DNRs, P = 0.029 for pre–
CTLA-4 blockade responders versus post–PD-1 blockade DNRs, and P > 0.05 for all others). The pre–CTLA-4 blockade
and post–PD-1 blockade DNR groups are highlighted in bold. (B) Segment gain or loss (SGOL) scores were
calculated for each copy number segments as sum of log2 copy ratios (tumor/normal) of each copy number seg-
ment across all DNR samples with copy number loss burden higher than 2000 (n = 9). Higher positive SGOL scores
indicate higher copy number gain of copy number segments, and lower negative SGOL scores indicate higher copy
number loss of copy number segments. Tumor suppressor genes with recurrent copy number loss are indicated in
chromosomes 6q, 10q, and 11q23.3.

 clinical benefit groups compared to the clinical benefit group (P =
0.0034) (fig. S11). This result suggests that the recurrent regions of copy
number loss in our cohort are also associated with CTLA-4 blockade
resistance in this independent cohort.
We next sought to determine the relative contribution of copy num-
ber loss burden from chromosome 10 in CTLA-4 blockade resistance.
We were specifically interested in copy number loss from chromosome
10 because a recent study (47) showed functional evidence that recur-
rent loss of the entire chromosome 10 can result in collective repression
of multiple tumor suppressor genes. This is also consistent with the ob-
servation that chromosome 10 harbored the largest number of tumor
suppressor genes with recurrent copy number loss in both our cohort

Fig. 3. Copy number loss as a potential resistance mechanism in an independent cohort. (A) Boxplots summarize burden of copy number gain or loss in three
patient subgroups from the Van Allen cohort: clinical benefit, long-term survival with no clinical benefit, and minimal or no clinical benefit; median values (lines) and
interquartile range (whiskers) are indicated. P values were calculated using two-sided Mann-Whitney U test (P = 0.016 for burden of copy number loss in clinical benefit
versus minimal or no clinical benefit and P > 0.05 for all others). (B) Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) results show top enriched KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes
and Genomes) pathways from down-regulated genes (blue bars) and up-regulated genes (red bars) in high burden of copy number loss group versus low burden of
copy number loss group (false discovery rate–adjusted P < 0.001). (C) Proportions of patients with clinical benefit, long-term survival with no clinical benefit, and
minimal or no clinical benefit were calculated within each of the four patient subgroups: high mutational load and low burden of copy number loss, high mutational
load and high burden of copy number loss, low mutational load and low burden of copy number loss, and low mutational load and high burden of copy number loss.
The numbers in parentheses indicate the number of patients with different levels of response (clinical benefit, long-term survival, and no clinical benefit) out of the total
number of patients in each of the four patient subgroups.

 (Fig. 2B) and the independent cohort (fig. S10). The logistic regression
model showed that the odds of resistance to CTLA-4 blockade were
exp(1.504) = 4.5 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.56 to 13] times greater
inpatientswithhighburdenofcopynumberlossinchromosome10than
in patients with low burden of copy number loss in chromosome 10
(table S15A), and the odds of resistance were exp(1.069) = 2.91 (95%
CI, 1.07 to 7.89) times greater in patients with high burden of copy
number loss outside chromosome 10 than in patients with low burden
of copy number loss outside chromosome 10 (table S15B). Therefore,
the relative contribution of copy number loss burden from chromo-
some 10 in CTLA-4 blockade resistance was higher than copy number
loss burden outside chromosome 10. We further investigated the extent
to which PTEN loss in chromosome 10 is associated with CTLA-4
blockade resistance (24). In our data, the odds of resistance were 5.58
times greater in patients with PTEN loss than in patients with no PTEN
loss (95% CI, 1.19 to 26.20) (table S15C), suggesting that PTEN loss is
likely to be one of the driver resistance mechanisms exploited by tumors
with high burden of copy number loss on chromosome 10.
Integrated analysis reveals putative mechanisms through
which CNAs may influence response to therapy
In addition to studying the influence of copy number loss on molecular
features such as tumor suppressor genes, we sought to study the relation-
ship of these alterations with the immune tumor microenvironment. To
do so, we examined the correlation between burden of copy number
loss and immune scores. Although we observed no correlation between
the burden of copy number loss and immune scores in pre–CTLA-4
blockade biopsies in our cohort (correlation coefficient, −0.13; Spear-
man rank correlation, P = 0.79), a moderate negative correlation be-
tween the burden of copy number loss and immune scores calculated by
ESTIMATE (48) was identified in the Van Allen cohort (correlation
coefficient, −0.41; Spearman rank correlation, P = 0.011) (fig. S12A) (7).
In pre–PD-1 blockade biopsies in our cohort, we also observed a neg-
ative correlation between the burden of copy number loss and immune
scores (correlation coefficient, −0.63; Spearman rank correlation, P =
0.091) (fig. S12B), although this could not be investigated in post–
PD-1 blockade biopsies because of sample size. Our immune scores
and those calculated by ESTIMATE (table S16) showed a strong positive
correlation (correlation coefficient, 0.91; Spearman rank correlation, P <
2.2 × 10−16) in the independent cohort (fig. S12C), suggesting concor-
dance between immune scores.
We further sought to determine which pathways or gene ontologies
(GOs) were enriched in up- or down-regulated genes at the mRNA
expression level in the high burden of copy number loss groups (n =
10; mean, 4149; range, 2815 to 6764) versus the low burden of copy
number loss groups (n = 10; mean, 0) within the Van Allen cohort. GSEA
(49) showed that immune-related pathways were enriched among
down-regulated genes, whereas cell cycle–related pathways were
enriched among up-regulated genes (Fig. 3B, fig. S13A, and table S17,
A to C). Similar results were found with GO terms (fig. S13B and table
S17, A, D, and E). Collectively, these data suggest that high burden of
copy number loss may be associated with down-regulation of immune-
related pathways.
Mutational load and burden of copy number loss may allow
better patient stratification for response than either
correlate alone
Finally, we were interested in determining whether the effect of muta-
tional load and burden of copy number loss on clinical response were
nonredundant. Using the reanalyzed data from the Van Allen cohort,
we first stratified patients into four subgroups based on mutational
load (high or low) and burden of copy number loss (high or low)
(fig. S14). Within each subgroup, we then calculated the proportion
of patients with clinical benefit, long-term survival, and no clinical ben-
efit (Fig. 3C). The proportion of patients with clinical benefit was higher
in the subgroup of patients with high mutational load and low burden
of copy number loss (11 of 26) compared to the subgroup of patients
with low mutational load and high burden of copy number loss (4 of 26)
(P = 0.064, Fisher’s exact test). Similarly, the proportion of patients with
no clinical benefit was significantly higher in the subgroup of patients
with low mutational load and high burden of copy number loss (21 of
26) compared to the subgroup of patients with high mutational load
and low burden of copy number loss (13 of 26) (P = 0.04, Fisher’s
exact test). We then performed a logistic regression on response status
(clinical response or no clinical response) with the log2-transformed
mutational load and log2-transformed burden of copy number loss as
covariates and found an additive effect of mutational load (coefficient,
0.266; z = 1.939, P = 0.053) and burden of copy number loss (coefficient,
−0.149; z = −2.55, P = 0.011) on clinical response (table S18). This sug-
gests that the effects of mutational load and burden of copy number loss
on clinical response are likely nonredundant. Collectively, the above-
mentioned data demonstrate the potential utility of a combinatorial
biomarker using mutational load and copy number loss burden.
DISCUSSION
Now, there is abundant evidence that both tumor-related (5–8, 23, 24)
and host-related factors (9–12) can influence heterogeneous response
and resistance to immune checkpoint blockade. Here, we report ge-
nomic characterization of tumors from a cohort of metastatic melano-
ma patients in the context of sequential immune checkpoint blockade.
This study builds on our previous immune profiling of tumors within
the same cohort of metastatic melanoma patients (38), allowing for a
more integrated analysis in this particular cohort.
In tumor compartment–specific analyses, we observed a higher
burden of copy number loss in nonresponders compared to responders
on CTLA-4 blockade. This finding is in line with those in previous
studies that have reported that the burden of CNAsincreases in advanced
melanoma and is implicated in melanoma progression (50–53). The
association between burden of copy number loss and clinical response
observed here suggests that melanoma progression may be associated
with resistance to immune-mediated tumor control. Furthermore,
investigation of the findings reported here in a first-line treatment
setting will help delineate the value of these potential associations.
We also identified genomic regions of recurrent copy number loss
in patients with high burden of copy number loss and determined that
several tumor suppressor genes were located within these genomic
regions. This suggests that loss of function in these tumor suppressor
genes could potentially influence therapeutic resistance. In keeping
with this suggestion, previous studies in preclinical models of melano-
ma with PTEN loss showed inhibition of T cell–mediated tumor killing
and decrease in T cell trafficking into tumors (24). PTEN was one of the
tumor suppressor genes with recurrent copy number loss from patients
withhigh burden of copy numberlossin this study aswell.A correlation
between copy number loss burden and down-regulation of immune-
related gene expression was found, suggesting that there may be gene
expression sequelae of extensive copy number loss, including PTEN
loss. More extensive analyses on larger cohorts with matched WES

 and RNA-seq data are needed to expand on these findings and de-
velop an integrated expression/copy number evaluation approach to
validate and potentially exploit the correlation observed here.
We also observed that the effects of low copy number loss burden
and high mutational load on clinical response are nonredundant,
suggesting the possibility of a combinatorial biomarker using copy
number loss burden and mutational load. From a clinical perspective,
the optimal cutoffs for high or low copy number loss burden and
mutational load will need to be further validated whether they are to
affect improved patient stratification in the clinical setting.
Our work also confirms previous reports that TCR clonality is
correlated with response to PD-1 blockade (10). A combinatorial bio-
marker approach of TCR clonality and genomic correlates such as
mutational load and copy number loss burden needs to be further tested
in a large cohort with pre–PD-1 blockade biopsies available.
Additionally, we observed increased TCR clonality after CTLA-4
blockade treatment in all PD-1 blockade responders with paired pre–
CTLA-4 and pre–PD-1 blockade biopsies available. Previous work
has shown that TCR clonality at the pre–PD-1 time point was not sig-
nificantly different (P = 0.1604) between PD-1 blockade responders
treated with anti–CTLA-4 and PD-1 blockade responders naïve to anti–
CTLA-4 (10). Therefore, CTLA-4 blockade treatment may increase
TCR clonality to a level high enough to mediate response to subsequent
PD-1 blockade in certain patients. This result suggests that responders
to PD-1 blockade may derive clinical benefit from previous CTLA-4
blockade, substantiating the utility of sequential CTLA-4 and PD-
1 blockade. From a clinical perspective, sequential CTLA-4 and
PD-1 blockade treatment might be able to increase the number of pa-
tients with high baseline TCR clonality before PD-1 blockade compared
with PD-1 blockade monotherapy.
What emerges from this and other works regarding immune
checkpoint responder/nonresponder identification is a complex picture
likely involving the interplay of tumor genomic characteristics, tumor
modulation of the local microenvironment, and the extent of immune
surveillance in the tumor milieu at the time of initiation of therapy. Fur-
thermore, several intriguing questions emerge from this and other works.
What is the effect of CTLA-4 blockade on the molecular profile of anti–
PD-1 responders? Do thedata reportedholdtrue whenapplied to CTLA-
4 blockade treatment–naïve patients? To what extent do the data emerging
from melanoma studies apply to other tumor treatment contexts? There
will likely be a need to develop integrated molecular phenotyping
approaches to more accurately delineate responders/nonresponders
and develop tractable predictive models for these promising therapies.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
Serial tumor biopsies were collected from patients with metastatic mel-
anoma treated with CTLA-4 blockade and/or PD-1 blockade through
an expanded access program for MK-3475 at the University of Texas
(UT) MD Anderson Cancer Center. From serial tumor biopsies, we
generated multidimensional profiling data (WES, TCR-seq, and Nano-
String gene expression profiling). Multidimensional profiling data were
analyzed to identify genomic and immune correlates of treatment
response and resistance mechanisms of immune checkpoint blockade.
Patient cohort and tumor samples
A cohort of 56 patients with metastatic melanoma were included in this
study (38). These patients were treated at the UT MD Anderson Cancer
Center between October 2011 and March 2015, and tumor samples
were collected with appropriate written informed consent and analyzed
(IRB LAB00-063, LAB03-0320, 2012-0846, PA13-0291, and PA12-
0305). All tumor measurements were performed by a physician formal-
ly trained in tumor metrics, specifically RECIST 1.1, because it applies to
the cohort. All metrics used computerized axial tomography scan im-
aging of measurable lesions (total of five lesions and maximum of two
per organ) that met measurability based on strict RECIST 1.1 criteria
(>10-mm-long axis per target lesion or >15-mm-short axis for target
lymph nodes). The sums of these respective diameters were compared
to the sum at baseline. According to RECIST 1.1 criteria, a lymph node
with <10-mm-short axis was considered nonpathologic. As such, pa-
tients were first defined as those having either (i) a complete response
[disappearance of all target lesions, reduction in any pathological lymph
nodes (whether target or not) in short axis to <10 mm, and the appear-
ance of no new lesions], (ii) a partial response (at least a 30% decrease in
the sum of diameters of target lesions, no PD in nontarget lesions, and
the appearance of no new lesions), (iii) progressive disease (at least a
20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking the
smallest sum or baseline as reference,witha minimum absolute increase
of 5 mm, and/or the development of any new lesions), or (iii) stable
disease [neither sufficient decrease to designate complete response/
partial response nor increase to qualify as progressive disease (again
using the smallest sum of appropriate diameters as a reference)]. All
image responses were vetted with ≥2 serial images over a ≥6-month
interval between baseline and assignment of response. RECIST 1.1
quantification of response was then used to assign patient designation
as responder (complete response, partial response, or stable disease for
≥6 months) or nonresponder (progressive disease or stable disease with
<6-month duration). All specimens were excisional biopsies or resec-
tion specimens. Tumor samples were assessed by two pathologists for
adequate tumor tissue for WES (table S2).
Sample processing
After fixation and mounting, 5 to 10 slices with 5-mm thickness were
obtained from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor
blocks. Tumor-enriched tissue was macrodissected, and xylene (EMD
Millipore) was used for deparaffinization, followed by two ethanol
washes. Reagents from the Qiagen QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue Kit
(#56404) were used in conjunction with an overnight incubation at
55°C to complete tissue lysis. Next, samples were incubated at 90°C
for 1 hour to reverse formaldehyde modification of nucleic acids. After
isolation by QIAamp MinElute column, variable amounts of buffer
ATE were added to each column to elute the DNA. Germline DNA
was obtained from peripheral blood mononuclear cells.
Whole-exome sequencing
The initial genomic DNA input into the shearing step was 250 ng in
55 ml of low tris-EDTA buffer. Forked Illumina paired-end adapters
with random eight–base pair indexes were used for adapter ligation.
All reagents used for end repair, A-base addition, adapter ligation,
and library enrichment polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were from
the KAPA Hyper Prep Kit (#KK8504). Unligated adapter and/or
adapter-dimer molecules were removed from the libraries before cluster
generation using solid-phase reverse immobilization bead cleanup. The
elution volume after postligation cleanup was 25 ml. Library con-
struction was performed following the manufacturer’s instructions.
Sample concentrations were measured after library construction using
the Agilent Bioanalyzer. Each hybridization reaction contained 650 to

 750 ng of the prepared library in a volume of 3.4 ml. Samples were
lyophilized and reconstituted to bring the final concentration to 221 ng/ml.
After reconstitution, the Agilent SureSelectXT Target Enrichment
(#5190-8646) protocol was followed according to the manufacturer’s
guidelines. The libraries were then normalized to equal concentrations
using an Eppendorf Mastercycler EP Gradient instrument and pooled
to equimolar amounts on the Agilent Bravo B platform. Library pools
were quantified using the KAPA Library Quantification Kit (#KK4824).
On the basis of quantitative PCR quantification, libraries were then
brought to 2 nM and denatured using 0.2 N NaOH. After denaturation,
libraries were diluted to 14 to 20 pM using Illumina hybridization
buffer. Next, cluster amplification was performed on denatured tem-
plates according to the manufacturer’s guidelines (Illumina), HiSeq
v3 cluster chemistry and flow cells, as well as Illumina’s Multiplexing
Sequencing Primer Kit. The pools were then added to flow cells using
the cBot System, sequenced using the HiSeq 2000/2500 v3 sequencing-
by-synthesis method, and then analyzed using RTA v.1.13 or later. Each
pool of whole-exome libraries was subjected to paired 76–base pair
runs. An eight–base pair index-sequencing read was used to meet cov-
erage and to demultiplex the pooled samples. The mean coverage for
exome data was 177× in tumors and 91× in germ line. Mean sequencing
coverage and tumor purities were similar across groups, with the excep-
tion of on-treatment biopsies given the presence of lower tumor content
and enriched immune infiltrates (fig. S2). Therefore, WES data from
on-treatment samples were excluded from downstream analysis.
Mutation calling and ITH analysis
Exome sequencing data were processed using Saturn V, the next-
generation sequencing data processing and analysis pipeline developed
and maintained by the bioinformatics group of the Institute for Applied
Cancer Science and Department of Genomic Medicine at the UT MD
Anderson Cancer Center. BCL files (raw output of Illumina HiSeq)
were processed using Illumina CASAVA (Consensus Assessment of
Sequence and Variation) software (v1.8.2) for demultiplexing/conversion
to FASTQ format. The FASTQ files were then aligned to the hg19
human genome build using BWA (v0.7.5) (54). The aligned BAM
files were subjected to mark duplication, realignment, and recalibra-
tion using the Picard tool and GATK software tools (55–57). The BAM
files were then used for downstream analysis. MuTect (v1.1.4) (58) was
applied to identify somatic point mutations, and Pindel (v0.2.4) (59)
was applied to identify small insertions and deletions. Somatic mu-
tations in HLA genes were called by POLYSOLVER (v1.0) (44).
EXPANDS (v1.6.1) (60) and SciClone (v1.0.7) (61) were applied with
only loss of heterozygosity–free regions to estimate the number of
clones per tumor.
Neoantigen prediction
HLA class I neoepitopes were predicted for each patient as previously
described (62). Briefly, patient HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C variants
were identified using ATHLATES (v2014_04_26) (63). Next, all pos-
sible 9- to 11-mer peptides flanking a nonsynonymous exonic mu-
tation were generated computationally, and binding affinity was
predicted on the basis of patient HLA and compared to that of the
wild-type peptide counterpart using NetMHCpan (v2.8) algorithm
(64). Mutated peptides with predicted IC50 <500 nM were con-
sidered as predicted neoantigens. The Cancer Genome Atlas mela-
noma (40) gene expression data were used to further filter out
predicted neoantigens with mean gene expression values below 5
[mean RSEM <5].
CNA analysis
Sequenza (v2.1.2) (65) was applied to obtain copy number segments of
log2 copy ratios (tumor/normal) for each tumor sample. R package
“CNTools” (v1.24.0) (66) was used to identify copy number gain
(log2 copy ratios > log21.5) or loss (log2 copy ratios < −log21.5) at
the gene level. The burden of copy number gain or loss was then
calculated as the total number of genes with copy number gain or loss
per sample. For recurrent CNA analysis, R package “cghMCR”
(v1.26.0) (67) was applied to log2 copy ratios (tumor/normal) obtained
from “exomecn” (in-house copy number caller). SGOL scores of copy
number segments or genes were calculated as sum of log2 copy ratios of
each copy number segment or gene across all samples within a group of
interest. Copy number segments with both copy number gain and copy
number loss present within a group were excluded. We identified
genomicregionsofrecurrentCNAs[minimumcommonregions(MCRs)]
using cghMCR function with the following parameters: gapAllowed,
500; alteredLow, −log2(1.5); alteredHigh, log2(1.5); recurrence, 60; span-
Limit, 2+e+07; thresholdType, “value” (recurrent copy number loss was
defined as copy number loss observed in more than 60% of samples in a
group of interest). Tumor suppressor genes annotated in recurrent copy
number loss plots were obtained as cancer genes present in both the
COSMIC (v77) (68) and TSGene (69) databases. Four samples were
excluded from analysis because of unusable copy number profiles
(45C, 19D, 45E, and 20E).
TCR-seq and clonality analysis
TCR-seq of the CDR3 variable region of the b chain was performed by
ImmunoSeq hsTCRB Kit as described previously (Adaptive Biotechnol-
ogies) (70, 71). Briefly, DNA was extracted from FFPE tumor tissues,
and CDR3 regions were amplified before sequencing by MiSeq 150×
(Illumina). Data were then transferred to Adaptive Technologies
for deconvolution of CDR3 b sequences. For each sample, Shannon
entropy and TCR clonality were calculated using the ImmunoSeq
Analyzer (10).
NanoString gene expression profiling
NanoString was performed using a custom codeset of 795 genes as pre-
viously described (38). Briefly, RNA was extracted using the RNeasy
Mini Kit (Qiagen) from FFPE blocks, after initial confirmation of tumor
presence and content by two pathologists using hematoxylin and eosin.
For gene expression studies, 1 mg of RNA was used per sample. Hybrid-
ization was performed for 16 to 18 hours at 65°C, and samples were
loaded onto the nCounter Prep Station for binding and washing before
scanning and capture of 600 fields using the nCounter. Preprocessing of
NanoString data was performed as previously described (38). Immune
scores were calculated as geometric mean of gene expression of cytolytic
markers (GZMA, GZMB, PRF1, and GNLY), HLA molecules (HLA-A,
HLA-B, HLA-C, HLA-E, HLA-F, HLA-G, HLA-H, HLA-DMA, HLA-
DMB, HLA-DOA, HLA-DOB, HLA-DPA1, HLA-DPB1, HLA-DQA1,
HLA-DQA2, HLA-DQB1, HLA-DRA, and HLA-DRB1), IFN-g pathway
genes (IFNG, IFNGR1, IFNGR2, IRF1, STAT1, and PSMB9), chemo-
kines (CCR5, CCL3, CCL4, CCL5, CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11),
and adhesion molecules (ICAM1, ICAM2, ICAM3, ICAM4, ICAM5,
and VCAM1).
Independent (Van Allen) cohort analysis
Mutational load was obtained from nonsynonymous mutational load in
a previous study (7). WES data (SAM files) from 110 melanoma patients
and RNA-seq data from 42 patients (FASTQ files) were downloaded

 through the dbGaP (accession number phs000452.v2.p1). CNAs were
identified from the same computational pipeline as described above.
For the Van Allen cohort, recurrent copy number loss was defined as
copy number loss observed in more than 40% of samples in a group of
interest. Twelve sampleswere excludedfrom analysisbecause of unusable
copy number profiles (Pat06, Pat73, Pat78, Pat81, Pat92, Pat106, Pat121,
Pat132,Pat165,Pat166,Pat171,andPat175).Intheminimalornoclinical
benefit group, samples with low burden of copy number loss (<100) were
excluded from recurrent CNA analysis. The relatively low cutoff of 100
was chosen to capture most of the recurrent events. For RNA-seq anal-
ysis, all the RNA-seq samples were first aligned to the human reference
genome (hg19 and GRCh37.75) with Bowtie2 (v2.2.5). RSEM (v1.2.12)
was used to quantify transcript expression at the gene level in fragments
per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads (FPKM). Immune
scores for the independent cohort were calculated by ESTIMATE
(48). eBayes-moderated t test was performed to compare the high bur-
den of copy number loss (n = 10) and low burden of copy number loss
(n = 10) groups. Rank metric was then calculated as the sign of log2
fold changes multiplied by inverse of P values. GSEA (49) was per-
formed on the rank metric–sorted list of genes (table S17A).
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using R 3.2.2. Statistical tests in-
cluded two-sided Fisher’s exact tests and two-sided Mann-Whitney
U tests.
