Abstract
Modeling clinically relevant tissue responses using cell models poses a significant chal-
lenge for drug development, in particular for drug induced liver injury (DILI). This is mainly
because existing liver models lack longevity and tissue-level complexity which limits their
utility in predictive toxicology. In this study, we established and characterized novel bio-
printed human liver tissue mimetics comprised of patient-derived hepatocytes and non-
parenchymal cells in a defined architecture. Scaffold-free assembly of different cell types in
an in vivo-relevant architecture allowed for histologic analysis that revealed distinct intercel-
lular hepatocyte junctions, CD31+ endothelial networks, and desmin positive, smooth mus-
cle actin negative quiescent stellates. Unlike what was seen in 2D hepatocyte cultures, the
tissues maintained levels of ATP, Albumin as well as expression and drug-induced enzyme
activity of Cytochrome P450s over 4 weeks in culture. To assess the ability of the 3D liver
cultures to model tissue-level DILI, dose responses of Trovafloxacin, a drug whose hepato-
toxic potential could not be assessed by standard pre-clinical models, were compared to
the structurally related non-toxic drug Levofloxacin. Trovafloxacin induced significant, dose-
dependent toxicity at clinically relevant doses (� 4uM). Interestingly, Trovafloxacin toxicity
was observed without lipopolysaccharide stimulation and in the absence of resident macro-
phages in contrast to earlier reports. Together, these results demonstrate that 3D bioprinted
liver tissues can both effectively model DILI and distinguish between highly related com-
pounds with differential profile. Thus, the combination of patient-derived primary cells with
bioprinting technology here for the first time demonstrates superior performance in terms of
mimicking human drug response in a known target organ at the tissue level.
Introduction
Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is the leading cause of acute liver failure and post-market
drug withdrawals. While the exact root cause of DILI often remains elusive and is usually

Competing Interests: The authors have read the
journal's policy and the authors of this manuscript
have the following competing interests: ABR, JF, and
 multi-factorial, a common aspect is the interplay and cross-talk between the various cell types
present within the liver [1–8]. For pre-clinical safety assessment of novel drug candidates, ani-
mal tests have typically been used and are still required as part of the data package provided to
regulatory authorities. However, it is widely recognized that data generated in rodents trans-
late only to a limited extent to humans and the relevance of such tests is being questioned—
apart from the additional ethical aspects around animal use [9]. Significant efforts and
resources therefore are expended during drug development to not only model the human liver
accurately with respect to metabolism but also to predict and understand the mechanisms of
DILI. Primary human hepatocytes are widely used as pre-clinical models of human liver to
predict drug disposition endpoints and toxicity. However, the rapid loss of hepatocyte func-
tion ex vivo in traditional monolayer culture systems limits their application to short term
acute effects [10, 11]. Over the last decade, researchers have demonstrated clear benefits from
culture conditions that encourage three-dimensional growth, with hepatocytes displaying
increased viability and functional capability when grown in sandwich cultures [12] or self-
assembled spheroids [13]. Indeed, some functions of metabolism are transiently stabilized in
these culture systems, including drug metabolism, transport, and CYP induction. In some
cases, non-parenchymal cells (e.g. stellate, endothelial and immune cells) have also been
added to the 2D or spheroid cultures. The resulting co-culture systems have demonstrated
some enhanced functionality when compared to primary hepatocyte monolayer or sandwich
cultures, including enhancement of hepatocyte viability and the ability to investigate the con-
tribution of inflammatory mechanisms to toxicity [10, 11, 14, 15]. Beyond the impact of the
multi-cellular context, spatial patterning has been shown to be critical both in normal liver
physiologic function and in the pathophysiology of liver disease [16]. Hepatocytes that are
located in the portal region naturally experience higher levels of nutrients and altered oxygen
tension that result in spatially defined metabolic enzyme expression. As a consequence, toxic
metabolites are produced and mediate tissue damage in distinct regions of the lobule, as has
been demonstrated histologically in acute acetaminophen toxicity [17]. With this in mind,
phenotypes that are a consequence of specific spatial patterns, such as cellular polarity and
metabolite production, may suffer from issues of reproducibility in self-assembled in vitro sys-
tems. Recent advances in microfabrication techniques allow for controlled cell patterning,
leading to defined heterotypic cell contacts and subsequent enhancement of hepatocyte func-
tionality [18, 19]. Until recently, fabrication methods that enabled controlled spatial pattern-
ing of two or more cell types were limited to two-dimensional cultures or cultures that were a
few cell layers thick [18]. While those techniques allow preservation of oxygen and nutrient
diffusion, they also result in a higher proportion of contact with a solid surface versus cell-cell
contact, which may accelerate loss of function in specialized cell types such as hepatocytes,
and may result in aberrant responses to stimuli [20]. 3D bioprinting affords a means of fabri-
cating tissue that is both spatially patterned and sufficiently three-dimensional (i.e., typically
200 microns or greater in the smallest dimension) such that it can be assessed histologically as
well as biochemically [21, 22]. Histological examination remains a significant mode of diagno-
sis in the assessment of toxic outcomes in vivo, especially those in which physiologically-rele-
vant doses are applied over extended periods of time and mechanism(s) of toxicity involve
more than simple direct cytotoxicity to hepatocytes. Changes in relevant biomarkers in these
cases are often not evident until well after the disease has been established, making it difficult
to intervene early enough to halt progression [23, 24]. A fully human in vitro system compris-
ing multiple liver cell types in a defined spatial architecture that can be used to gather both
histopathological and biochemical data therefore has the potential to provide important
insights about the human tissue response in the pre-clinical setting, before costly human trials
are initiated.

and materials.
 To address these issues, bioprinted 3D human liver tissues composed of primary human
parenchymal (hepatocyte) and non-parenchymal (endothelial and hepatic stellate) cell popula-
tions were evaluated for their potential use as durable, multi-cellular models of human liver tis-
sue. Basic histologic, biochemical, and metabolic characterization of the 3D liver tissues was
performed. In addition, to investigate the ability of the tissues to be used as a model of DILI, we
tested their response to the known hepatotoxicant Trovafloxicin compared to its non-toxic rel-
ative Levofloxacin. Taken together, our results suggest that the 3D liver tissues could be a valu-
able addition to the pre-clinical toxicity pipeline.
Materials and Methods
Bioprinted 3D Liver tissues
3D Liver tissues comprised of cryopreserved primary human hepatocytes (Life Technologies,
Carlsbad, CA, USA), hepatic stellates (ScienCell; Carlsbad, CA, USA), and HUVEC cells (Bec-
ton Dickinson; Tewksbury, MA, USA) were manufactured by Organovo (San Diego, CA, USA)
using published patented protocols [25–28]. Briefly, stellate and HUVEC cells were propagated
per the manufacturer’s instructions prior to tissue fabrication. Cryopreserved hepatocytes were
thawed and prepared for use per the manufacturer’s instructions. Each commercial cell sup-
plier provides assurances that the cells come from tissues collected in compliance with applica-
ble laws and provided based on informed consent by the donors. Separate high density bio-
inks comprising parenchymal cells (100% cellular paste, generated via compaction) or non-
parenchymal cells (150e6 cells /mL formulated in NovoGel1 2.0 Hydrogel; [29]) were prepared
and loaded into separate heads of the NovoGen Bioprinter1 Instrument[21, 25–28] within a
standard biosafety cabinet. A computer script was then executed to deposit the bioinks in a
two-compartment planar geometry onto the membranes of standard 24-well 0.4 μm transwell
culture inserts (Corning, Tewksbury, MA USA) via continuous deposition microextrusion (for
in depth technology review, see [30]) with the non-parenchymal cells comprising the border
regions of each compartment and the parenchymal cells filling each compartment. Following
fabrication, the tissues were fed daily with 600 μL of 3D Liver Tissue Media, consisting of
DMEM supplemented with Primary Hepatocyte Maintenance Supplements (Life Technolo-
gies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and EGM-2 (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland),and incubated at 37°C under
humidified atmospheric conditions supplemented with 5% CO2. Tissues were allowed to
mature in culture for at least three days following fabrication prior to initiation of experimenta-
tion, and were substantially free of pre-formed scaffold at the time of use. For the one month
timecourse, tissues were fed daily for a total of 28 days post-fabrication. For the CYP3A4
metabolism and compound toxicity studies, tissues were fed daily with or without treatments
as described below.
CYP3A4 Metabolism Assessment
To assess the expression and function of CYP3A4, bioprinted tissues were exposed to 10 μM
Rifampicin (Rif; catalog# R3501-250MG, Sigma Chemical Company, St. Louis, MO, USA) or
vehicle (0.1% DMSO) in 3D Liver Tissue Media, n = 6 per group, daily for 3 days as depicted
on the experimental timeline below (Fig 1). Following 3 days of treatment with Rifampicin,
spent media samples were collected and stored at -80°C as negative controls for metabolite for-
mation, while 3 tissues treated with Rifampicin and 3 tissues treated with vehicle were homoge-
nized in Trizol and stored at -80°C for later use in mRNA quantitation as described below. The
remaining tissues (n = 3 with Rif, n = 3 with vehicle) were then exposed to Midazolam (Mid;
catalog# M-908, Cerilliant Corporation). At 24 hours after treatment, the spent media samples
were collected and frozen -80°C while the tissues were homogenized in PBS (without Mg and

 Ca), snap frozen on dry ice and stored -80°C. The frozen spent media and homogenized tissues
in PBS were then analyzed for levels of 4-hydroxymidazolam using mass spec analysis done at
SciAnalytical Strategies Inc. (La Jolla, CA, USA). Data shown is the average of 3 replicates plus
or minus standard deviation.
mRNA quantitation
Bulk RNA was extracted from 3D liver tissues at the time points indicated using Trizol (Life
Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and Direct-zol RNA miniprep kit (Zymo, Irvine, CA, USA)
per manufacturer’s instructions with the addition of tissue disruption using the Tissue Lyser
(Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). RNA was quantified using the Nanodrop Lite (Thermo Scien-
tific, Wilmington, Delaware USA). RT-PCR was carried out directly with RNA treated with
DNase (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). All RT-PCR amplification reactions were carried out
using the StepOnePlus real-time PCR system (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) utilizing
Fast 1-Step mix (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and the following FAM-labeled Taq-
man gene expression assays (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA): Hs00167927_m1 for
CYP1A2, Hs02383631_s1 for CYP2C9, Hs00604506_m1 for CYP3A4, Hs03044634_m1 for
CYP2B6, and Hs02576167_m1 for CYP2D6. VIC-labeled GAPDH endogenous control
4326317E was also amplified in the same well of each reaction for normalization. Fast RT-PCR
reactions were conducted with the following conditions: reverse transcription at 50°C for 5
minutes; RT inactivation/denaturation at 95°C for 20 seconds; and 45 cycles of amplification at
95°C for 3 seconds followed by 60°C for 30 seconds. Data was expressed as delta Ct relative to
GAPDH and converted to relative quantity (RQ) by the calculation RQ = [2^(- delta Ct)]�
10,000. Data shown are the average of duplicate qPCR wells from 3 tissues per group plus or
minus standard deviation and was graphed in Prism Software (Graphpad, La Jolla, CA, USA).
Compound toxicity assays
For assessment of compound toxicity, Trovafloxacin mesylate (catalog# PZ0015-25mg; lot#
020M4708V) and Levofloxacin (catalog# 28266-10-F; lot# BCBF7004V) were purchased from
Sigma Chemical Company (St. Louis, MO, USA). Stock compounds were serially diluted five-
fold in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and then 5μl of stock compounds were diluted into 5ml of
tissue 3D Liver Tissue Media™ to produce the working concentrations described at the same
final concentration of DMSO at 0.1%. 5μl of DMSO was diluted into 5ml of 3D Liver Tissue
Media™ to generate the vehicle control. Starting on day 3 of culture, bioprinted tissues were
exposed to various concentrations of Trovafloxacin, Levofloxacin, vehicle, or media alone daily
for 7 days as depicted on the experimental timeline below (Fig 2). Supernatants were collected

 daily and analyzed fresh for LDH activity. At 24 hours after the final dose, supernatants were
collected and frozen at -80 for albumin analysis, while tissues were either lysed and analyzed
for ATP content or fixed and embedded for histological characterization. Details of superna-
tant and tissue analyses are described below.
Histological analysis using paraffin sections
At the timepoints described for each study, liver tissues were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde
solution (2% paraformaldehyde, 10mM calcium chloride, 50 mM sucrose in PBS) for 24 hours
at room temperature. After 24 hours, the fixation solution was removed and replaced with 70%
ethanol. Constructs with the attached transwell membrane were submerged in 45°C liquid His-
togel (American MasterTech Scientific, Lodi, CA, USA) in a plastic biopsy mold and allowed to
solidify at room temperature. Histogel blocks with embedded liver constructs were then pro-
cessed for paraffin embedding using a tissue processor. Following infiltration with paraffin,
liver constructs were embedded in paraffin molds and 5 μm cross-sections were prepared with
a rotary microtome (Jung Biocut 2035; Leica Microsystems, Buffalo Grove, IL, USA). For
hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, slides were dewaxed in xylene and rehydrated through
100%, 95%, 70%, and 50% ethanol and rinsed in distilled water. Slides were immersed in Gill’s
hematoxylin (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA, USA). Following rinsing with distilled water,
slides were briefly immersed in 0.2% v/v ammonium hydroxide. After rinsing with distilled
water, slides were immersed in aqueous eosin solution (American MasterTech Scientific, Lodi,
CA, USA). For Masson’s Trichrome staining, slides were deparaffinized and stained according
to the manufacturer’s protocol (American MasterTech Scientific). Slides were then dehydrated
through an ethanol gradient, cleared in xylene, and mounted with resinous mounting media
(CytoSeal; Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA, USA).
For immunohistochemical analyses, slides were de-waxed in xylene and rehydrated through
graded ethanols before finally washing in distilled water. Rehydrated sections were subjected to
heat-mediated antigen retrieval in 10 mM sodium citrate pH 6.0 using a standard microwave
oven to heat the solution and slides to a 95°C followed by slow cooling for 30 minutes. Slides
were then blocked with 10% goat serum in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) for 1 hour, followed by
incubation with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C. The following primary antibodies were
utilized: rabbit anti-E-cadherin (1:50 dilution; Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA); mouse anti-
albumin (1:200 dilution; Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA); rabbit anti-desmin (1:200 dilution;
Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA); mouse anti-CD31 (1:25 dilution; Abcam, Cambridge, MA,
USA); rabbit anti-CD31 (1:250 dilution; Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA); mouse-anti-smooth
muscle actin (α-SMA, 1:200; Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA); mouse anti—proliferating cell
nuclear antigen (1:10,000 dilution; Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA); rabbit anti-proliferating
cell nuclear antigen (1:2000 dilution; Cell Signaling Technologies, Danvers, MA, USA). Sec-
tions were then washed three times in TBS with 0.1% Tween 20 and incubated with AlexaFluor
488 or AlexaFluor 568-conjugated secondary antibodies (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA,

 USA) diluted 1:200 in TBS. For α-SMA detection, fluorescence was applied using Tyramide
signal amplification (TSA) Kit with HRP-streptavidin and Alexa Fluor 594 substrate (Thermo-
Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA), for 1 minute each. Sections were then washed three times in
TBS-0.1% Tween 20, rinsed with distilled water, and mounted with DAPI-containing mount-
ing media (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA, USA). Immunohistochemistry for vimentin was per-
formed on the Ventana Discovery XT1 immunostainer (Ventana, Tucson, AZ, USA) with an
anti-vimentin mouse monoclonal antibody (1:10 dilution; Ventana, Tucson, AZ, USA, 790–
2917) as primary antibody and biotin-SP-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (1:100 dilution;
Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA, USA, 715-065-151) in a standard protocol using
the Ventana DAB Map1 kit (Ventana, Tucson, AZ, USA, 05266360001). Slides were counter-
stained with hematoxylin.
Histological analysis using frozen sections
At the timepoints described for each study, liver constructs were rinsed once with DPBS,
immersed in Tissue-Tek OCT compound (Sakura Finetek Europe B.V., The Netherlands), and
flash frozen. Frozen blocks containing the liver construct were then sectioned at 5 μm on a
cryostat (Leica Cryocut 1800, Leica Microsystems, Buffalo Grove, IL, USA). Sectioned slides
were snap fixed in -20°C liquid acetone and allowed to air dry for 20 minutes at room tempera-
ture. For Oil Red O staining, slides were rehydrated in distilled water and immersed in 60% iso-
propanol for 2 min. Slides were stained with 0.3% w/v Oil Red O (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA)
in 60% isopropanol for 15 minutes at room temperature, followed by rinsing with 60% isopro-
panol for 1 minute. Slides were immersed briefly in Gill’s hematoxylin to counterstain. Slides
were rinsed with distilled water and mounted with aqueous media (American MasterTech Sci-
entific, Lodi, CA, USA).
Image acquisition
H&E, PAS, and Oil Red O-stained slides were imaged using a Zeiss Axioskop microscope
(Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Images were acquired with an Insight 2 camera and Spot 5.0 software
(Diagnostic Instruments, Inc., Sterling Heights, MI, USA). Fluorescently labeled slides were
imaged with a Zeiss AxioImager microscope and images were acquired with a Zeiss ICM-1
camera and Zeiss Zen Pro software.
Immunoassays
Supernatants frozen at the indicated study timepoints were thawed on ice and analyzed by
ELISA for albumin (Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, TX, USA), per the manufacturer’s
instructions on a microplate reader (BMG Labtech, Germany) with minor modifications.
Briefly, a half-area 96-well plate was employed, and the volumes of the kit reagents were
reduced by 50%. For the one month tissue timecourse, data shown is the average of 5 tissue
replicates plus or minus standard deviation. In the case of the toxicity studies with Trovafloxa-
cin and Levofloxacin, data shown is the average of 10 tissue replicates across two independent
experiments plus or minus standard deviation.
LDH assays
Supernatants for LDH were collected at the indicated timepoints for each study and analyzed
fresh for LDH activity colorimetrically with a commercially available reagent (Abcam, Cam-
bridge, MA, USA) per the manufacturer’s instructions with minor modifications. Briefly, a
half-area 96-well plate was employed, allowing the volumes of the kit reagents to be reduced by

 50%, and samples were diluted to obtain readings in the linear range of the standard curve.
Data shown is the average of 10 tissue replicates across two independent experiments plus or
minus standard deviation.
Tissue viability assays
At the timepoints described for each study, tissues were lysed and analyzed for ATP content
using Cell Titer Glo (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Tissues were shaken in the presence of
Cell Titer Glo reagent for 2 min then the mixture was transferred to 1.5mL Eppendorf tubes
and triturated to further break up the tissues. Samples were allowed to equilibrate for 10 min-
utes at room temperature. Samples were centrifuged at 1000 g for 2 minutes and aliquots of
supernatant were transferred to a white opaque 96 well plate for luminescence measurement
on a microplate reader (BMG Labtech, Germany). For the one month tissue timecourse, data
shown is the average of 3 replicates plus or minus standard deviation. In the case of the toxicity
studies with Trovafloxacin and Levofloxacin, data shown is the average of 6 tissue replicates
across two independent experiments plus or minus standard deviation.
2D Hepatocyte Cultures
Cryopreserved human hepatocytes were thawed according to manufacturer protocol and
seeded on collagen I coated 24 well plates (Becton Dickenson; Tewksbury, MA, USA) at a
density of 4.23e5 cells per well in primary hepatocyte plating media (Life Technologies,
Carlsbad, CA, USA). Hepatocytes were incubated at 37°C with 5% CO2 to enable attachment
for 4 hours. Following the attachment incubation period the plating media was aspirated
from the wells and cells were fed with hepatocyte maintenance media (Life Technologies,
Carlsbad, CA, USA). Cells were incubated in maintenance media for the time period indi-
cated, with daily media exchange. To assess Trovafloxacin toxicity in 2D hepatocyte cultures,
media containing vehicle control or Trovafloxacin was prepared as described above for 3D
tissue compound toxicity studies and dosed daily for 7 days prior to assessment of cell viabil-
ity and albumin production. Viability assays (Cell Titer Glo; Promega, Madison, WI, USA)
and albumin ELISA (Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, TX, USA) were performed as
described above.
Results and Discussion
Histological characterization of 3D liver tissues
3D liver tissues composed of human hepatic stellate cells (HSC), human umbilical vein endo-
thelial cells (HUVEC), and cryopreserved primary human hepatocytes were fabricated directly
into 24-well Transwell1 plates (Fig 3A). Histologic analyses conducted throughout the
maturation and maintenance period show that the bioprinted tissues retained the compart-
mentalization of parenchymal and non-parenchymal components established at the time of
fabrication, and that the tissues condense and remodel over time, yielding stable 3D structures
with a minimal thickness of 250 μm in the Z axis, dense tissue-like cellularity, and no evidence
of necrosis (Fig 3B). Masson’s trichrome staining of the 3D bioprinted liver tissues revealed
defined areas of collagen deposition in the non-parenchymal regions of the tissues, consistent
with published evidence that functional endothelial cells produce and secrete extracellular
matrix (ECM) during vasculogenesis [31] (Fig 3C). This ECM allows for the formation of a
cohesive tissue unit without the use of exogenous scaffolding materials. Immunofluorescent
analyses of the tissues showed robust surface expression of the intercellular junctional
protein E-cadherin as well as cytoplasm-localized human albumin in the hepatocytes of the

 parenchymal compartment (Fig 3D). Over time in culture, the endothelial cells form extensive
networks, with evidence of lumens by day 21 (Fig 3E). While human and rodent HSCs main-
tained in standard monolayer culture on plastic undergo activation to a myofibroblast pheno-
type with concomitant upregulation of smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), the HSC resident in the
interior of the 3D liver tissues express desmin and not α-SMA (Fig 3E and 3F), suggesting that
they are capable of establishing and maintaining a quiescent state within the 3D multicellular
environment [32, 33]. A subpopulation of activated stellate cells, identified by their expression
of α-SMA, can be identified at the tissue/media interface (Fig 3F). Lipid storage and glycogen
storage, two functions associated with hepatocytes in vivo, were also demonstrated in the bio-
printed liver tissues after maturation (Fig 3G and 3H). Comparison of vimentin staining
between bioprinted liver tissues and native human liver biopsy shows similar patterns of
expression (Fig 4).
Biochemical characterization of 3D liver tissues
To assess their general health, levels of ATP were measured in 3D liver tissues over 4 weeks.
For the first two weeks in culture, ATP levels remained fairly consistent, with a statistically sig-
nificant increase seen by Day 21 (Fig 5A). This increase could reflect enhanced metabolic
capacity of the tissues, or continued proliferation of the non-parenchymal tissue components;
ongoing proliferation of a subset of both cell types comprising the non-parenchymal compart-
ment was verified by immunohistochemistry for proliferative cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), a
marker of proliferating cells (S1 Fig). As an additional assessment of tissue viability, levels of
secreted albumin were measured throughout the 4 week timecourse. Albumin, a marker of
mature hepatocytes and general indicator of protein production capacity, was produced from
the first day of fabrication and increased steadily until Day 14 (Fig 5B), reaching a plateau that
was then maintained throughout the rest of the culture period. As suggested by the literature,
this sustained pattern of albumin and ATP production is in sharp contrast to hepatocytes in
standard 2D culture, which show precipitous declines in both ATP and albumin after two
weeks and negligible levels of albumin by week 4 (Fig 5C).

 Cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) are responsible for the first pass metabolism of xenobi-
otics, introducing small chemical changes that facilitate compound excretion. Temporal analy-
sis of a CYP mRNA expression in the 3D liver tissues showed sustained basal expression of key
CYP enzymes through 28 days in culture (Fig 6A). Interestingly, while levels of all enzymes
increased during the first week of culture, expression of CYP3A4 and 1A2 did not reach a pla-
teau until Day 14. This is in contrast to what has been seen with isolated primary hepatocytes,
where they lose expression of this class of enzymes within two weeks in culture [11]. To verify
enzymatic activity, the ability of tissues to metabolize the CYP3A4 substrate midazolam to
4-hydroxymidazolam was investigated. The 3D liver tissues were able to produce hydroxymi-
dazolam throughout the 4 week culture period (Fig 6B). In addition, higher levels of metabo-
lism were seen when CYP3A4 expression was further induced by exposure to Rifampicin, a
well-known inducer of CYP enzyme expression [34]. The enhanced metabolic activity was
accompanied by an expected increase in CYP3A4 mRNA (Fig 6C). Together, these results con-
firm the sustained viability and functionality of 3D liver tissues over time as well as their clear
superiority over standard 2D culture.

 Trovafloxacin toxicity in 3D Liver Tissues
Trovafloxacin is a third generation anti-infective, which received an adverse drug reaction
(ADR) black box label and was subsequently withdrawn from the market one year following its
approval due to liver failure and death in a small proportion of patients [35]. Interestingly, its
hepatotoxic potential was not identified in pre-clinical models [36]. While the mechanism is
not completely understood, Trovafloxacin toxicity is thought to have an inflammatory compo-
nent [37]. This is largely based on data obtained in rodents after the drug was removed from
the market, where induction of inflammation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) enabled detection
of toxicity following subsequent Trovafloxacin treatment [38]. The inflammatory component
has been postulated to be mediated by Kupffer cells, the resident macrophages in the liver.
However, multiple other non-parenchymal cell types can also produce inflammatory cytokines,
including endothelial cells and hepatic stellates. Therefore, we investigated whether we could
detect toxicity following treatement of 3D liver tissues withTrovafloxacin at doses previously
shown not to induce toxicity in standard 2D culture [14], and compared these effects to the
related non-toxic compound Levofloxacin. Following 7 days of dosing, Trovafloxacin induced
significant decreases in both albumin (Fig 7A) and ATP (Fig 7B). The effects on albumin were
more pronounced, with inhibition greater than 50% even at sub-micromolar doses. Levofloxa-
cin led to a decrease in albumin only at the top dose tested (100 μM), and showed no effect on
overall tissue ATP levels. In contrast, parallel 2D hepatocyte monocultures exposed to the
same treatment conditions and timecourse only showed effects of Trovafloxacin toxicity at the
highest dose tested (100 μM) regardless of the endpoint investigated (Fig 7C and 7D), further
supporting the superiority of 3D liver tissues in predicting clinical hepatotoxicity. Considering
that the levels of ATP and Albumin remain stable in the 2D hepatocyte cultures at Day 7
(Fig 5C and 5D), the lack of sensitivity of the 2D hepatocytes is likely not a consequence of
decreased primary hepatocyte viability. Because the 3D liver tissues can be assessed histologi-
cally, we investigated the impacts of high dose Trovafloxacin versus vehicle on 3D liver tissues
by histology. When compared to vehicle control, high dose Trovafloxacin decreased overall tis-
sue cohesion and increased hepatocyte necrosis, leading to fragmentation (Fig 8). Notably,

 these effects were seen without any added inflammatory stimulus and in the absence of Kupffer
cells.
Discussion
Conventional cell culture models lack the complexity of native tissue and thus have a limited
capacity for predicting tissue-level responses. The rapid loss of function in isolated human
hepatocytes and species differences are major limitations in predictive toxicology which can
lead to unexpected adverse outcomes in the clinic [10, 11]. We have developed a compartmen-
talized 3D human liver model, comprised of both parenchymal (hepatocyte) and non-paren-
chymal (HUVEC and HSC) cells. While they are not native to the liver, HUVEC cells provide a

 readily available, easily expandable source of endothelial cells; liver endothelial cells are a very
specialized cell source that are difficult to obtain and expand. Fabrication of the liver tissues
was enabled by additive manufacturing, which allowed the cellular inputs, spatial distribution,
and geometry to be defined with high precision in the absence of exogenous scaffolds that can
sometimes interfere with intercellular communication and alter the physiologic response to
injury [22, 39]. Because the cells within the 3D structure are in close proximity to each other
immediately after fabrication, they rapidly form tight junctions and deposit their own extracel-
lular matrix, yielding solid microtissues that resemble native liver in relative cellular density.
As highlighted by immunohistochemistry, tight junctions form between the hepatocytes,
endothelial cells within the non-parenchymal zones migrate and organize, forming networks
throughout the tissues, and the hepatic stellate cells localized to the tissue interior maintain
a quiescent desmin positive, α-SMA negative state. While they are not native to the liver,
HUVEC cells provide a readily available, easily expandable source of endothelial cells capable
of forming microvasculature. Both glycogen storage and the accumulation of lipids were nota-
ble within the fields of hepatocytes in the 3D tissues, creating the potential to employ the tis-
sues in chronic experiments that examine perturbations in these storage pathways over time.
The overall tissue structure does not fully recapitulate the native liver lobule, however the pres-
ence and organization of multiple cell types within the compartmentalized structure of the 3D
liver tissues likely play a significant role in preserving liver-specific functions, including stable
levels of albumin and retention of basal and inducible expression and function of key CYP450
enzymes over 4 weeks. The general health of the tissues is further supported by the continued
production of ATP over time. Comparisons to 2D co-cultures comprising all of the cell types
included in the tissues are complicated by the rapid activation and hyperproliferation of HSC
in 2D culture [40]. However, analysis of these same functions in “gold standard” hepatocyte
2D monocultures of the same donor hepatocytes demonstrates the clear enhanced longevity of
these 3D liver tissues. While further characterization is needed, these observations support the

 use of 3D liver tissues to model the pathophysiologic effects of chronic dosing or conditions
that develop over extended periods of time (i.e. steatosis, cholestasis, fibrosis, and infectious
diseases such as hepatitis).
To determine the ability of the 3D liver tissues to model DILI, we investigated the effects
of Trovafloxacin, a well-known inducer of hepatotoxicity which was withdrawn from the
market due to induction of acute liver failure in a small proportion of patients [35, 41]. Tro-
vafloxacin does not show strong toxicity signatures at clinically relevant doses in common in
vitro systems, and toxicity is only seen in rodent models if an inflammatory stimulant like
LPS is co-administered [37, 42]. These findings have led researchers to conclude that the liver
effects of Trovafloxacin may be dependent on underlying inflammation mediated by Kupffer
cells, the resident myeloid cell type in the liver. Interestingly, we saw marked toxicity in the
3D liver system without any exposure to LPS, and in the absence of Kupffer cells. These
effects were seen at clinically relevant doses [14], were more evident in 3D tissues versus par-
allel 2D hepatocyte monocultures, and were detected both biochemically and histologically.
While Kupffer cells can be isolated from human liver, they represent only a fraction of the
liver mass and unlike stellate cells, they do not expand in culture. This makes it difficult to
source enough cells from the same donor to perform multiple replicate studies. Different
donor lot of Kupffer cells have been shown to provide a variable response to stimulation,
which can lead to inconsistent results[43]. The ability to model the effects of compounds
with an inflammatory component like Trovafloxacin without the need for Kupffer cells could
provide a solution to these challenges. In addition, this data may suggest that other non-
parenchymal cell types, such as endothelial cells or stellates, may be playing more of a role in
Trovafloxacin toxicity than previously appreciated. By performing studies in 3D liver tissues
with different cellular composition, mechanisms of hepatotoxins like Trovafloxacin could be
more effectively prosecuted.
In summary, we have shown that this unique 3D model comprising multiple relevant liver
cell types allows for the study of the tissue response to insult beyond simple cytotoxicity,
enabling the measurement of cell type specific responses as well as in vitro histological assess-
ment over extended time in culture. The benefits demonstrated in the 3D human liver tissues
could be a result of the inclusion of the non-parenchymal cells, the 3D tissue context, and the
compartmentalized architecture, or a combination of these features. Follow-up studies that
attempt to dissect the contribution of each of these features will help us understand whether
any one feature alone or in combination drives the enhanced capability of the model. In addi-
tion, a controlled system such as this where specific cell types can be added in or removed on
demand may allow the specific contribution of each individual cell type to be defined for a
given physiologic outcome. Future efforts will be focused on inclusion of some of these addi-
tional specialized liver cells (ex: Kupffer cells, sinusoidal endothelial cells, bile duct epithelium)
in the 3D liver tissues, looking at their impact on both basic functionality and xenobiotic
response.
