Summary
Identification of specific neurophysiological dysfunctions resulting in selective reading difficulty 
(dyslexia) has remained elusive. In addition to impaired reading development, individuals with 
dyslexia frequently exhibit behavioral deficits in perceptual adaptation. Here, we assessed 
neurophysiological adaptation to stimulus repetition in adults and children with dyslexia for a 
wide variety of stimuli – spoken words, written words, visual objects, and faces. For every 
stimulus type, individuals with dyslexia exhibited significantly diminished neural adaptation 
compared to controls in stimulus-specific cortical areas. Better reading skills in adults and children 
with dyslexia were associated with greater repetition-induced neural adaptation. These results 
highlight a dysfunction of rapid neural adaptation as a core neurophysiological difference in 
dyslexia that may underlie impaired reading development. Reduced neurophysiological adaptation 
may relate to prior reports of reduced behavioral adaptation in dyslexia, and may reveal a 
difference in brain functions that ultimately results in a specific reading impairment.

 Dysfunctional adaptation in representing consistent features of stimuli may be a core neural 
signature of dyslexia.
INTRODUCTION
Dyslexia is a neurological disorder that specifically impairs the development of expert 
reading skills (Gabrieli, 2009; Lyon et al., 2003). However, because reading is a relatively 
recent cultural invention rather than an adaptation honed by natural selection, any 
impairment in reading development must arise from some other, more fundamental 
difference in the structure or function of the dyslexic brain. Research in functional brain 
imaging has elaborated a core system of visual and language areas that underlie reading 
(Price, 2012; Rueckl et al., 2015; Schlaggar and McCandliss, 2007; Wandell et al., 2012), 
and shown that this reading network is altered in individuals with dyslexia (Norton et al., 
2015; Paulesu et al. 2014; Pollack et al., 2015; Shaywitz et al. 1998), but so far has produced 
scant evidence for how basic neurobiological processes may be disrupted in individuals with 
dyslexia in a way that explains how the cognitive or perceptual precursors to reading are 
impaired. Behavioral research has not gone much further: although impaired reading 
development is most commonly associated with disordered phonological processing 
(Bradley and Bryant, 1983), this leaves open the question of how such processing itself came 
to be impaired.
Learning to read is a complex process, involving many aspects of vision, language, motor 
control (eye movements), and attention. It is unlikely, therefore, that there is a single 
mechanistic explanation for dyslexia. Nevertheless, there is a large body of evidence that, on 
average, individuals with dyslexia show deficits in rapid perceptual and motor learning on 
nonverbal tasks. Unlike typical readers, who demonstrate enhanced perceptual thresholds in 
discrimination tasks when a target stimulus is held constant throughout an experiment 
(Braida et al., 1984), such perceptual enhancements are frequently reduced or absent in 
dyslexia (Ahissar et al., 2006). This failure to “anchor” to perceptual consistency in dyslexia 
has also been observed for a wide variety of stimuli and tasks (Ben-Yehudah and Ahissar, 
2004; Oganian and Ahissar, 2012) and has been advanced as a potential core deficit in this 
disorder (Ahissar, 2007). Similarly, individuals with dyslexia tend to exhibit reduced implicit 
learning in both perceptual (Gabay and Holt, 2015) and perceptual-motor tasks (Lum et al., 
2013; Menghini et al., 2006; Stoodley et al., 2008). In general, individuals with dyslexia 
tend to exhibit a reduced ability to exploit regularities in stimuli to enhance performance.
These nonverbal deficits in individuals with dyslexia may be related to known cortical 
mechanisms of perceptual learning in animals. Rapid neural adaptation to perceptual context 
has been associated with improved detection behaviors in animal models (Edeline et al., 
1993; Fritz et al., 2003; Jääskeläinen et al., 2007). Moreover, neural adaptation in sensory 
cortices to the consistent features of perceptual noise has been shown to be an important 
mechanism for improving perception in adverse conditions (Atiani et al., 2009). A large 
behavioral literature now shows that perceptual noise is significantly more detrimental to 
individuals with dyslexia than controls across auditory, visual, verbal, and non-verbal tasks 
(Chait et al., 2007; Sperling et al., 2005, 2006; Ziegler et al., 2009), with neural evidence

 also showing noise-exclusion deficits in dyslexia (White-Schwoch et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 
2013). Based on these behavioral effects in dyslexia, and corresponding neurophysiological 
effects in animal models and humans, we hypothesized that rapid neural adaptation may be 
dysfunctional in individuals with dyslexia.
Neural adaptation can be assessed in human participants via functional magnetic resonance 
imaging (fMRI) paradigms that measure the difference in blood oxygenation level dependent 
(BOLD) signals between blocks of repeated stimuli (“adaptation”) and blocks of numerous, 
distinct stimuli without repetition (Grill-Spector and Malach, 2001; Krekelberg et al., 2006). 
Adaptation fMRI is a powerful tool for investigating neurophysiological function in vivo: 
there is a strong correspondence between regionally localized BOLD adaptation effects and 
the stimulus selectivity of individual neurons (Bell et al., 2011; Sawamura et al., 2005, 
2006), and adaptation paradigms have been used extensively to map stimulus selectivity in 
visual and auditory cortices (Chandrasekaran et al., 2011; Weiner et al., 2010). Adaptation 
paradigms in fMRI also have several advantages over alternative methods for interrogating 
neural adaptation, such as the mismatch negativity (MMN) and other scalp 
electrophysiology measures: namely, adaptation fMRI can ascertain not only the magnitude 
of adaptation, but also its precise spatial localization. Likewise, it can assess diverse 
perceptual domains while using consistent stimulation paradigms.
A prominent, ecological example of rapid perceptual adaptation in human behavior is 
adaptation to a speaker’s voice. Listeners rapidly learn the correspondence between a 
speaker’s idiosyncratic phonetics and their long-term phonological representations, which 
makes speech perception faster and more accurate (Mullennix and Pisoni, 1990; Nygaard et 
al., 1994). Neuroimaging experiments of speech perception have shown that listening to 
speech from a consistent speaker results in adaptation (reduced activation) in auditory 
cortices (Belin and Zatorre, 2003; Wong et al., 2004). In Experiment 1, we measured 
neurophysiological adaptation to speech from a consistent speaker versus multiple different 
speakers while participants performed a speech perception task (auditory word-to-picture 
matching). We hypothesized that individuals with dyslexia would exhibit diminished 
neurophysiological adaptation to phonetic consistency during speech perception compared 
to controls, following their behavioral impairments in this domain (Perrachione et al., 2011).
We further sought to determine whether neural adaptation deficits in dyslexia are specific to 
phonetic/phonological processing of speech, or whether they might be observed for repeated 
stimuli more generally. In four additional experiments (Experiments 2a–d), we measured 
neurophysiological adaptation to the repeated presentation of a single stimulus token versus 
multiple, different tokens of that stimulus category for (a) spoken words, (b) written words, 
(c) photographs of objects, and (d) photographs of faces. Different conclusions about the 
role that adaptation deficits may play in reading impairment can be drawn based on the 
stimulus types for which diminished adaptation is observed. If adaptation deficits are not 
observed for any conditions in Experiment 2, we can conclude they are related specifically 
to phonetic/phonological learning. If they are observed for spoken, but not written words, we 
can conclude adaptation deficits are specific to auditory processing of speech, whereas, if 
adaptation is diminished for both spoken and written words, but not objects or faces, we can 
infer a core dysfunction of linguistic processing in dyslexia. However, if adaptation is also

 diminished for the non-linguistic stimulus categories of visual objects and faces, we must 
consider that dysfunction of rapid neural adaptation during perceptual processing may be a 
generalized property of the brain in dyslexia. Finally, in Experiment 3, we investigated 
whether diminished neural adaptation was also present in young children with dyslexia. We 
hypothesized that, if dysfunctional neurophysiological adaptation underlies reading 
impairment (rather than being a response to the impairment), it should be observed even in 
early stages of reading development.
RESULTS
Experiment 1
Adaptation to the consistent phonetic-phonological correspondence of speech from a single 
talker is a hallmark of abstract phonological processing in speech perception (Mullennix and 
Pisoni, 1990; Nygaard et al., 1994). We measured neurophysiological adaptation to the 
consistent phonetic features of speech in a block-design, sparse-sampling fMRI paradigm in 
which listeners heard spoken words and matched them to pictures (Figs. 1A and S1). In each 
block, we varied whether words were spoken by a single voice (“Adapt” condition) vs. 
multiple different voices (“No-Adapt” condition), with the expectation that listeners would 
show neural adaptation to the consistent voice (Wong et al., 2004). Adults with dyslexia 
(defined as a lifelong history of reading impairment and current performance in the bottom 
25th percentile on two or more subtests of reading speed or accuracy) and control adults 
participated in this experiment (Tables 1 and S1).
Participants successfully maintained attention to the auditory stimuli throughout the word-
to-picture matching task, as indicated by near-ceiling accuracy in both groups (control = 
99.2%; dyslexia = 98.8%). A repeated-measures ANOVA for effects of group and condition 
revealed significantly greater accuracy in controls (F1,33 = 5.14, p = 0.03, η2 = 0.07), but no 
effect of condition (p = 0.64) or interaction (p = 0.81). The same test for response time 
revealed a significant effect of condition (F1,33 = 53.62, p < 0.0001, η2 = 0.18) – with faster 
response times in the Adapt condition (502ms vs. 563ms) – but no effect of group (p = 0.18) 
or interaction (p = 0.50).
In the control group, significant neural adaptation (No-Adapt > Adapt contrast) was 
observed in two bilateral clusters, each extending throughout superior temporal gyrus (STG; 
including Heschl’s gyrus (HG) and planum temporale (PT)) and into posterior middle 
temporal gyrus (pMTG; Fig. 1B). In the dyslexia group, the magnitude and extent of 
adaptation were markedly reduced, with smaller clusters of significant adaptation 
encompassing only bilateral HG, PT, and right pSTG (Fig. 1C). There was no repetition-
related enhancement (Adapt > No-Adapt) in either group. There were no overall group 
differences in the basic Task > Rest contrast (Fig. S1).
Compared to the control group, there was significantly less adaptation in the dyslexia group 
in clusters encompassing STG, PT, suparmarginal gyrus (SMG), and pMTG bilaterally (Fig. 
1D). There were no clusters in which the dyslexia group showed more adaptation than 
controls. The group difference in adaptation was due an increasing difference between the 
Adapt and No-Adapt conditions over the course of stimulation in the control group, whereas

 the dyslexia group showed similar response magnitude to both conditions throughout (Fig. 
1E–H and Table S4).
We further explored how the magnitude of auditory adaptation in individuals with dyslexia 
was related to their reading abilities. Better core reading abilities in the dyslexia group, as 
measured by efficiency applying phonological and structural rules in decoding novel word 
forms (Woodcock, 1998), were associated with greater adaptation in both right (r = 0.56, p < 
0.02) and left (r = 0.54, p < 0.03) planum temporale – an area known to be involved in 
phonetic-phonological abstraction in speech-sound processing (Graves et al., 2008; Griffiths 
and Warren, 2002).
Experiment 2
Following the discovery in Experiment 1 of significantly diminished auditory adaptation in 
dyslexia to the phonetic-phonological correspondence of speech, we conducted four follow-
up experiments intended to determine the extent of neurophysiological adaptation 
differences in dyslexia. We investigated whether adaptation differences would be limited to 
auditory stimuli or to stimuli with linguistic content, or whether diminished adaptation 
would be observed for the repetition of stimuli of any kind, indicating dysfunctional 
adaptation as a generalized feature of information processing in the dyslexic brain. A new 
sample of adult participants with and without dyslexia was recruited for these experiments, 
with the same inclusionary criteria as Experiment 1 (Tables 1 and S2).
Experiment 2a: Spoken Words—We first investigated whether adaptation in the brains 
of adults with and without dyslexia would differ to a more obvious repetition of auditory 
stimuli than the subtle differences between talkers’ voices used in Experiment 1. In this 
experiment, we measured neurophysiological adaptation to blocks with the repeated 
presentation of a single spoken word (“Adapt”) vs. blocks with multiple different spoken 
words (“No-Adapt”) from a single speaker (Fig. 2A).
In the control group, hearing multiple repetitions of the same word resulted in significant 
adaptation (No-Adapt > Adapt) in left anterior STG and dorsal superior temporal sulcus 
(STS), as well as right aSTG, pMTG, and frontal operculum (FOC) (Fig. 2B). As before, the 
magnitude and extent of adaptation were markedly reduced in the dyslexia group, with 
smaller clusters of significant adaptation encompassing only left aSTG and right FOC. In 
both groups, there was a single cluster of repetition-related enhancement (greater BOLD 
response in the Adapt than No-Adapt condition) in left anterior supramarginal gyrus. There 
were no overall differences in the groups’ task-related activations (Fig. S1C,D).
The dyslexia group again exhibited significantly reduced adaptation compared to controls 
throughout perisylvian speech areas, including left STG, pMTG, and ventral premotor 
cortex, as well as right aSTG, planum polare, ventral premotor cortex, and pMTG. There 
were no clusters in which the dyslexia group showed more adaptation than controls. 
Whereas stimulus repetition attenuated neurophysiological response in the control group, 
individuals with dyslexia showed no such distinction in response magnitude (Fig. 2E,G). 
Likewise, whereas the magnitude of adaptation increased over time in controls, even

 multiple repetitions of a single adapting stimulus did not attenuate the response in dyslexia 
(Fig. 2F,H, Table S4).
As in Experiment 1, we investigated whether the magnitude of neural adaptation in 
individuals with dyslexia was related to their reading abilities. We observed a positive 
correlation between greater adaptation in left PT and better reading skills (Woodcock, 1998) 
in individuals with dyslexia (r = 0.42, p = 0.05).
Experiment 2b: Written Words—We next investigated whether the control and dyslexia 
groups would differ in neural adaptation to the repeated presentation of written words (text) 
– still linguistic, but now visual stimuli. We measured neurophysiological adaptation to text 
by contrasting blocks of viewing multiple different written words versus blocks with the 
repeated presentation of a single written word (Fig. 3A).
In the control group, significant adaptation to the repeated presentation of a written word 
was observed in temporal (fusiform gyrus (FusG), inferior temporal gyrus (ITG), pSTG, and 
pMTG), frontal (inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), FOC, premotor cortex, and pre-supplementary 
motor area (SMA)), and visual (pericalcarine) cortices – all in the left hemisphere only (Fig. 
3B). In dyslexia, the only cluster of significant adaptation to repeated visual words was 
found in left FOC (Fig. 3C). The dyslexia group also showed two clusters of significant 
enhancement in right pMTG and bilateral precuneus, with both areas also showing task-
related deactivations (Fig. S2) (Buckner et al., 2008). Although there was a trend towards 
overall less activation to text stimuli in dyslexia, this Task > Rest group difference was not 
significant (Fig. S2C,D).
Compared to the control group, the dyslexia group exhibited significantly attenuated 
adaptation throughout FusG, pMTG, PT, SMG, and occipital cortex (Fig. 3D) – left 
hemisphere areas comprising the core of a network for reading (Dehaene and Cohen, 2011; 
McCandliss et al., 2003; Price, 2012; Price and Devlin, 2011). Additional clusters of 
significantly reduced adaptation were found in right insula, left motor cortex, and right 
angular gyrus (AG). There were no clusters in which the dyslexia group showed more 
adaptation than controls. Adaptation differences in FusG were the result of a smaller 
difference between the No-Adapt and Adapt conditions in the dyslexia group than in 
controls (Fig. 3E,F), with increasing group differences over time (Table S4). The group 
difference in pMTG (an area associated with semantic processing; Hickok and Poeppel, 
2007) was qualitatively different: whereas the control group showed modest but non-
significant adaptation in this region, the dyslexia group showed a trend for enhancement, 
with greater activation the more times a written word was repeated (Fig. 3G,H, Table S4). 
Unlike speech stimuli, and unlike Experiment 1, we did not observe any correlation between 
adaptation in ventral or lateral temporal areas and reading ability in dyslexia.
Experiment 2c: Objects—In addition to linguistic stimuli in auditory and visual 
modalities, we also investigated whether reduced adaptation in dyslexia would be observed 
for nonverbal visual stimuli such as color photographs of objects. We measured 
neurophysiological adaptation by contrasting blocks of viewing photographs of multiple

 different objects versus blocks with the repeated presentation of the same photograph of a 
single object (Fig. 4A).
In both control and dyslexia groups, significant adaptation to the repeated presentation of a 
photograph of an object was observed throughout visual and ventral temporal cortices 
known to process visual objects (Malach et al., 1995), including ITG, FusG, and lateral 
occipital cortex (LOC) extending dorsally into superior parietal lobule (SPL), as well as in 
bilateral inferior frontal sulcus (IFS), FOC, and preSMA (Fig. 4B,C). Both groups also 
showed significant enhancement in bilateral PT and precuneus (a task-deactivated area), and 
controls showed enhancement in two other task-deactivated areas: medial prefrontal cortex 
(MePFC) and superior frontal gyrus (SFG).
The magnitude of adaptation to object repetition in the dyslexia group was significantly less 
than in the control group throughout occipital and ventral temporal areas, including ITG, 
FusG, and LOC extending dorsally into SPL (Fig. 4D). Stimulus repetition resulted in a 
greater reduction of the BOLD response over time in the control group than in the dyslexia 
group (Fig. 4E–H and Table S4). There were no clusters in task-activated cortex in which the 
dyslexia group showed more adaptation than the control group. Better reading skills in the 
dyslexia group were significantly correlated with greater adaptation to repeated visual 
objects in both left (r = 0.45, p < 0.03) and right LOC (r = 0.42, p < 0.05).
Experiment 2d: Faces—Although putatively nonverbal, objects are nameable, and visual 
processing of objects may nonetheless involve automatic activation of their linguistic labels 
(Chabal and Marian, 2015), which may be impaired in dyslexia (Norton and Wolf, 2012; 
Wolf, 1984); therefore, we lastly investigated whether reduced adaptation in dyslexia would 
be observed for non-nameable visual stimuli such as photographs of unfamiliar faces. We 
measured neurophysiological adaptation to faces by contrasting blocks of viewing 
photographs of multiple different people’s faces versus blocks with the repeated presentation 
of the same photograph of a single person’s face (Fig. 5A).
In the control group, repeated presentation of the same picture of a face yielded significant 
adaptation throughout ventral temporal and visual cortices, including bilateral FusG and 
LOC, and right amygdala and anterior hippocampus (Fig. 5B). In the dyslexia group, 
significant adaptation was only observed in smaller bilateral FusG clusters (Fig. 5C). The 
dyslexia group exhibited significantly less adaptation than the control group in numerous 
regions associated with face processing (Kanwisher and Yovel, 2006; Tsao and Livingstone, 
2008), including bilateral FusG and LOC; right hippocampus, temporal pole, and amygdala; 
and left premotor cortex and insula (Fig. 5D). As in all other experiments, this group 
difference was related to a greater reduction of the BOLD response to repeated stimuli in the 
control group than in the dyslexia group (Fig. 5E–H and Table S4). There were no clusters in 
which the dyslexia group showed more adaptation than controls, and we did not observe any 
correlation between adaptation in occipital or ventral temporal areas and reading ability in 
dyslexia.
To confirm that the group difference in adaptation did not reflect more heterogeneous 
localization of adaptation effects in the dyslexia group than in the control group, we

 performed an additional analysis that measured adaptation only in the face-selective clusters 
of each participant. The fusiform face area (FFA; Kanwisher et al., 1997) was localized in 
individual participants by contrasting activation to faces vs. objects and identifying the 
anterior-most discrete face-selective cluster in the occipitofusiform region. The FFA was 
successfully localized in 22 participants in the dyslexia group and 18 participants in the 
control group (Fig. 6A). The probability of localizing an FFA did not differ by group (χ2 = 
0.63, p = 0.43), nor was there a group difference in the threshold at which the FFA cluster 
could be localized (independent-sample t38 = 0.06, p = 0.95) or the volume of the FFA 
(independent-sample t38 = 0.65, p = 0.52), indicating no difference in cortical specialization 
for faces between the two groups. The control group showed significant adaptation in their 
FFAs to repeated faces (paired t17 = 6.13, p < 0.00002), whereas adaptation in the dyslexia 
group was not significant (paired t21 = 1.67, p = 0.11). The magnitude of FFA adaptation 
was significantly less in the dyslexia group than in controls (independent-sample t38 = 3.37, 
p < 0.002) (Fig. 6B). As in the whole-brain analyses, the group difference in adaptation 
reflected an increasingly smaller response to repeated stimuli in the control group than in 
dyslexia (Fig. 6C and Table S4). (We attempted a similar analysis for the visual word form 
area (VWFA; McCandliss et al., 2003) in Experiment 2b, but were unable to reliably isolate 
this region in our participants using a Words > Objects contrast.)
Experiment 3
Having seen robust and apparently domain-general neurophysiological adaptation deficits in 
adults with dyslexia, we further asked whether reading-ability-related adaptation differences 
were evident in emerging readers (age 6–9 years). We repeated Experiment 2a with young 
children with dyslexia and their age-matched peers with typical reading development. We 
measured neurophysiological adaptation by contrasting blocks of a single, repeated spoken 
word versus blocks with multiple different spoken words from a single speaker (Fig. 7A).
Children with and without dyslexia successfully maintained attention to the auditory stimuli 
throughout in both conditions, as indicated by near-ceiling accuracy in both groups (control 
= 98.6%; dyslexia = 97.8%). A repeated-measures ANOVA for effects of group and 
condition on accuracy revealed no effect of group (F1,43 = 1.64, p = 0.21), no effect of 
condition (p = 0.17), and no interaction (p = 0.33). The same test for response time revealed 
a significant effect of condition (F1,43 = 6.16, p < 0.02, η2 = 0.03) – with faster response 
times in the Adapt condition (977ms vs. 1044ms) – but no effect of group (p = 0.59) or 
interaction (p = 0.56).
In control children, hearing multiple repetitions of the same word resulted in significant 
adaptation in bilateral STG, PT, and SPL (Fig. 7B). For children with dyslexia, however, 
there were no areas exhibiting significant adaptation (Fig. 7C). There were no clusters of 
repetition-related enhancement in either group. Adaptation in children with dyslexia was 
significantly less than that of controls in left PT, STG, and IFG (Fig. 7D). This group 
difference was the result of an increasingly large reduction of response to stimulus repetition 
over time in the control group than in the dyslexia group, who in turn showed almost no 
response distinction between the Adapt and No-Adapt conditions (Fig. 7E–H and Table S4). 
There were no clusters in which the dyslexia group showed more adaptation than controls.

 Because the children with dyslexia were in only preliminary stages of reading development, 
we investigated whether the magnitude of auditory adaptation was related to their 
phonological awareness – an important preliterate skill (Bradley and Bryant, 1983) that is a 
better predictor of long-term reading outcomes than early reading abilities (MacDonald and 
Cornwall, 1995). We observed positive correlations in the children with dyslexia between 
the magnitude of adaptation in left PT (r = 0.46, p < 0.04) and left aSTG (r = 0.50, p < 
0.025) and their phonological awareness (Wagner et al., 1999).
DISCUSSION
Across six experiments, we found that rapid neural adaptation, as indexed by repetition-
induced reduction of the fMRI BOLD signal (Grill-Spector and Malach, 2001), was 
diminished in children and adults with dyslexia for every stimulus type assessed – auditory 
language, visual language, visual objects, and faces. This deficit in adaptation was found 
selectively in the brain regions known to be critically involved in processing each stimulus 
type (Bell et al., 2011; Chandrasekaran et al., 2011; Kanwisher et al., 1997; Malach et al., 
1995; McCandliss et al., 2003; Weiner et al., 2010). Correspondingly, the amount of 
preserved adaptation in these stimulus-specific brain regions was related to the reading skills 
of adults and preliterate skills of children with dyslexia. The breadth of this deficit – across 
ages, brain regions, and stimulus types – suggests that dysfunction of neural adaptation may 
be an important neurophysiological difference in many individuals with dyslexia.
Diminished neural adaptation to linguistic stimuli parallels known behavioral deficits in 
these domains. Adults with dyslexia exhibited less neural adaptation to the speech of a 
consistent talker, corresponding to their reduced behavioral ability to learn the specific 
phonetic-phonological features of individual voices (Perrachione et al., 2011) and impaired 
implicit learning of auditory categories (Gabay and Holt, 2015). Adaptation deficits in 
dyslexia cannot be ascribed to failure to notice the subtle repetition of stimulus features 
(voices) in Experiment 1, because even the highly salient, multiple repetitions of single 
spoken or written words in Experiment 2 resulted in less neural adaptation in dyslexia than 
controls. Furthermore, these adaptation deficits were found in children with dyslexia early in 
their literacy development, suggesting that reduced sensitivity to the repetition of language 
stimuli is present even before reading skills have been extensively trained (Boets, 2014; 
Goswami, 2015). This parallels the observation that perceptual adaptation is related to 
preliteracy and language skills even before children begin to learn to read (Banai and Yifat, 
2012).
Perhaps more surprisingly, we also observed adaptation deficits to repetition of non-
linguistic stimuli such as objects and faces, although strictly perceptual deficits for these 
stimuli are not generally observed in dyslexia (Rüsseler et al., 2003; cf. Sigurdardottir et al., 
2015). This suggests that, in dyslexia, the general capacity for perceptual processes to 
establish short-term representations of stimulus consistency may be impaired (Ahissar et al., 
2006; Chandrasekaran et al., 2009; Hornickel and Kraus, 2013; Jaffe-Dax et al., 2015;

 An impairment in neural adaptation, which reflects the neural processes involved in 
establishing robust short-term perceptual representations (Alain et al., 2007; Garrido et al., 
2009; Jääskeläinen et al., 2007; Khouri and Nelken, 2015) provides a framework for 
understanding how several other behavioral and neural differences observed in dyslexia may 
form a constellation of low-level, adaptation-related deficits. First, individuals with dyslexia 
may have an impairment “anchoring” to consistent stimulus statistics in order to enhance 
perceptual thresholds (Ahissar et al., 2006; Banai and Ahissar, 2010), a behavioral effect 
reflected in rapid neural adaptation (Fritz et al., 2003; Garrido et al., 2009). Second, 
individuals with dyslexia are also frequently observed to have impairments recognizing both 
auditory and visual stimuli in the presence of noise (Sperling et al., 2005, 2006; Ziegler et 
al., 2009). Correspondingly, short-term adaptation of auditory and visual cortices to the 
statistics of noise facilitate perception in animal models (Atiani et al., 2009), and neural 
adaptation may also support noise exclusion in humans (Parbery-Clark et al., 2011). Third, 
neural coding deficits in auditory thalamus and brainstem have been found in dyslexia for 
tasks that use consistent stimulus or noise features (Chandrasekaran et al., 2009; Díaz et al., 
2012). Our observation of dysfunction in cortical adaptation suggests these may be systems-
level deficits, given corticofugal signaling is responsible for modulating auditory 
representations in thalamus and brainstem (Chandrasekaran et al., 2014; Suga et al., 2002). 
Finally, individuals with dyslexia may exhibit differences in gamma-band neural 
synchronization to auditory stimuli (Lehongre et al., 2011). Synchronous neural activity at 
these frequencies is induced by neural adaptation (Hansen and Dragoi, 2011), and such 
neural entrainment to stimulus consistency aids perception (Giraud and Poeppel, 2012; Park 
et al., 2015). This cluster of adaptation-related impairments may arise from dysfunction in 
common or related neurobiological mechanisms – namely, ones that constrain the extent to 
which the dyslexic brain can overcome internal noise and establish the perceptual constancy 
that underlies short-term perceptual facilitation and supports long-term perceptual learning 
(Hornickel and Kraus, 2013; Jääskeläinen et al., 2007; Jaffe-Dax et al., 2015).
Could adaptation differences reflect attentional differences?
The suggestion that visual-spatial attention deficits may, in some cases, underlie impaired 
reading (Franceschini et al., 2012; Vidyasagar and Pammer, 2010) warrants considering 
whether diminished adaptation in dyslexia might have an attentional origin. There are 
several reasons why it is unlikely that the present results reflect an impairment in voluntary 
or intentional deployment of top-down attention. First, between-group differences in 
adaptation were always observed in the cortical areas specifically implicated in processing 
stimuli of each type, not areas associated with volitional, top-down attention (Hopfinger et 
al., 2000; Womelsdorf and Everling, 2015). Second, substantial fMRI adaptation is readily 
observed in both attentive and passive tasks (Kourtzi and Kanwisher, 2001; Larsson and 
Smith, 2012; Sawamura et al., 2005). Third, our original observation of adaptation 
differences (Experiment 1) occurred in a speech perception task where the attentional 
demands of the Adapt and No-Adapt conditions did not differ.
Attention may nonetheless affect adaptation in subtler ways. Stimuli in Adapt conditions 
were highly repetitive and thus highly predictable. Perceptual expectations influence the 
magnitude of neural adaptation (Costa-Faidella et al., 2011; Summerfield et al., 2008; 
Perrachione et al.

 Todorovic et al., 2011). Likewise, animal models have shown that rapid changes in neural 
responses to repeated stimuli require top-down neuromodulatory input (Fritz et al., 2003; 
Froemke et al., 2007). Diminished adaptation in dyslexia might therefore represent a failure 
to generate robust, top-down perceptual expectations (Jaffe-Dax et al., 2015): Higher cortical 
areas may not provide appropriate feedback signals to sensory cortices to facilitate 
adaptation (Boets et al., 2013; Saygin et al., 2013; Yeatman et al., 2011). Alternatively, there 
is some evidence for microanatomical abnormalities that disrupt laminar structure in 
dyslexia (Galaburda et al., 1994), and disruptions to the local organization of laminar 
circuits may interfere with the local or long-range connections supporting adaptation, which 
depends on finely tuned neuromodulatory input (Froemke et al., 2007) and lamina-specific 
synchronization in sensory cortex (Hansen and Dragoi, 2011).
General neural dysfunction and specific reading impairment
A widely replicated finding in the neuroscience of dyslexia is the observation of reduced 
activation to print in the canonical reading network, and particularly in left occipitotemporal 
cortex (Paulesu et al., 2014; Shaywitz et al., 1998). However, the causal connection between 
developmental dyslexia and reduced sensitivity to print this region remains unclear. On the 
one hand, dysfunction of left occipitotemporal cortex itself could be a pathway to dyslexia. 
Alternatively, reduced sensitivity to print in this region could result from developmental 
differences in other processes that are compromised in dyslexia prior to learning to read, 
such as phonemic awareness in speech (Bradley and Bryant, 1983) or rapid naming of visual 
stimuli (Norton and Wolf, 2012). Weaknesses in these preliteracy skills may encumber the 
functional integration of occipitotemporal cortex into a robust reading network. 
Correspondingly, there has been a strong interest in identifying low-level deficits in dyslexia 
that might serve as neural precursors to explain weaknesses in these preliteracy skills.
A challenge for any hypothesis of low-level impairments in dyslexia is to explain how a 
“general” biological dysfunction gives rise to a “specific” impairment in reading without 
impacting other complex behaviors. For instance, proponents of various low-level auditory 
deficits as an explanation for poor reading (Goswami, 2011; Tallal and Piercy, 1973) must 
offer an account for how these interfere specifically with reading but do not produce 
apparent disruptions to complex auditory abilities like perceiving speech and music. 
Likewise, proponents of core visual deficits (Franceschini et al., 2012; Stein, 2001; 
Vidyasagar and Pammer, 2010) must be able to explain how these impairments affect 
reading, but do not result in correspondingly serious disruptions to other complex visual 
behaviors like recognizing objects or driving a car.
A dysfunction of neural adaptation differs from other low-level hypotheses in that it does not 
posit an impairment in processing specific stimulus features that are critical for other 
auditory or visual abilities. Instead, it suggests that there may be a general impairment in 
processes that facilitate perception under adverse or challenging conditions (Jääskeläinen et 
al., 2007), which, at its core, represents an impairment in mechanisms for rapid perceptual 
learning – including learning the robust speech-sound categories necessary for sound-to-
symbol matching in reading (Bradley and Bryant, 1983). Neural adaptation facilitates 
behaviors such as detecting stimuli in noise (Atiani et al., 2009; Chandrasekaran et al., 2009; 
Perrachione et al.

 Parbery-Clark et al., 2011), discriminating subtle stimulus differences (Edeline et al., 1993; 
Fritz et al., 2003), and rapid learning of new perceptual categories (Alain et al., 2007; 
Garrido et al., 2009). Correspondingly, for all of these behaviors facilitated by adaptation, 
significant deficits have consistently been reported in dyslexia.
Although the brain has evolved to be computationally powerful for solving certain types of 
problems such as perceiving speech and recognizing objects, learning to read differs in that 
it is a cultural invention imposing itself upon circuitry that evolved for other purposes 
(Dehaene et al., 2010; McCandliss et al., 2003). Learning to read depends on the ability to 
orchestrate, across two perceptual modalities, the complex correspondence between abstract 
phonological representations of speech sounds and abstract orthographic representations of 
written symbols – a task that becomes disproportionately more difficult if either type of 
representation, or access to them, is impaired. Correspondingly, learning to read is one of the 
most complex examples of human learning, the demands of which are evident from its 
lengthy and explicit instruction throughout childhood and into adulthood. There is no other 
human behavior that approaches reading’s demands for coordinating multimodal perceptual 
representations and cognitive processes. In this way, a general neural dysfunction that is 
subtly detrimental to other behaviors may be substantially detrimental for learning to read.
Extensions and limitations of the fMRI adaptation technique
The specific physiological mechanisms that give rise to adaptation in the BOLD signal are 
not yet fully understood (Grill-Spector et al., 2006; Krekelberg et al., 2006; Sawamura et al., 
2006), and repetition-related fMRI adaptation is likely to reflect a variety of diverse 
neurophysiological processes depending on variables like the cortical location (Weiner et al., 
2010), stimulation paradigm (Müller et al., 2013), and task demands (Jiang et al., 2013) in 
which it is observed. Interestingly, fMRI adaptation is attenuated for perceptually noisy 
stimuli (Turk-Browne et al., 2007), paralleling hypotheses that neural representations 
themselves may be disproportionately noisy in dyslexia (Hornickel and Kraus, 2013; Jaffe-
Dax et al., 2015; Ziegler et al., 2009).
Although the coarseness of fMRI signals precludes this tool from resolving the circuit- or 
cellular-level source of adaptation impairments in dyslexia by itself, the present observations 
provide a stronger foundation for the targeted pursuit of neurophysiological differences in 
dyslexia informed by basic research in animal models. For instance, the necessary role of 
cholinergic neuromodulation for rapid neural adaptation and consequent behavioral 
enhancement is well known at the cellular level (Froemke et al., 2007; Suga et al., 2002), 
with similar effects shown in BOLD imaging (Thiel et al., 2002). Atypical cerebral 
concentration of neurometabolic precursors to acetylcholine have been found in dyslexia 
(Bruno et al., 2013; Pugh et al., 2014). Advances in cholinergic radioligands now permit 
targeted investigation of this neurotransmitter in behavioral adaptation tasks and in dyslexia. 
Although this example is speculative, our observation of generalized differences in 
neurophysiological adaptation contributes to a growing literature from which we can begin 
to develop a systems- (as opposed to cognitive-) neuroscientific framework for investigating 
dyslexia.

 The complexity of reading makes successfully learning this skill vulnerable to a broad range 
of linguistic, visual, and attentional dysfunctions that may occur in variable mixtures in 
individual children with dyslexia. Correspondingly, although perceptual adaptation deficits 
in dyslexia have been observed across a large number of studies and diverse range of tasks, 
some studies have found deficits on only a subset of tasks employed (Beattie et al., 2011), 
for only a subset of participants (Willburger and Landerl, 2010), or for none at all (Wijnen et 
al., 2012). The results from the present study, however, provide multiple converging lines of 
evidence for a substantive relationship between neural adaptation deficits and reading 
impairment. We not only observed that the degree of neural adaptation in task-relevant brain 
regions was significantly correlated with reading abilities in adults with dyslexia and with 
phonological skills in children with dyslexia, we also observed consistent and significant 
group differences in neural adaptation for all tasks. Such correlations, combined with 
reliable group differences, correspond to the two ways that neuroimaging and behavioral 
studies are able to empirically characterize differences between typical and dyslexic brain 
function.
Finally, although we observed consistently diminished adaptation in dyslexia, and although 
the magnitude of that adaptation was related to reading ability in dyslexia, our choice to use 
high-level, perceptually complex stimuli in our adaptation paradigms meant we could not 
observe whether the degree of neural adaptation was directly related to perceptual 
adaptation, as would have been possible with a task designed to evaluate perceptual 
thresholds (Braida et al., 1984). Nevertheless, two-way relationships between neural and 
perceptual adaptation (Alain et al., 2007), perceptual adaptation and reading abilities 
(Ahissar et al., 2006; Banai and Yifat, 2012), and neural adaptation and reading impairment 
(present work) have now been repeatedly demonstrated, and confirmation of the three-way 
relationship among these three factors can be made in future studies.
An emerging picture of the dyslexic brain
Dyslexia is a specific impairment in developing typical reading abilities. Correspondingly, 
structural and functional disruptions to the network of brain areas known to support reading 
are consistently observed in dyslexia (Norton et al., 2015). However, these observations 
confound cause and consequence, especially since reading is a cultural invention that must 
make use of existing circuitry evolved for other purposes (Dehaene and Cohen, 2007; 
Dehaene et al., 2010). In this way, differences between brains that exert more subtle 
influences on non-reading behaviors are likely to be the culprit in a cascade of perceptual 
and mnemonic challenges that interfere with the development of typical reading abilities. 
Recent research has begun to elucidate a cluster of behaviorally-distinct but potentially 
physiologically-related impairments that are evinced by individuals with reading difficulties 
and observable in their brains. Through this collection of neural signatures – including 
unstable neural representations (Hornickel and Kraus, 2013), diminished top-down reflexive 
control (Boets, 2014; Boets et al., 2013; Chandrasekaran et al., 2009), susceptibility to noise 
(Sperling et al., 2005; Ziegler et al., 2009), and inability to construct robust short-term 
perceptual representations (Díaz et al., 2012; Jaffe-Dax et al., 2015; Lehongre et al., 2011) – 
we are beginning to see that reading impairments can arise from general dysfunction in the 
processes supported by rapid neural adaptation.

 EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Participants
Separate groups of adults completed Experiments 1 (N = 19 dyslexia, 19 control) and 2 (N = 
24 dyslexia, 23 control). Children with dyslexia (N = 26) and with typical reading 
development (N = 25) completed Experiment 3. See Tables S1–S3 for participant assessment 
and characterization.
Task and Stimuli
In Experiment 1, participants matched auditory words to pictures during a 42-minute, 
sparse-sampling, block-design fMRI task. In the No-Adapt condition, words were spoken by 
four different voices; in the Adapt condition, words were spoken by one consistent voice.
In Experiments 2 and 3, participants passively attended speech, text, objects, or faces during 
separate 10-minute, continuous-sampling, block-design fMRI tasks. Eight unique stimuli 
were presented in No-Adapt blocks; a single stimulus was repeated eight times in Adapt 
blocks. Children underwent only the speech task.
MRI Analysis
Functional data were preprocessed and modeled in SPM8, Freesurfer, and Nipype. Model 
and contrast estimation were conducted in EPI space; contrast images were coregistered to 
participants’ anatomy, then normalized to MNI space. Group-level mixed-effects models 
assessed adaptation within and between groups.

 Highlights
•
We found reduced neurophysiological adaptation in 
adults and children with dyslexia.
•
In dyslexia, adaptation to speech from a consistent voice 
was significantly reduced.
•
Repetition of words, objects, and faces also elicited less 
adaptation in dyslexia.
•
Reading skills in dyslexia were related to the degree of 
neural adaptation.

 Figure 1. Reduced neural adaptation in dyslexia when listening to speech from a consistent voice 
vs. many voices
(A) Schematic of the stimulation paradigm (detailed design in Fig. S1). (B) Magnitude of 
neural adaptation (difference in activation for No-Adapt > Adapt conditions) for the control 
group; areas of significant adaptation are outlined with white contours and labeled. The 
control group exhibited significant adaptation in bilateral STG and pMTG when listening to 
speech from a single, consistent voice (Adapt) versus many different voices (No-Adapt). (C) 
Magnitude of neural adaptation for the dyslexia group, with significant, though weaker, 
adaptation in bilateral STG. (D) Areas of significantly reduced adaptation in the dyslexia 
group compared to controls. The magnitude of adaptation in the dyslexia group was 
significantly reduced throughout perisylvian areas for speech processing, including bilateral 
STG, SMG, and pMTG. (EH) These plots explore the nature of the group differences in 
adaptation. (E) Barplots: magnitude of neural response (activation) by condition (No-Adapt: 
“N-A,” blue; Adapt: “A,” red) and group (controls: lighter bars; dyslexia: darker bars) in left 
PT. Error bars denote standard error of the mean (s.e.m.). Boxplots: difference in 
neurophysiological response between conditions (adaptation) in left PT by group. Shaded 
regions include the middle 50% of the distribution; whiskers extend to the maximum and 
minimum points; solid dark lines indicate the median. (F) Mean time course (solid lines) ± 
s.e.m. of BOLD responses to the No-Adapt and Adapt conditions by group, and their 
difference (adaptation, rightmost panel), in left PT. The onset and duration of stimulation are 
indicated by the vertical dotted line the solid horizontal bar above the abscissa, respectively. 
The adaptation effect is evident when the red line (Adapt condition) is beneath the blue line 
(No-Adapt condition), and reflected in a positive deflection of the difference trace, shown

 for each group in the rightmost panel. (G,H) As above, for left STG. The control group 
exhibited greater difference between conditions, with adaptation magnitude increasing 
across the stimulation period, whereas the dyslexia group showed little difference between 
conditions, with an increased response to repetition in the short term. (See also Figure S1 
and Table S4.)

 Figure 2. Reduced neural adaptation in dyslexia when listening to repeated speech
(A) Schematic of the stimulation paradigm. (B) The control group exhibited significant 
adaptation in bilateral STG and right pMTG. (C) Adaptation in the dyslexia group was 
significant, though weaker, in left STG only. (D) The magnitude of adaptation in the 
dyslexia group was significantly reduced throughout perisylvian areas for speech processing, 
including bilateral aSTG and pMTG. (E–H) The control group exhibited a consistently 
greater difference between conditions, with the magnitude of adaptation increasing across 
the stimulation period, whereas the dyslexia group showed little or no difference between 
conditions across time. (See Fig. 1. for details of plots and plotting conventions.) (See also

 Figure 3. Reduced neural adaptation in dyslexia when viewing repeated text
(A) Schematic of the stimulation paradigm. (B) The control group exhibited significant 
adaptation in classical reading areas in the left hemisphere: FusG, pSTG, and IFG. (C) The 
dyslexia group showed significant adaptation in IFG only, with weaker and non-significant 
adaptation in FusG. (D) Adaptation in the dyslexia group was significantly reduced 
throughout posterior reading areas, including pSTG, SMG, pMTG, and FusG. (E–F) In 
FusG, the control group exhibited a consistently greater adaptation across time than the 
dyslexia group, and tended to show greater overall response to text (although this difference 
was not significant: Fig. S3C,D). (G,H) The control group showed a modest trend towards 
adaptation in left pMTG, whereas the dyslexia group showed a greater trend toward 
enhancement (greater response to the Adapt than No-Adapt condition). (See Fig. 1. for 
details of plots and plotting conventions.) (See also Figure S2C,D and Table S4.)

 Figure 4. Reduced neural adaptation in dyslexia when viewing repeated objects
(A) Schematic of the stimulation paradigm. (B) The control group exhibited significant 
adaptation to repetition of photographs of objects throughout lateral inferior temporal-
occipital cortex (ITO). (C) Weaker adaptation was observed in the dyslexia group 
throughout the same areas, (D) which was significantly reduced compared to controls. (EH) 
The control group exhibited a consistently greater difference between conditions, with the 
magnitude of adaptation increasing across the stimulation period, whereas the dyslexia 
group showed significant adaptation, albeit at a consistently lower magnitude than controls.

adaptation throughout the same areas. (D) Adaptation in the dyslexia group was significantly 
reduced throughout face-sensitive cortex, including prominently in FusG. (E–H) The control 
group exhibited modest but overall significant adaptation to repetition of faces, with the 
magnitude of adaptation increasing across the stimulation period; the dyslexia group also 
showed significant adaptation, but at a significantly lower magnitude than controls. (See Fig.

 Figure 6. Reduced neural adaptation in dyslexia to faces in FFA
Individuals with dyslexia exhibited reduced adaptation to repeated vs. unrepeated faces, even 
when adaptation was measured in individually-localized face-selective cortex. (A) 
Probabilistic location of the fusiform face area (FFA) across all participants; greater 
response to faces than objects in ventral temporal cortices was used to localize face-selective 
clusters in individual participants from Experiments 2c and 2d. (B) Barplots: magnitude of 
neural response (activation) by condition (“No-Adapt”: N-A, blue; “Adapt”: A, red) and 
group (controls: lighter bars; dyslexia: darker bars) in FFA. The No-Adapt > Adapt contrast 
was significant in the control group (*** p < 0.00002), but not in dyslexia (n.s., p = 0.11). 
Boxplots: difference between conditions (adaptation) in FFA by group. The difference in 
adaptation between the two groups was also significant (Group × Condition interaction, ** p 
< 0.002). (C) Mean time course (solid lines) ± s.e.m. of BOLD responses to the No-Adapt 
and Adapt conditions by group, and their difference (adaptation), in FFA. (All plotting
