BACKGROUND
Nivolumab has been associated with longer overall survival than docetaxel among pa-
tients with previously treated non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In an open-label 
phase 3 trial, we compared first-line nivolumab with chemotherapy in patients with 
programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1)–positive NSCLC.
METHODS
We randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, patients with untreated stage IV or recurrent 
NSCLC and a PD-L1 tumor-expression level of 1% or more to receive nivolumab (admin-
istered intravenously at a dose of 3 mg per kilogram of body weight once every 2 weeks) 
or platinum-based chemotherapy (administered once every 3 weeks for up to six cycles). 
Patients receiving chemotherapy could cross over to receive nivolumab at the time of 
disease progression. The primary end point was progression-free survival, as assessed 
by means of blinded independent central review, among patients with a PD-L1 expres-
sion level of 5% or more.
RESULTS
Among the 423 patients with a PD-L1 expression level of 5% or more, the median pro-
gression-free survival was 4.2 months with nivolumab versus 5.9 months with chemo-
therapy (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 1.15; 95% confidence interval 
[CI], 0.91 to 1.45; P 
= 
0.25), and the median overall survival was 14.4 months versus 13.2 
months (hazard ratio for death, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.80 to 1.30). A total of 128 of 212 patients 
(60%) in the chemotherapy group received nivolumab as subsequent therapy. Treatment-
related adverse events of any grade occurred in 71% of the patients who received 
nivolumab and in 92% of those who received chemotherapy. Treatment-related adverse 
events of grade 3 or 4 occurred in 18% of the patients who received nivolumab and in 
51% of those who received chemotherapy.
CONCLUSIONS
Nivolumab was not associated with significantly longer progression-free survival than 
chemotherapy among patients with previously untreated stage IV or recurrent NSCLC 
with a PD-L1 expression level of 5% or more. Overall survival was similar between 
groups. Nivolumab had a favorable safety profile, as compared with chemotherapy, with 
no new or unexpected safety signals. (Funded by Bristol-Myers Squibb and others;

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
F
or the past two decades, platinum-
based combination chemotherapy has been 
the standard-of-care, first-line treatment for 
patients with advanced non–small-cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC) without mutations that were 
sensitive to targeted therapy.1,2 However, chemo-
therapy has provided only a moderate benefit, 
with a limited safety profile. In phase 3 clinical 
trials, the median progression-free survival with 
platinum-based chemotherapy was 4 to 6 months, 
and the median overall survival was 10 to 13 
months.3-8
In two phase 3 trials, nivolumab, a pro-
grammed death 1 (PD-1) immune-checkpoint–
inhibitor antibody, resulted in significantly longer 
overall survival than docetaxel among patients 
with metastatic NSCLC who had disease pro-
gression during or after platinum-based chemo-
therapy.9-11 Benefit was seen regardless of the 
PD-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression level but was 
enhanced in patients with nonsquamous NSCLC 
with increasing PD-L1 expression.9,10
In a multicohort phase 1 study involving pre-
viously untreated patients with NSCLC (Check-
Mate 012),12 preliminary data from a cohort of 
20 patients who received nivolumab monother-
apy showed durable responses and a favorable 
safety profile. Among the 10 patients with a 
PD-L1 expression level of 5% or more, the objec-
tive response rate was 50%, the rate of progres-
sion-free survival at 24 weeks was 70%, and the 
median progression-free survival was 10.6 months.13 
Although an increasing PD-L1 expression level was 
associated with greater benefit in the expanded 
cohort, clinical activity was also seen in patients 
with a low PD-L1 expression level or with no PD-L1 
expression.12 On the basis of this preliminary 
data set and the finding that approximately 12 to 
15% of the patients had a PD-L1 result showing 
expression between 1% and 4% across studies of 
nivolumab involving patients with NSCLC (Bristol-
Myers Squibb, data on file), progression-free 
survival among patients with a PD-L1 expression 
level of 5% or more was chosen as the primary 
end point because this population was thought 
to be more likely to show a progression-free 
survival benefit with nivolumab than patients 
with a lower (<5%) PD-L1 expression level.
Owing to the complexity of the immune sys-
tem, biomarkers for response to immuno-onco-
logic agents beyond PD-L1 expression levels are 
being explored. Early data support the hypothe-
sis that a high tumor-mutation burden may in-
crease the likelihood of benefit from immuno-
therapy, because a high tumor-mutation burden 
may enhance tumor immunogenicity by increas-
ing the number of neoantigens, which are recog-
nized by T cells as nonself, leading to an anti-
tumor immune response.14
We report the results of an international, ran-
domized, open-label, phase 3 trial (CheckMate 
026) that compared the efficacy and safety of 
nivolumab with those of platinum-based chemo-
therapy as first-line therapy in patients with 
stage IV or recurrent NSCLC with a PD-L1 ex-
pression level of 5% or more (primary efficacy 
analysis population) and those with a PD-L1 
expression level of 1% or more (secondary effi-
cacy analysis population). Furthermore, we report 
an exploratory analysis to assess the effects of the 
tumor-mutation burden on treatment outcomes.
Methods
Patients
Eligible adult patients had histologically con-
firmed squamous-cell or nonsquamous stage IV 
or recurrent NSCLC, an Eastern Cooperative On-
cology Group (ECOG) performance-status score 
of 0 or 1 (on a 5-point scale, with higher num-
bers indicating greater disability), and measur-
able disease according to the Response Evalua-
tion Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 
1.1,15 and had received no previous systemic anti-
cancer therapy as primary therapy for advanced 
or metastatic disease. Patients with central ner-
vous system metastases were eligible if they had 
been adequately treated and had been asymp-
tomatic for at least 2 weeks before randomization. 
Eligible patients had to not be taking glucocorti-
coids or had to be taking a stable or decreasing 
dose of 10 mg or less of prednisone daily (or its 
equivalent). Previous palliative radiotherapy, if 
completed at least 2 weeks before randomization, 
and previous adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemo-
therapy that was completed at least 6 months 
before enrollment were permitted. Patients with 
an autoimmune disease or known EGFR muta-
tions or ALK translocations that were sensitive to 
available targeted therapy were excluded.
Fresh or archival tumor-biopsy specimens ob-
tained within 6 months before enrollment were 
tested for PD-L1 by a centralized laboratory with 
the use of the anti–PD-L1 antibody (28-8 anti-
body).9,10 Only patients with a PD-L1 expression 
level of 1% or more underwent randomization.

Nivolumab in Stage IV or Recurrent NSCLC
Written informed consent was provided by all 
the patients before enrollment.
Trial Design and Treatment
Patients were enrolled from March 2014 through 
April 2015. Eligible patients were randomly as-
signed in a 1:1 ratio to receive nivolumab (at a 
dose of 3 mg per kilogram of body weight every 
2 weeks) or the investigator’s choice of platinum 
doublet chemotherapy (every 3 weeks for four to 
six cycles) (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appen-
dix, available with the full text of this article at 
NEJM.org). Chemotherapy was continued until 
disease progression, the occurrence of an unac-
ceptable level of toxic effects, or the completion 
of permitted cycles. Maintenance therapy with 
pemetrexed was allowed in patients with non-
squamous NSCLC who had stable disease or a 
response after cycle 4. Treatment with nivolumab 
beyond progression was permitted if protocol-
defined criteria were met, including investigator-
assessed clinical benefit, no rapid disease pro-
gression, no unacceptable level of adverse events 
related to nivolumab, and a stable performance 
status, and if there was no interference with im-
minent intervention to prevent serious complica-
tions of disease progression. Concomitant sys-
temic glucocorticoid treatment (courses lasting 
<3 weeks) was allowed for nonautoimmune 
conditions, including but not limited to treatment-
related adverse events with a potential immuno-
logic cause.
Randomization was stratified according to 
PD-L1 expression level (<5% vs. ≥5%) and tumor 
histologic findings (squamous vs. nonsquamous). 
Patients in the chemotherapy group who had 
disease progression according to RECIST, as as-
sessed by the investigator and confirmed by an 
independent radiologist, could cross over to re-
ceive nivolumab, provided that eligibility criteria 
were met. For patients in the chemotherapy 
group, dose delays and two or fewer dose reduc-
tions because of toxic effects were allowed. For 
patients in the nivolumab group, dose delays 
because of toxic effects were allowed, but dose 
reductions were not allowed.
End Points and Assessments
The primary end point was progression-free sur-
vival, as assessed by blinded independent central 
review, among patients with a PD-L1 expression 
level of 5% or more. Secondary end points in-
cluded progression-free survival, as assessed by 
means of blinded independent central review, 
among all the patients who had undergone ran-
domization (of whom all had a PD-L1 expression 
level of ≥1%), overall survival among patients 
with a PD-L1 expression level of 5% or more and 
among all the patients who had undergone ran-
domization, and the independently assessed re-
sponse rate among patients with a PD-L1 expres-
sion level of 5% or more.
Tumor response was assessed every 6 weeks 
until week 48 and every 12 weeks thereafter. 
Safety assessments included the recording of ad-
verse events, which were graded according to the 
National Cancer Institute Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0. The inves-
tigators determined whether an adverse event was 
related to a trial drug.
Exploratory Biomarker Analysis of Tumor-
Mutation Burden
The tumor-mutation burden, which was defined 
as the total number of somatic missense muta-
tions present in a baseline tumor sample, was 
determined in patients with tumor and blood 
samples sufficient for whole-exome sequencing. 
For efficacy analyses, patients were grouped in 
thirds according to tumor-mutation burden. The 
boundaries for these three groups were a tumor-
mutation burden of 0 to less than 100 mutations 
(low burden), 100 to 242 mutations (medium 
burden), and 243 or more mutations (high burden). 
All the testing and analyses of tumor-mutation 
burden were exploratory and not prespecified, 
including the evaluation according to distribu-
tion into the three groups. The testing was con-
ducted in a research laboratory, and the methodo-
logic approach that we used has not been 
approved by the Clinical Laboratory Improve-
ment Amendments program as a clinical diag-
nostic test. Details are provided in the Supple-
mentary Appendix.
Trial Oversight
The trial was designed and data were analyzed 
jointly by the sponsor (Bristol-Myers Squibb) and 
a steering committee, with the participation of 
individual authors. All the investigators collected 
data. The trial protocol, available at NEJM.org, 
was approved by the institutional review board 
or independent ethics committee at each center. 
The trial was conducted in accordance with the

lines on Good Clinical Practice and the Declara-

monitoring committee provided oversight of safe-
ty and efficacy. This report is based on the final 
data analysis (database locked on August 2, 2016).
All the authors attest that the trial was con-
ducted in accordance with the protocol and 
vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the

fidentiality agreement with the sponsor. Medi-
cal writing support, including writing of the 
first draft of the manuscript, was provided by 
Evidence Scientific Solutions, with funding from 
the sponsor.
Statistical Analysis
The sample-size estimation for the primary effi-
cacy analysis population (patients with a PD-L1 
expression level of ≥5%) was based on an expected 
median progression-free survival of 7 months in 
the chemotherapy group and an overall hazard 
ratio for disease progression or death of 0.71 
favoring nivolumab. We estimated that a sample 
of approximately 415 patients would provide the 
trial with 80% power to detect a difference in 
treatment effect on the primary end point with 
the use of a log-rank test with a two-sided sig-
nificance level of 5% after a minimum follow-up 
of approximately 18 months in patients with no 
disease progression or death.
The between-group comparisons of progres-
sion-free survival and overall survival were per-
formed by means of two-sided log-rank tests 
stratified according to PD-L1 expression level 
(<5% vs. ≥5%, for end points in all the patients 
who had undergone randomization) and tumor 
histologic findings. We used a stratified Cox 
proportional-hazards model that included the 
randomized treatment group as a single covariate 
to estimate hazard ratios and their associated 
95% confidence intervals. The Kaplan–Meier 
method was used to estimate survival curves. 
Response rates were compared between treat-
ment groups with the use of a two-sided, strati-
fied Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel test. The Clopper–
Pearson method was used to estimate response 
rates and their exact 95% confidence intervals.
Results
Patients and Treatment
Of 1325 patients enrolled in the trial, 541 (41%) 
underwent randomization, with 271 assigned to 
receive nivolumab and 270 assigned to receive 
chemotherapy. A total of 784 patients (59%) did 
not undergo randomization because their PD-L1 
samples could not be evaluated (6% of patients), 
because the PD-L1 expression level was less than 
1% (23%), or because they did not meet other 
trial criteria (30%). During screening, 746 of 
1047 patients (71%) who had PD-L1 results that 
could be evaluated had a PD-L1 expression of 1% 
or more. Overall, 530 patients (98% of all the 
patients who had undergone randomization) re-
ceived treatment (Fig. S1A and Table S1 in the 
Supplementary Appendix).
The primary efficacy analysis population (423 
patients with a PD-L1 expression level of ≥5%) 
constituted 78% of all the patients who had un-
dergone randomization. The median time from 
diagnosis to randomization of all the patients 
was 1.9 months (range, 0.3 to 214.9) in the 
nivolumab group and 2.0 months (range, 0.5 to 
107.3) in the chemotherapy group, with 76% and 
72% of patients, respectively, being assigned 
to the corresponding treatment groups within 
3 months after diagnosis. Overall, 39% of the 
patients had received radiotherapy previously.
The baseline characteristics of all the patients 
who underwent randomization were similar to 
those of the patients who were included in the 
primary efficacy analysis (Table 1, and Tables S2 
and S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). Among 
all the patients, the baseline characteristics were 
generally balanced between the treatment groups. 
However, in the nivolumab group, the percent-
age of women was lower than that in the chemo-
therapy group (32% vs. 45%), as was the percent-
age of patients with a PD-L1 expression level of 
50% or more (32% vs. 47%); the percentage of 
patients with liver metastases was slightly higher 
in the nivolumab group (20% vs. 13%). In ad-
dition, patients in the nivolumab group had a 
greater tumor burden (on the basis of the median 
sum of target-lesion diameters) than those in the 
chemotherapy group (Table 1).
The minimum follow-up for overall survival 
was 13.7 months, and the median follow-up was 
13.5 months (the minimum follow-up was com-
puted as the time from randomization of the last 
patient to the database lock, and the median 
follow-up was computed for all the patients 
from randomization to the last known vital-
status date). The median duration of therapy was 
3.7 months (range, 0.0 to 26.9+ [the plus sign

Efficacy
Primary Efficacy Analysis Population and All Patients
In the primary efficacy analysis population (pa-
tients with a PD-L1 expression level of ≥5%), 
there was no significant difference in progression-
free survival between treatment groups (Fig. 1A). 
The median progression-free survival was 4.2 
months (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.0 to 5.6) 
in the nivolumab group and 5.9 months (95% CI, 
5.4 to 6.9) in the chemotherapy group (hazard 
ratio for disease progression or death, 1.15; 95% 
CI, 0.91 to 1.45; P 
= 
0.25). The median overall 
survival in the primary efficacy analysis popula-
tion was 14.4 months (95% CI, 11.7 to 17.4) in 
the nivolumab group and 13.2 months (95% CI, 
10.7 to 17.1) in the chemotherapy group (hazard 
ratio for death, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.80 to 1.30) 
(Fig. 1B). Similar results regarding progression-
free survival and overall survival were found in 
the analyses that included all the patients who 
had undergone randomization (Figs. S2 and S3 
in the Supplementary Appendix).
The response rate among patients with a PD-L1 
expression level of 5% or more was 26% in the 
nivolumab group and 33% in the chemotherapy 
group (Table 2). The nivolumab group had a 
higher percentage of patients than the chemo-
therapy group with a best response of progres-
sive disease (27% vs. 10%). The median time to

Nivolumab in Stage IV or Recurrent NSCLC
response was similar in the nivolumab group 
and the chemotherapy group (2.8 months and 
2.6 months, respectively), whereas the median 
duration of response was more than twice as 
long with nivolumab as with chemotherapy (12.1 
vs. 5.7 months) (Table 2).
Selected Subgroups
Across most planned subgroups (which included 
all the patients who had undergone randomiza-
tion), the results of the analyses of progression-
free survival and overall survival were consistent 
with the overall trial results (Fig. 2A and 2B). 
The only prespecified subgroup was patients de-
fined according to histologic findings (a strati-
fication factor); patients with histologic results 
showing squamous-cell NSCLC had slightly lon-
ger progression-free survival and overall survival 
with nivolumab than with chemotherapy, although 
the results were not significant (Fig. 2A and 2B).
In the exploratory subgroup analysis involving 
patients with a PD-L1 expression level of 50% or 
more, the hazard ratio for disease progression 
or death was 1.07 (95% CI, 0.77 to 1.49), and the 
hazard ratio for death was 0.90 (95% CI, 0.63 to 
1.29). In this subgroup, the response rate was 
34% (95% CI, 24 to 45) in the nivolumab group 
and 39% (95% CI, 30 to 48) in the chemotherapy 
group. Because patients were not stratified ac-
cording to whether they had a PD-L1 expression 
level of 50% or more, the nivolumab group had 
fewer patients than the chemotherapy group (88 
vs. 126), and the imbalance in sex that was 
noted in the overall population (32% of the pa-
tients in the nivolumab group vs. 45% in the 
chemotherapy group were women) was even more 
pronounced in this subgroup (25% of the pa-
tients in the nivolumab subgroup vs. 44% in the 
chemotherapy subgroup were women). The cor-
responding findings for the subgroups of the 
primary efficacy analysis population are provid-
ed in Figure S4 in the Supplementary Appendix.
An exploratory analysis was conducted in 312 
patients (58% of the patients who had under-
gone randomization) to assess the effect of the 
tumor-mutation burden on outcomes (Fig. 2C 
and 2D). The percentage of patients with a high 
tumor-mutation burden was imbalanced between 
the treatment groups (30% in the nivolumab 
group vs. 39% in the chemotherapy group). The 
characteristics at baseline and the results re-
garding progression-free survival and overall sur-
vival were generally consistent with those in the 
total population. Details are provided in Tables 
S6, S7, and S8 and in Figures S5 through S14 in 
the Supplementary Appendix.
Among the patients with a high tumor-muta-
tion burden, the response rate was higher in the 
nivolumab group than in the chemotherapy group 
(47% vs. 28%), and progression-free survival was 
longer (median, 9.7 vs. 5.8 months; hazard ratio 
for disease progression or death, 0.62; 95% CI, 
0.38 to 1.00) (Fig. 2C). Overall survival was 
similar between groups regardless of the tumor-
mutation burden. However, 68% of the patients

Objective response was assessed according to the Response Evaluation 
Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1, by independent central review. The 95% 
confidence interval is based on the Clopper–Pearson method. The analysis 
was stratified according to tumor histologic findings. The strata‑adjusted odds 
ratio was calculated with the use of the Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel method.
‡  
The analysis was performed with data from all the patients who had a response 
(55 patients in the nivolumab group and 71 in the chemotherapy group).
§  
The time to response was defined as the time from randomization to the date 
of the first documented complete or partial response.
¶  
Results were calculated with the use of the Kaplan–Meier method. The dura‑
tion of response was defined as the time between the date of the first response 
and the date of the first documented event of progression, death, or last tumor 
assessment that was evaluated before subsequent therapy (data‑censoring 
date). The plus sign indicates that the response was ongoing at the time of 
data analysis; ongoing responses are censored at the date of the most recent 
scan obtained before the data analysis.

Nivolumab in Stage IV or Recurrent NSCLC
with a high tumor-mutation burden in the che-
motherapy group received subsequent nivolumab 
because of treatment crossover, access to nivolu-
mab after the trial, or both. There was no signifi-
cant association between tumor-mutation burden 
and PD-L1 expression level (Pearson’s correlation 
coefficient 
= 
0.059). However, in the nivolumab 
group, patients with both a high tumor-muta-
tion burden and a PD-L1 expression level of 50% 
or more had a higher response rate (75%) than 
those with only one of these factors (32% among 
patients with a high tumor-mutation burden 
only and 34% among those with a PD-L1 expres-
sion level of ≥50% only) or neither factor (16%). 
However, this comparison was not powered for 
statistical analysis. Details are provided in Fig-
ures S8, S9, S12, S13, and S14 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix.
Safety
Treatment-related adverse events of any grade oc-
curred in 71% of the patients treated with 
nivolumab and in 92% of those treated with che-
motherapy. The percentage of patients with treat-
ment-related adverse events of grade 3 or 4 was 
lower with nivolumab than with chemotherapy 
(18% vs. 51%) (Table 3, and Table S9 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). The rates of treatment-
related serious adverse events were similar in the 
two groups. Treatment-related adverse events 
leading to discontinuation of the study drug 
were 10% with nivolumab and 13% with chemo-
therapy (Table 3, and Tables S10, S11, and S12 in 
the Supplementary Appendix). The most common 
selected adverse events (those with a potential 
immunologic cause) that were adjudicated as be-
ing related to treatment were skin-related events 
in the nivolumab group and gastrointestinal 
events in the chemotherapy group (Table S13 in 
the Supplementary Appendix).
Five deaths were attributed to study treatment. 
There were two deaths in the nivolumab group 
(one each from multiorgan failure and pneumo-
nitis) and three in the chemotherapy group (one 
from sepsis and two from febrile neutropenia).
Discussion
In the primary efficacy population in this trial 
involving patients with stage IV or recurrent 
NSCLC and a PD-L1 expression level of 5% or 
more, patients who received first-line mono-
therapy with nivolumab did not have longer 
progression-free survival than those who received 
chemotherapy. Overall survival was similar in 
the two treatment groups, comparing favorably 
with historical controls of first-line platinum-
based chemotherapy.3-8 Given that nivolumab ther-
apy prolongs survival among previously treated 
patients with advanced NSCLC,9,10 the high fre-
quency of subsequent nivolumab treatment may 
have contributed to the favorable overall survival 
in the chemotherapy group. In addition, imbal-
ances in the characteristics of the patients at 
baseline may have favored the chemotherapy 
group, including disease characteristics that are 
associated with a better prognosis (i.e., slightly 
fewer liver metastases, smaller tumor burden, 
and a higher proportion of women). Two factors 
that appear in retrospect to have had an influ-
ence on the response to nivolumab (i.e., a PD-L1 
expression level of ≥50% and a high tumor-
mutation burden) also disfavored the nivolumab 
group, which had lower proportions of such 
patients than did the chemotherapy group.3,4,16
Two additional observations worth noting are 
the high percentage of patients in this trial who 
had received radiotherapy previously (39%) and 
the median time from diagnosis to randomiza-
tion of approximately 2 months. Both these re-
sults may be attributed in part to the patients 
with recurrent disease who enrolled in this trial 
or to protocol criteria that allowed previous pal-
liative radiotherapy up to 2 weeks before random-
ization, with further language encouraging pa-
tients with symptomatic tumor lesions to receive 
this therapy before randomization. This approach

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
may have selected for a population of patients 
who had a poorer prognosis because of a high 
tumor burden and advanced disease; however, 
the results in the chemotherapy group with re-
gard to response rate and progression-free sur-
vival do not support this interpretation.
The KEYNOTE-024 trial17 established a role for 
the anti–PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab versus 
chemotherapy as first-line treatment in patients 
with NSCLC with a PD-L1 expression level of 
50% or more as determined by means of the 
Dako 22C3 PD-L1 test in a prospectively designed 
trial. The median progression-free survival was 
10.3 months in the pembrolizumab group and 
6.0 months in the chemotherapy group. The re-
sponse rate was 45% in the pembrolizumab 
group and 28% in the chemotherapy group.
Analyses comparing treatment efficacy in 
patients with a PD-L1 expression level of 50% or 
more were not prespecified in CheckMate 026, 
and the two groups had an imbalance in the 
number of patients (88 vs. 126), thereby limiting 
the conclusions that can be drawn in this sub-
group. By contrast, the KEYNOTE-024 trial pro-
spectively assessed the activity of pembrolizumab 
versus chemotherapy in patients who had ad-
vanced NSCLC with a PD-L1 expression level of 
at least 50% and who had not received chemo-
therapy previously.17 Other differences between 
the trials have been outlined in a recent review 
article.18 Examples include the different assays to 
assess PD-L1 tumor expression, the criteria relat-
ed to previous radiotherapy and glucocorticoid use 
during the trials, and imbalances between groups 
in the characteristics of the patients (e.g., sex in 
CheckMate 026 and the lower percentage of pa-
tients who had never smoked in the immunother-
apy group in KEYNOTE-024 [3%] than in Check-
Mate 026 [11%]).17,18 Although the precise reasons

Data are based on an August 2, 2016, database lock. Safety analyses included all the patients who had received at least 
one dose of nivolumab or chemotherapy. Included are events that were reported in at least 10% of the patients in either 
trial group from the time of the first dose of nivolumab or chemotherapy to 30 days after the receipt of the last dose or to 
the time of the first dose of nivolumab crossover, whichever came first. The relatedness of adverse events to treatment 
was adjudicated by the investigators.

Nivolumab in Stage IV or Recurrent NSCLC
trial and the CheckMate 026 trial remain unclear 
and cannot be attributed to a single factor, the 
differences outlined above may be contributing 
factors.
In an exploratory, hypothesis-generating analy-
sis, among patients with a high tumor-mutation 
burden, nivolumab was associated with a higher 
response rate than chemotherapy (47% vs. 28%) 
and with a longer median progression-free sur-
vival (9.7 vs. 5.8 months). No between-group 
difference was noted with regard to overall sur-
vival in the subgroup of patients with a high 
tumor-mutation burden, which may be explained 
in part by the high rate of subsequent nivolumab 
use (68% of patients) in the chemotherapy group. 
Nevertheless, the subgroup of patients with a 
high tumor-mutation burden in the nivolumab 
group had notable overall survival (median, >18 
months; overall survival rate at 1 year, 64%). The 
level of tumor-mutation burden and the level of 
tumor PD-L1 expression did not appear to be 
associated; however, information about the tumor-
mutation burden in patients with a PD-L1 ex-
pression level of less than 1% was not available, 
because such patients were not enrolled in this 
trial. These data are consistent with previous re-
ports suggesting no association between tumor-
mutation burden and PD-L1 expression in patients 
treated with pembrolizumab and only a weak 
association between tumor-mutation burden and 
PD-L1 expression in those treated with atezolizu-
mab.19,20 Patients with both a high tumor-muta-
tion burden and a PD-L1 expression level of 50% 
or more may have a greater likelihood of re-
sponse to nivolumab than those with only one 
or neither of these factors. Overall, the current 
findings are consistent with the hypothesis that 
immunotherapy may have enhanced activity in 
patients with a high tumor-mutation burden.14 
However, because this was an exploratory analy-
sis that was not prespecified, the data are hypoth-
esis-generating and require further prospective 
validation.
In conclusion, nivolumab monotherapy did not 
result in longer progression-free survival than 
platinum-based chemotherapy as first-line treat-
ment for stage IV or recurrent NSCLC in a broad 
population of patients with a PD-L1 expression 
level of 5% or more. Overall survival with single-
agent nivolumab was similar to overall survival 
with platinum doublet chemotherapy. Nivolumab 
had a favorable safety profile as compared with 
chemotherapy, and no new safety signals were 
observed.
