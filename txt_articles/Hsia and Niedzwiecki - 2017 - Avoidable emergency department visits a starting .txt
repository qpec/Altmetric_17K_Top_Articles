Abstract
Objective: To better characterize and understand the nature of a very conservative definition of
‘avoidable’ emergency department (ED) visits in the United States to provide policymakers insight
into what interventions can target non-urgent ED visits.
Design/setting: We performed a retrospective analysis of a very conservative definition of ‘avoidable’
ED visits using data from the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey from 2005 to 2011.
Participants: We examined a total of 115 081 records, representing 424 million ED visits made by
patients aged 18–64 years who were seen in the ED and discharged home.
Main outcome measures: We defined ‘avoidable’ as ED visits that did not require any diagnostic
or screening services, procedures or medications, and were discharged home.
Results: In total, 3.3% (95% CI: 3.0–3.7) of all ED visits were ‘avoidable.’ The top five chief com-
plaints included toothache, back pain, headache, other symptoms/problems related to psychosis
and throat soreness. Alcohol abuse, dental disorders and depressive disorders were among the
top three ICD-9 discharge diagnoses. Alcohol-related disorders and mood disorders accounted for
6.8% (95% CI: 5.7–8.0) of avoidable visits, and dental disorders accounted for 3.9% (95% CI:
3.0–4.8) of CCS-grouped discharge diagnoses.
Conclusions: A significant number of ‘avoidable’ ED visits were for mental health and dental con-
ditions, which the ED is not fully equipped to treat. Our findings provide a better understanding of
what policy initiatives could potentially reduce these ‘avoidable’ ED visits to address the gaps in
our healthcare system, such as increased access to mental health and dental care.
Key words: health policy, healthcare system, emergency care, setting of care, avoidable, non-urgent, emergency department
Introduction
The rhetoric surrounding ‘avoidable’ emergency department (ED)
visits in the United States has been contentious. Since the Deficit
Reduction Act of 2005, states may impose mandatory cost-sharing
for non-urgent ED visits for Medicaid patients. Most recently,
Indiana set copayments for ‘non-emergency care’ delivered in the
ED as part of its Medicaid expansion waiver in 2015. Health plans,
too, have emphasized the importance of avoiding the ED to reduce
costs. Estimates of ‘avoidable’ ED visits run as low as 4.8% [1] and
as high as 90% [2], and come from various methodologies to deter-
mine what constitutes a necessary versus unnecessary ED visit.
Defining what is ‘non-urgent’, ‘unnecessary’ or ‘inappropriate’, is
perhaps the first problem, as these terms are often conflated due to
the lack of a consensus for a standard definition of a non-urgent vis-
it and the complex nature of its categorization [3–5].

 Current literature use retrospective diagnoses [3, 5], hospital
admissions [2], triage scores [3] and patient self-reported data [6],
among others, to define ‘avoidable’. However, using chief com-
plaints derived from diagnoses, which are determined post hoc, can be
dangerous because visits that are eventually determined to be non-
emergent after physician examination and diagnostic testing are virtu-
ally indistinguishable from emergent visits [7]. Additionally, triage
scores, while correlated with the true severity of disease, are notori-
ously poor predictors [3, 8].
Because of these difficulties, creating broad policy initiatives to
deter potentially avoidable visits could be risky. However, even
advocates against restricting ED access for non-urgent visits admit
that a sub-population of ED patients can be better treated elsewhere
at lower costs. To address this issue, we sought to present a charac-
terization of a very restrictive definition of ‘avoidable’ ED visits,
creating a baseline for which many practitioners would agree poten-
tially would not warrant an ED visit, and providing insight as to
why these patients present to the ED and some direction for policy-
makers to better target interventions in the US.
Methods
Our retrospective analysis used the National Hospital Ambulatory
Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) for years 2005–2011. NHAMCS is a
national sample survey conducted by the National Center for Health
Statistics and represents 136 million visits in the US annually [9],
providing information on ED visits to non-federal, general and
acute care hospitals in the United States. We examined visits by
patients aged 18–64 years, the population affected by the current and
potential Medicaid cost-sharing increases, seen and discharged from
the ED to characterize and determine the proportion of non-urgent
visits, using our proposed definition of ‘avoidable’.
We conservatively defined ‘avoidable’ ED visits as discharged ED
visits not requiring any diagnostic tests, procedures or medications.
Diagnostic tests included imaging (x-rays, CT scans, MRI), blood tests
(CBC, BUN/creatinine, electrolytes) or other tests (cardiac monitor,
EKG/ECG, toxicology). Procedures included IV fluids, suturing/staples
and nebulizer therapy. Medications included over-the-counter
and prescription medications administered or prescribed.
We excluded patients admitted for observation, hospitalized,
transferred, died in the ED or were dead on arrival. Because
NHAMCS has been known to underreport diagnostic testing and
procedures, we excluded visits where any stated reason was coded
as diagnostic tests (3300–3399), other screening and preventive
procedures (3400–3499), medications (4100–4199), preoperative
and postoperative care (4200–4299), specific types of therapy
(4400–4499) or specific therapeutic procedures (4500–4599). We
also excluded visits where tests or procedures were blank/missing
and those that did not receive care, including patients who left
before triage, medical screening, or being seen, walked out, were
not seen by a physician, left against medical advice, were not
authorized to received treatment, were transferred to another facil-
ity, or saw another specialist. Overall, 115 081 records represent-
ing 424 million visits met our selection criteria.
We analyzed the primary International Classification of Disease,
Ninth Revision (ICD-9) discharge diagnosis and the Healthcare
Cost
and
Utilization
Project’s
(HCUP)
Clinical
Classification
Software (CCS) grouping of primary ICD-9 discharge diagnoses for
‘avoidable’ visits, as well as the rate of avoidable visits. The
University of California, San Francisco deemed this study exempt
from human subjects review.
Results
We found that 3.3% (95% CI: 3.0–3.7) of all ED visits met our def-
inition of ‘avoidable’ (Fig. 1). The average age of patients was 36,
with 52% female, 70% white, 25% black, 33% privately-insured,
28% uninsured, 22% Medicaid-insured and 8% Medicare-insured.
And 14% of these visits arrived by ambulance. The top five chief
complaints were toothache, back pain, headache, other symptoms/
problems related to psychosis and throat soreness. The top three
ICD-9 diagnoses of ‘avoidable’ visits included alcohol abuse, dental
disorders and depressive disorders.
When examining the diagnoses using HCUP’s CCS, we found
that alcohol-related and mood disorders (depression and anxiety)
accounted for 6.8% (95% CI: 5.7–8.0) of all ‘avoidable’ visits, and
disorders of the teeth and jaw accounted for 3.9% (95% CI:
3.0–4.8) (Table 1).
While the main analyses examined the proportion of total ED
visits that would be ‘avoidable’ by diagnosis grouping, we also
determined the percentages of each diagnosis grouping that met our
definition of ‘avoidable’. We found that 10.4% (95% CI: 7.7–13.1)
of visits diagnosed with alcohol-related disorders, 16.9% (95% CI:
13.5–20.2) of mood disorders and 4.9% (95% CI: 3.9–6.0) of disor-
ders of the teeth and jaw met our criteria of ‘avoidable’.
Discussion
Our analysis using a very restrictive definition of ‘avoidable’ showed
that 3.3% of all ED visits in the US did not require any diagnostic
testing, procedures or medications. The 6.8% of these visits were for
alcohol-related and mood disorders and 3.9% for disorders related
to the teeth and jaw. We also found that alcohol-related and mood
disorders and disorders of the teeth and jaw had the highest percen-
tages of ‘avoidable’ visits. At the same time, the vast majority of vis-
its with alcohol-related and mood disorders and disorders of the
teeth and jaw were not deemed ‘avoidable’, and therefore, it would
be an incorrect assumption that all patients with these conditions
should be not seen in the ED.
While previous studies have examined the appropriateness of ED
use [2, 3], accurate classification of non-urgent visits has remained a
challenge. One study using triage scores estimated 10.1% of visits to
be ‘non-urgent’ [3], higher than our estimate of 3.3%. Ours is a
more conservative estimate, using a purposefully more restrictive

 definition of ‘avoidable’ by excluding visits that involved the use of
diagnostic tests, procedures and medications. International studies
evaluating non-urgent ED visits [10–13] found that a large propor-
tion of visits (ranging from 10 to 70%) could be more suitably trea-
ted in primary care settings. These studies all defined ‘non-urgent’
differently, which highlight the importance of having a very conser-
vative baseline definition to isolate a small cohort of ‘avoidable’ vis-
its that is likely more acceptable than using triage scores, self-report,
physician reports or discharge diagnoses. By using a very restrictive
definition and finding what could be just a proportion of truly
avoidable ED visits, potentially policy interventions could be
initiated on a small group of patients for which less harm is possible,
given that they required no imaging, diagnostics, procedures or
medications.
Our most striking finding is that a significant number of avoid-
able visits are for conditions the ED is not equipped to treat.
Emergency physicians are trained to treat life- and limb-threatening
emergencies, making it inefficient for patients with mental health,
substance abuse, or dental disorders to be treated in this setting.
One potential mechanism to more appropriately direct limited
healthcare resources could be to increase access to mental health
and dental care, which have traditionally been treated as separate
categories of healthcare. For example, of the 46 states in the US that
offer dental coverage for non-pregnant adult Medicaid enrollees, 28
provide coverage for preventive services and 18 provide emergency
services only [14]. Although providing dental coverage is a step
towards increasing access to dental care, less than half of dentists
treat any Medicaid-insured patients [15]. Mental health and sub-
stance abuse patients similarly face difficulty in gaining access to
healthcare due to insurance-imposed restrictions, and while the
Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008 has begun
to address these disparities, not all avoidable ED visits are related to
mental health, substance abuse or dental disorders, highlighting a
need for greater access to care.
Our study has several limitations. First, because NHAMCS does
not code some minor procedures, our definition conservatively

 overestimates the number of patients receiving no tests, proce-
dures or medications. Second, NHAMCS data is based on survey
responses from EDs in the sample, which can introduce potential
for error. However, NHAMCS thoroughly investigates and recon-
ciles any discrepancies. Finally, some literature shows underre-
porting of medications, which could apply to procedures or
diagnostic testing. As NHAMCS statisticians have stated, reported
excess are perhaps more accurate than underreports [12]. However,
even if our findings are an overestimate, it lends even more cre-
dence that a very small proportion of patients could be identified
as ‘avoidable’.
Our findings serve as a start to addressing gaps in the US health-
care system, rather than penalizing patients for lack of access, and
may be a better step to decreasing ‘avoidable’ ED visits.
