Telomere length (TL) predicts the onset of cellular senescence in
vitro but the diagnostic utility of TL measurement in clinical
settings is not fully known. We tested the value of TL measure-
ment by flow cytometry and FISH (flowFISH) in patients with
mutations in telomerase and telomere maintenance genes. TL had
a discrete and reproducible normal range with definable upper
and lower boundaries. While TL above the 50th age-adjusted per-
centile had a 100% negative predictive value for clinically relevant
mutations, the lower threshold in mutation carriers was age-
dependent, and adult mutation carriers often overlapped with
the lowest decile of controls. The extent of telomere shortening
correlated with the age at diagnosis as well as the short telomere
syndrome phenotype. Extremely short TL caused bone marrow
failure and immunodeficiency in children and young adults, while
milder defects manifested as pulmonary fibrosis-emphysema in
adults. We prospectively examined whether TL altered treatment de-
cisions for newly diagnosed idiopathic bone marrow failure patients
and found abnormally short TL enriched for patients with mutations
in some inherited bone marrow failure genes, such as RUNX1, in
addition to telomerase and telomere maintenance genes. The result
was actionable, altering the choice of treatment regimen and/or he-
matopoietic stem cell donor in one-fourth of the cases (9 of 38, 24%).
We conclude that TL measurement by flowFISH, when used for tar-
geted clinical indications and in limited settings, can influence treat-
ment decisions in ways that improve outcome.

W
hen primary human fibroblasts are grown in culture, they
have a finite replicative potential; it is predictable based
on the length of telomere repeat DNA (1). Telomeres define the
ends of chromosomes and function to preserve genome integrity;
they are comprised of TTAGGG sequences that are bound by
specialized proteins (2). Telomere length (TL) shortens during
DNA replication and, at a critical threshold, the shortest telomere(s)
activate a DNA damage response that signals cell death or a per-
manent cell cycle arrest, known as cellular senescence (3, 4). The
observations in cultured cells, and the fact that TL shortens with
aging, have led to a hypothesized role for telomere shortening in
human aging and age-related disease (1, 5); however, the short TL
threshold that is clinically relevant for disease risk is not known,
and whether TL measurement can influence treatment decisions
in clinical settings has not been determined.
The short telomere syndromes are a group of genetic disorders
that are caused by mutations in components of the telomerase en-
zyme and other telomere maintenance genes (6). They provide a
model for understanding the causal role of short telomeres in human
disease. Their manifestations include a heterogeneous spectrum of
pathologies that include primary immunodeficiency and bone mar-
row failure (7–9). The most common short telomere syndrome pa-
thologies are idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and related
interstitial lung disorders (10, 11). Severe emphysema, alone or
combined with fibrosis, may also manifest in short telomere pa-
tients who are smokers (12). Mutations in the essential telomerase
enzyme genes, TERT, the telomerase reverse transcriptase, and
TR, the telomerase RNA component (also known as TERC), are
the most common cause of IPF, and the frequency of TERT mu-
tations in severe, early-onset emphysema rivals the prevalence
of α-1 antitrypsin deficiency (12). The prevalence of telomerase
mutations in adult-onset lung disease makes the short telomere
syndromes the most-common premature aging disorders, with
an estimated 10,000 affected individuals in the United States
alone (13). Identifying these patients is critical for clinical man-
agement, as they are susceptible to life-threatening toxicities from
DNA damaging agents and other cytotoxic therapies (14–17). In
the hematopoietic stem cell transplant setting for bone marrow
failure in particular, reduced intensity regimens improve outcomes
of short telomere syndrome patients (14). However, the vast

This study defines clinical indications for using telomere length
(TL) measurement as a diagnostic tool in a hospital setting. It
shows that, in contrast to other methods, TL measurement by
flow cytometry and FISH (flowFISH) can be standardized, and
has reproducible and definable upper and lower normal bound-
aries. In telomerase mutation carriers and carriers of other mu-
tant telomere maintenance genes, TL had prognostic value,
correlating with the age of onset of short telomere syndrome
phenotypes, as well as the predominant complication. In a pro-
spective study, TL results were actionable in one-fourth of cases
with idiopathic bone marrow failure affecting the stem cell donor
choice and/or treatment regimen. The data show that, for
targeted clinical indications, and in a hospital setting, TL mea-
surement by flowFISH informs patient care decisions.

 majority of these patients lack recognizable clinical features at the
bedside, and there is often no notable family history at the time of
diagnosis (9, 18). There is therefore a clinical need for molecular
diagnostic tools for the evaluation of short telomere syndromes.
To identify an ideal method for TL measurement in clinical
settings, we considered such a method must be reproducible and
amenable to standardizing. One method that was developed for
epidemiologic studies measures TL by quantitative PCR; how-
ever, this method has shown a 20% variability rate across labo-
ratories (19, 20). The variability lies in part due to its sensitivity
to DNA quality and extraction methods, while also being prone
to error propagation with PCR amplification (21, 22). Circulat-
ing leukocytes additionally have variable TL depending on their
replicative histories (23), thus making the analysis of total leu-
kocyte TL, by quantitative PCR as well as by the Southern blotting
method, confounded by fluctuations in leukocyte ratios. Impor-
tantly, in contrast to other genotypes, TL is a continuous variable,
and the absence of standardized normal ranges and abnormal TL
thresholds presents an impediment to translating research findings
to clinical settings. Here, we report a hospital-based experience of
TL testing by automated flow cytometry and FISH (flowFISH)
(24). This method was developed to measure single-cell TL using a
fluorescently labeled probe that hybridizes to telomere DNA (24).
We show that peripheral blood TL measurement by flowFISH is a
gold standard for clinical use; it informs diagnostic and patient
care decisions in clinical settings.
Results
TL Has a Discrete and Reproducible Normal Range in the Human
Population. To test the relevance of TL measurement for patient
care decisions, we first sought to establish a normal range based
on values obtained from 192 controls we recruited across the age
spectrum at The Johns Hopkins Hospital (Table S1). TL short-
ened with age in lymphocytes and showed a normal distribution
at every age, similar to prior reports (11, 23) (Fig. 1A, Fig. S1A,
and Table S2). The reproducibility for TL measured by flow-
FISH was superior to quantitative PCR with an intra- and
interassay coefficient of variation (CV) of 2.2% and 2.5% for
lymphocytes, compared with 8.0% and 25.0%, respectively (Fig.
S1 B–D). We compared the interlaboratory reproducibility with a
Vancouver laboratory that uses flowFISH and found an
outstanding concordance (R2 0.94, slope 1.04, P < 0.0001, linear re-
gression) (Fig. 1B and Fig. S1 B and C). To test the generalizability
of this normal range, we compared the nomogram from the Bal-
timore population with data published from an ethnically different
population of 444 controls recruited in Vancouver (23), and found
they were nearly identical in both range and percentile distribu-
tions (Fig. 1A). The concordance was tighter for lymphocytes than
granulocytes, likely in part because of the known effects of freezing
on granulocyte TL (23) (Fig. S1 E and F). These data indicated
that TL, across different populations and as measured by flow-
FISH, has reproducible upper and lower boundaries.
There Is an Age-Dependent Short TL Threshold Associated with Disease
Risk. We next examined whether TL can be used to identify pa-
tients with germline defects in telomere maintenance. We recruited
100 individuals from 60 families who carried known pathogenic
mutations in telomerase and other telomere maintenance genes
(Table S3). These mutations, which were deemed pathogenic based
on segregation in families and functional molecular evidence, fell in
seven genes: TERT, TR, DKC1, RTEL1, PARN, TINF2, and NAF1
(Table S4). TERT mutations were most common, seen in 49 of the
cases. The mean age of mutation carriers was 41 y (range, 8 mo to
77 y) and 54% were male. None of these patients had TL above
the age-adjusted 50th percentile, indicating a 100% negative
predictive value for identifying a clinically meaningful mutation in
telomerase/telomere maintenance genes (Fig. 2A). We examined
whether there is a TL threshold, relative to controls, that helps to
identify telomerase and telomere maintenance gene-mutation
carriers, and found an age-dependent effect. Because the trends
we will report hereafter also hold for granulocytes, we summarized
the analyses for lymphocytes, and the respective granulocyte data
are shown in Fig. S2. There was no single short TL threshold that
encompassed all mutation carriers across the entire age spectrum.
This finding is in contrast to conclusions from a study that was
limited to a predominantly pediatric population (25). We found
that, whereas in children under the age of 20 y TL deviated sig-
nificantly from the age-adjusted median control length, adults over
the age of 60 y usually overlapped with the lowest decile of healthy
controls [mean deviation from age-adjusted median (ΔT) −4.4
vs. −1.6 kb, respectively, P < 0.0001, Mann–Whitney U test] (Fig. 2
A and B). In a similar analysis, 39 of 42 (93%) of patients who

 were identified before the age of 40 y had TL below the first
percentile, while only 9 of 58 (16%) diagnosed after 40 y fell in
that range (Fig. 2B). There was also a notable dropout of mutation
carriers who had TL below the first percentile after age of 60 y,
possibly reflecting attrition related to more severe telomere-
mediated pathology (Fig. 2 A and B). These data indicated
that TL testing has an outstanding negative predictive value for
excluding individuals with clinically relevant mutations across the
age spectrum; however, its highest sensitivity is in patients who
are younger than 40 y.

Alder et al.
 The Degree of Telomere Shortening Correlates with Disease Onset and
Type in Mutation Carriers. To assess if TL correlates with clinical
outcomes, we queried the phenotypes of these 100 mutation
carriers. We found a significant subset was asymptomatic (27%);
these patients had been identified because of a diagnosis in a
symptomatic relative. The extent of telomere shortening in these
asymptomatic individuals was similar to symptomatic patients
(mean ΔT −3.1 vs. −3.0, P = 0.7, Mann–Whitney U test), sug-
gesting the short telomere defect itself is not pathognomonic for
a disease state. However, in this cross-sectional analysis, we
noted that the proportion of symptomatic patients increased
with age: 10 of 21 (50%) who were younger than 20 y showed
symptoms compared with 15 of 17 (88%) above 60 y [P = 0.015,
Fisher’s exact test (Fig. 2D); odds ratio 8.3 (95% confidence
interval, 1.5–45.4)]. On average, symptomatic individuals were
13 y older than asymptomatic mutation carriers (mean 44.6 vs.
31.7 y, P = 0.006, Mann–Whitney U test) (Fig. 2D). There was no
significant correlation between TL and the mutant gene (Fig. 2E),
except for DKC1 mutation carriers (all male) who had shorter TL
relative to TERT and TR mutation carriers (Fig. 2E and Fig. S2B).
Notably, among these 100 mutation carriers, only 7, all who were
male, had any of the classic mucocutaneous features of dyskeratosis
congenita. These data underscore the importance of molecular di-
agnostic tools for identifying this population.
We next tested whether in the 73 symptomatic mutation carriers,
TL had predictive value. We focused on four common degenerative,
fatal complications, and noted several significant associations.
There was strong evidence for an age-dependent predilection as to
the predominant short telomere syndrome phenotype, as has been
hypothesized (18). Patients who developed bone marrow failure
first were on average three decades younger than pulmonary
fibrosis-emphysema patients with normal blood counts (mean
24.5 vs. 57.3 y, P < 0.001, Mann–Whitney U test) (Fig. 3A). There
was also a continuous correlation between the severity of the
telomere defect and the age at diagnosis as quantified by the ΔT in
lymphocytes (Fig. 3B and Fig. S2 C and D). Patients with more
severe telomere shortening manifested earlier in life, while pa-
tients with milder defects developed disease in adulthood (R2 0.59,
slope 13.2, 95% confidence interval 10.6–15.8). The correlation
between TL severity and disease onset resembled the causal re-
lationship seen between short telomeres and disease onset in mice
with short telomeres (26, 27). There was also a correlation be-
tween TL and disease complication. Patients with bone marrow
failure had significantly shorter age-adjusted TL than patients with
lung disease (mean ΔT −4.0 kb vs. −2.0 kb, P < 0.001, Mann–
Whitney U test) (Fig. 3C). In contrast, patients with liver disease
presented at an intermediate age (mean 40.6 y, range 15–52), and
had intermediate TL (mean ΔT −2.8 kb) relative to bone marrow
failure and pulmonary fibrosis patients (Fig. 3 A and C). Notably,
there was a demarcation of lung disease to adulthood, and we
found no cases of de novo pulmonary fibrosis (i.e., outside of the
posthematopoietic stem cell transplant setting) before the age of
35 y (41 of 41 cases) (Fig. 3A). These data have implications for
counseling and surveillance of patients with mutations in telomerase
and telomere maintenance genes.
TL Results Are Actionable for Bone Marrow Failure Patients. We
next examined whether TL can distinguish the etiology of
aplastic anemia, given the risk of morbidity with standard regimens
in patients with short telomere–mediated bone marrow failure. We
recruited 38 patients younger than the age of 40 y as this is the age
range when telomere-mediated aplastic anemia first manifests
(Table S5). The study was observational, with results disclosed to
the treating clinician in real time. Its endpoints were either a ge-
netic diagnosis or response to immunosuppression. In parallel, we
screened for the common inherited bone marrow failure genes
(details in Materials and Methods), and correlated the genetic data
with TL. Among 38 recruited patients, 22 reached an informative
endpoint with a documented response to immunosuppression (n =
10) or an identifiable genetic cause (n = 12) (Fig. 4A). All 10 patients
who were treated with immunosuppression and responded had
lymphocyte TL longer than the age-adjusted first percentile (Fig. 4
and Table S4). All of them had documented improvements in blood
counts (partial response n = 5, complete response n = 5) (Fig. 4). In
contrast, all of the patients with mutations in telomerase or telomere
maintenance genes had short TL below the first percentile (8 of 8),
with mutations identified in TERT, TR, DKC1, TINF2, and RTEL1
(Fig. 4). None of these eight patients had a family history or any
stigmata of a short telomere syndrome at the time of diagnosis,
underscoring the importance of TL as a diagnostic tool in this set-
ting. In addition, two other patients, with LIG4 and RUNX1 mu-
tations, also had TL shorter than the first percentile, suggesting
that this range may enrich for other inherited bone marrow failure
syndromes. The two patients we identified with GATA2 mutations
had lymphocyte TL in the range of immunoresponders. To test if
prior immunosuppression may affect TL in the diagnostic set-
ting, we studied aplastic anemia patients who were in remission
after treatment initiation (median 67 mo, range 14–180) (Table
S6). Similar to the de novo aplastic anemia patients who went
on to respond to immunosuppression, these retrospectively
studied patients (11 of 11, 100%) had TL above the first per-
centile (Fig. 4B). These data suggested that longer lymphocyte
TL enriches for immune-mediated forms of aplastic anemia and
distinguishes them from short telomere–mediated bone marrow
failure. We finally tracked whether TL results altered the man-
agement for the patients we recruited. In 9 of the 38 patients we
prospectively followed (24%); the short TL result was actionable.
It altered the treatment program by the primary clinician, in-
cluding in changing the choice of hematopoietic stem cell do-
nor through an evaluation of TL or genetic causes in relatives,
reducing the transplant preparative regimen intensity, or in
avoiding the use of empiric trials of immunosuppression therapy.
Discussion
Although telomere shortening has been associated in epidemiologic
studies with numerous conditions, its causal role in mediating disease
is most strongly linked to genetic disorders caused by mutations in
telomerase and other telomere maintenance genes. In this hospital-
based study, we found TL by flowFISH had outstanding inter-
laboratory reproducibility, superior to any other TL measurement
method heretofore tested. Importantly, we found the flowFISH-
derived normal TL range is definable and can be standardized.
Given the narrow normal range of TL in the human population
(Fig. 1A), our data indicate that flowFISH is a gold standard for
TL testing in patient care settings.
Our study focused on four degenerative disease presentations
that are most commonly associated with fatal complications, but
patients with mutations in telomerase and telomere maintenance
genes may also manifest with enteropathy, infertility, and cancer
(28–30). Short telomere syndrome patients have an increased
risk of myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia, as
well as squamous cell cancers (30); recognizing these patients has
similar implications and vigilance with cytotoxic treatments. TL
testing provides distinct information from DNA sequencing as it
can clarify the functional significance of DNA sequence variants.
The degree of TL deviation from the median is also predictive
and holds prognostic information as to the approximate timing of
disease onset and the predominant phenotype likely to develop.
Such findings make TL measurement critical for genetic coun-
seling and clinical symptom assessment in patients with patho-
genic mutations. The genetic basis of short telomere phenotypes
is still uncharacterized in approximately one-third to one-half of
cases, and TL testing may also be useful in recognizing some of
these patients.
Our data highlight the importance of integrating clinical and
genetic findings with TL in diagnostic settings because we did not

 find a threshold that encompassed all mutation carriers. In our study,
which included patients across the entire age spectrum, we found
that an arbitrary threshold (such as the first percentile) would miss
a subset of children with short telomere syndromes and nearly all
adult mutation carriers. While TL in this older age group has less
diagnostic specificity than in patients younger than 40 y, the neg-
ative predictive value remains outstanding and nearly all of these
patients fall below the 10th age-adjusted percentile. Moreover, the
severity of the short telomere defect within this group of patients
with predominantly pulmonary fibrosis may predict certain com-
plications. We also found that the first percentile threshold is not
specific to short telomere syndromes, and other inherited disorders
that cause bone marrow failure may be associated with very short
TL in leukocytes. The mechanisms are unknown, but the short TL
in these cases may reflect an acquired attrition related to increased
cell turnover, such as with the mutant transcription factor RUNX1,
or to the fact that mutant genes may possibly affect TL main-
tenance, such as with LIG4. Regardless, the biology and natural
history of these disorders are distinct from short telomere syn-
dromes even though the leukocyte TL may at times be short.

TL correlates with disease onset and disease type. (A) Dot plot shows age-dependent manifestations of the four common short telomere syndrome
features. IPF-E refers to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis with or without emphysema. BMF refers to bone marrow failure. PID refers to severe immunodeficiency,
presenting usually in the setting of enterocolitis in infants. The P values to the right indicate difference in age relative to IPF-emphysema (Mann–Whitney U
test). (B) Linear regression shows a correlation between deviation of lymphocyte TL from the age-adjusted median (ΔT) and the age at diagnosis of one of
four short telomere syndrome features. The linear regression line and 95% confidence intervals are shown for the 73 symptomatic individuals from A. (C) The
disease type correlates with ΔT with the percentile ranges, as shown below in the tabulated data. P values in C reflect ΔT comparisons relative to idiopathic
pulmonary fibrosis-emphysema patients (Mann–Whitney U test).

 The diagnostic criteria for short telomere syndromes thus re-
quire integrating TL results with clinical findings, and where
possible, genetic information. It is important to note that we
focused our analyses on lymphocyte and granulocyte TL mea-
surements. We note that while TL measurement in lympho-
cyte subsets is technically feasible (23), it has failed to show
superiority over total lymphocyte TL in distinguishing dysker-
atosis congenita from other inherited bone marrow failure
syndromes (31).
There has been a recent emerging trend of direct to consumer
advertising of TL measurement claiming it may be used to pre-
dict biological age and fitness. These methods generally rely on
PCR-based quantification, which has shown low reproducibility
in the literature (19) and in our study. This hospital-based experi-
ence provides an opportunity to caution clinicians and patients. TL
has a normal distribution at every age and small deviations from the
median within this distribution still fall in the normal range, and
their significance should not be overinterpreted or equated with
aging or youthfulness. Rigor in TL measurement is also critical,
as the predicted effect size of TL changes with some environ-
mental exposures, as reported in the literature, is often within
the error rate of the measurement for the quantitative PCR
method (32). Data from recently published large Mendelian ran-
domization studies have identified links between polymorphisms
associated with longer TL and the risk of common cancers, in-
cluding lung adenocarcinoma, melanoma, and glioma (33). The
upper threshold that increases the risk of these cancers is not
known, but these recent findings add significant warning to the
oversimplified interpretation of short TL being linked to aging
and long telomeres to youth. Overall, the evidence we present
suggests that TL testing should be targeted, and that it is most
informative in high-yield diagnostic settings, such as suspected
cases of short telomere syndromes, the interpretation of genetic
variation in telomerase and telomere maintenance genes, and in
the evaluation of bone marrow failure and related disorders.
When a robust and validated method is utilized in these defin-
able settings, the results have the potential to avert significant
morbidity and alter treatment decisions in a way that advances
patient care outcomes.
Materials and Methods
Study Review and Approval. The clinical studies included here were reviewed
and approved by the Johns Hopkins Medicine Institutional Review Board, and
all of the research subjects gave written, informed consent.
Healthy Controls. To establish a normal range for TL, we recruited 183 vol-
unteers from the Baltimore area across the age spectrum from 2010 to 2011.
Volunteers were interviewed and excluded if they reported having a history
of HIV, cancer, hemophilia, or pulmonary fibrosis, or if they answered “yes”
when asked about a history of a major illness. Race was self-reported as
African American, Asian, or Caucasian. Peripheral blood was collected in EDTA-
containing vacutainer tubes (20 cc; Becton-Dickinson). Cord blood was har-
vested from 25 discarded placentae. Donor demographics are summarized in
Table S1. Mononuclear cells and residual granulocytes were separated by
density gradient and frozen at −80 °C until analysis. TL measurements were
completed by June 2012. Among 208 samples analyzed by flowFISH, 192 (92%)
passed preset quality control measures: that is, less than 10% intraassay CV
among triplicate values, and more than 1,000 cell events for each of lymphocyte
and granulocyte populations. These values were then used to construct a no-
mogram, as described below. The raw lymphocyte and granulocyte TL values
are listed in Table S2.
Telomerase and Telomere Maintenance Gene Mutation Carriers. Subjects with
mutations in telomerase and telomerase maintenance genes were recruited
from 2003 to 2016 as part of the Johns Hopkins Telomere Syndrome Registry
(28, 34, 35). Entry criteria for this substudy to assess the value of TL testing
included familial and sporadic cases with a pathogenic mutation in a telomerase
or telomere maintenance gene. Rare variants in the known telomere or

Utility of TL in the diagnosis of idiopathic bone marrow failure. (A) Lymphocyte TL in 38 prospectively recruited patients with idiopathic aplastic
anemia (AA) relative to controls. The red circles denote patients for whom a genetic diagnosis was identified with documentation of a mutation in a telomere
maintenance gene (TERT n = 4, TR n = 1, RTEL1 n = 1, DKC1 n = 1, TINF2 n = 1) or nontelomere gene (GATA2 n = 2, RUNX1 n = 1, LIG4 n = 1). The latter group
is denoted by an asterisk (*). The blue circles denote patients treated with immunosuppression who responded (all the treated patients responded). The
remaining cases, denoted by black and gray circles, denote cases of constitutional aplastic anemia and untreated cases, respectively. Larger circles indicate the
22 patients who reached an informative endpoint (either a genetic diagnosis made or treatment with immunosuppression). (B) The degree of deviation from
the age-adjusted median (ΔT) from three groups is shown: prospectively recruited patients who had a response to immunosuppression at 1 y (n = 10,
5 complete response, 5 partial response), patients with telomerase and telomere gene mutations identified in A (TERT, TR, RTEL1, DKC1, TINF2, n = 8), as well
as 11 patients successfully treated with immunosuppression who were in remission for 2 y or more. Means ± SEM are shown, Mann–Whitney U test. The 1st,
10th, and 90th percentiles are annotated to the right in B.

 telomerase genes were deemed pathogenic if they segregated with short
telomere phenotypes or had functional molecular evidence of pathogenicity
(e.g., telomerase activity assay), as previously described (11, 29, 35–37). The
mutations are listed in Table S4. The age at diagnosis and telomere phenotype
were extracted from the medical record, as previously described (11, 12, 18).
Patients with liver disease had hepatopulmonary syndrome or biopsy-proven
cirrhosis. Primary immunodeficiency in this study referred to severe combined
immunodeficiency.
Bone Marrow Failure Study. Newly diagnosed, treatment-naïve children and
adults with idiopathic bone marrow failure from birth and up to the age of
40 y were prospectively recruited from patients who were evaluated at or
referred to the Johns Hopkins Hospital from 2012 to 2014. Exclusion criteria
included a positive chromosome breakage study, indicating Fanconi ane-
mia, a history of a known inherited bone marrow failure syndrome, per-
sonal history of classic mucocutaneous features of dyskeratosis congenita,
or a family history of bone marrow failure, pulmonary fibrosis, liver cir-
rhosis, or hematologic malignancy. Patients were classified as having con-
stitutional aplastic anemia if they had a history of developmental delay,
intellectual disability, or other congenital anomaly. Clinical data were
extracted from medical records and study endpoints were assessed at the
2-y time point. Table S5 summarizes the clinical characteristics of these
38 patients. Subjects who were retrospectively studied were treated for
severe aplastic anemia at the Johns Hopkins Hematology Clinics and were
recruited from 2011 and 2012 based on a history of durable remission (>1 y)
after immunosuppressive therapy. Their characteristics are summarized in
Table S6.
TL Measurement. TL was measured by flowFISH following the detailed
protocol in Baerlocher et al. (24), except that peripheral blood mono-
nuclear cells were extracted by density gradient separation before pre-
serving in freezing media. Red cells were lysed at the time of thawing (RBC
Lysis Buffer; eBioscience). Cow thymus was obtained from a local butcher
and fixed thymocytes were mixed with each sample (24). A peptide nucleic
acid (PNA) labeled probe containing the sequence (CCCTAA)3 was used for
the hybridization (Alexa Fluor 488; PNA Bio). Each sample was run in triplicate
in addition to a no probe to account for background (24). The average lym-
phocyte and granulocyte TL were then calculated. A reference sample with
known TL, obtained from a large leukapheresis product, was used to nor-
malize fluorescence values on each plate. For this sample, the leukocyte TL was
measured by Southern blot (1), as well as by flowFISH at a company (Repeat
Diagnostics). Intra- and interassay CV was calculated by dividing the SD (σ) by
the mean (μ).
Nomogram Generation. Lymphocyte and granulocyte TL from healthy vol-
unteers were read into R/Bioconductor (38). A linear model (39) with the TL
as response and square root of age as predictor was fitted based on a
strong correlation and supported by evidence of the same relationship in
long-lived marine birds (40) (Fig. S1A). Using the fitted model, we pre-
dicted the TL for individuals 0–100 y with the 1-y step. For every predicted
value, the 1st, 10th, 50th, 90th, 95th, and 99th percentile predictions
were generated. The same analyses were then performed for the raw
control data from Aubert et al. (23) (termed Vancouver). Comparisons
between the Johns Hopkins and Vancouver laboratories were limited to
similarly prepared samples (i.e., frozen), given the known effect of freezing
on TL (23). Quantitative PCR was performed as previously described (20).
DNA Sequencing and Analysis. DNA was extracted from peripheral blood
(PureGene Blood Core Kit; Qiagen). Mutations were detected by either
PCR amplification and Sanger sequencing, as described previously (11, 41),
whole-exome sequencing (29, 37), whole-genome sequencing (35), or
custom amplicon sequencing followed by confirmation with Sanger se-
quencing (12). For targeted panel sequencing, we designed a TruSeq Custom
Amplicon probe set (Illumina) that included the coding and flanking
intronic sequences of telomere genes (TERT, TR, DKC1, RTEL1, NAF1, TINF2,
CTC1, PARN, NOP10, NHP2, TCAB1) and GATA2 (including the intron 4 en-
hancer). Libraries were generated from 500 ng of DNA according to
manufacturer recommendations and analyzed on a MiSeq sequencer
(Illumina) (12). The mean coverage of target sequence was 238× and 88% of
the target sequences were covered at or greater than 8×.
Statistics. We used GraphPad Prism to graph the data and analyze the sta-
tistics, except for the nomogram generation and comparison of distributions,
which were performed as detailed above. All P values are two-sided.
