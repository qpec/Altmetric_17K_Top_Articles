ABSTRACT
Affinity-matured, functional anti-pathogen antibodies are present at low frequencies in natural human
repertoires. These antibodies are often excellent candidates for therapeutic monoclonal antibodies.
However, mining natural human antibody repertoires is a challenge. In this study, we demonstrate a new
method that uses microfluidics, yeast display, and deep sequencing to identify 247 natively paired anti-
pathogen single-chain variable fragments (scFvs), which were initially as rare as 1 in 100,000 in the human
repertoires. Influenza A vaccination increased the frequency of influenza A antigen-binding scFv within
the peripheral B cell repertoire from <0.1% in non-vaccinated donors to 0.3-0.4% in vaccinated donors,
whereas pneumococcus vaccination did not increase the frequency of antigen-binding scFv. However, the
pneumococcus scFv binders from the vaccinated library had higher heavy and light chain Replacement/
Silent mutation (R/S) ratios, a measure of affinity maturation, than the pneumococcus binders from the
corresponding non-vaccinated library. Thus, pneumococcus vaccination may increase the frequency of
affinity-matured antibodies in human repertoires. We synthesized 10 anti-influenza A and nine anti-
pneumococcus full-length antibodies that were highly abundant among antigen-binding scFv. All 10 anti-
influenza A antibodies bound the appropriate antigen at KD<10 nM and neutralized virus in cellular
assays. All nine anti-pneumococcus full-length antibodies bound at least one polysaccharide serotype, and
71% of the anti-pneumococcus antibodies that we tested were functional in cell killing assays. Our
approach has future application in a variety of fields, including the development of therapeutic antibodies
for emerging viral diseases, autoimmune disorders, and cancer.

Introduction
Human antibody repertoires are a rich resource for anti-patho-
gen antibodies. Naturally occurring human antibodies are often
excellent candidates for therapeutics because they are affinity-
matured through normal B cell selection processes within a
person. Human antibody repertoires also provide insight into
antigenic targets for humoral immunity.1,2 Naturally paired
human antibodies have been identified using various technolo-
gies,3 including human hybridomas,4,5 clonal expansion of
primary B cells,6 and Epstein-Barr Virus transformation.7,8
However, the field of human antibody discovery remains con-
strained by the technical challenges of efficiently capturing rare
B cell clones using these methods.
The advent of modern genomic technologies now provides
alternative workflows for human antibody repertoire mining.
These methods use multiplexed PCR or RT-PCR to amplify
rearranged V(D)J sequences to generate diverse libraries of
antibody sequences, which are then subjected to “deep”
sequencing to acquire millions of antibody sequences.9,10
Because millions of B cells are assayed in a single reaction, deep
sequencing provides a far more comprehensive representation
of human antibody repertoires than human hybridoma screen-
ing. However, there are complications to most deep sequencing
methods, including: 1) determining native heavy and light
chain pairing and 2) linking such an enormous number of anti-
body sequences to function.
Pioneering work has described methods that retain pairing of
heavy and light chain through 96-well plate sorting11-14 and with
microfluidic devices.15 The utility of heavy and light chain pairing
for functional analysis has also been demonstrated by combining
96-well plate sorting, yeast single chain variable fragment (scFv)
display, and deep sequencing for discovery of mouse monoclonal
antibodies (mAbs).16 However, we are not aware of any published
reports of a genomic method that retains native single B cell pair-
ing of heavy and light chain and enables high-throughput affinity
screening of massively diverse human repertoires for rare anti-
bodies. In this study, we use modern emulsion droplet microflui-
dics to capture paired heavy and light chain libraries from
millions of single human B cells. The libraries are then expressed
as yeast scFv libraries and screened for binders.
We used our new method to mine human repertoires to
identify and characterize natural human mAbs reactive against

 influenza A virus and pneumococcus bacteria. These common
infections are leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the
United States, and provide an ideal system to test our method-
ology. In addition, deep sequencing of the humoral response to
influenza A virus17-18 and pneumococcus19 have already been
studied in detail, providing a useful reference for our methods.
We isolated and functionally tested 10 human mAbs that bind
influenza A, all of which neutralized viral infection. In addition,
we identified, characterized, and functionally tested nine
human mAbs that bind pneumococcal polysaccharides, five of
which induced bacterial killing opsonization.
Results
Overview of the experimental approach
Prior work has mined human repertoires for mAbs present in
the memory B cell (Bmem) compartment,1,2 or peripheral B cells
from recently vaccinated donors.17,18 For our work, we used
microfluidic methods to build a natively paired heavy and light
chain library from peripheral B cells derived from a pool of 52
healthy non-vaccinated donors (Fig. 1). We also built natively
paired heavy and light chain libraries from peripheral B cells
derived from donors vaccinated for influenza A virus (Fluvirin;
three
donors)
or
pneumococcus
(Pneumovax-23;
three
donors). Each non-vaccinated donor and vaccinated donor
library was built from at least 1 million cells, with a maximum
of 2.2 million cells (Supplementary Table S1).
Library generation was divided into three steps: 1) poly(A)C
mRNA capture, 2) multiplexed overlap extension reverse tran-
scriptase polymerase chain reaction (OE-RT-PCR), and 3)
nested PCR to remove artifacts and add adapters for deep
sequencing or yeast display libraries. For poly(A)C mRNA cap-
ture, we used a custom designed co-flow emulsion droplet
microfluidic chip fabricated from glass. The microfluidic chip
had two input channels for fluorocarbon oil, one input channel
for the cell suspension mix, and one input channel for oligo-dT
beads in cell lysis buffer. After cell lysis and capture of the
mRNA onto the dT beads, mRNA-bound beads were extracted
from the droplets. The beads were then re-suspended into OE-
RT-PCR mix and injected into a second co-flow microfluidic
chip with a mineral oil-based surfactant mix. The OE-RT-PCR
mix contained a mixture of primers directed against the IgK C
region, the IgG C region, and all V regions.11 The overlap
region was a DNA sequence that encodes a Gly-Ser-rich scFv
linker sequence.20 After isolation of the DNA fragments from
droplets, nested PCR was performed to add adapters for Illu-
mina sequencing or yeast display.
We queried the heavy and light chain V(D)J sequence
content for each library using deep sequencing. The primary
goal of deep sequencing was to estimate the size and diver-
sity of each library, not to fully assess the “long tail” of rare
sequences. The three libraries were transformed into yeast
for scFv display. After expansion and induction, the scFv
libraries were subjected to fluorescence-activated cell sorting
(FACS) to identify antigen-reactive clones. The vaccinated
donor libraries were analyzed for binders against their cog-
nate antigens, which included two influenza A virus antigens
(Fig. 2A) and a pool of 22 pneumococcal polysaccharide
antigens (Fig. 3A). The 52-donor non-vaccinated library was
analyzed for binders to the same antigens (Figs 2B, 3B).
After two (flu) or three (pneumococcal) rounds of FACS, we
purified plasmid from the recovered yeast and queried the
heavy and light chain V(D)J sequence content for each
library using deep sequencing.
We identified 247 anti-pathogen scFv sequences that were
present at �0.1% frequency among populations of clones selected
by FACS from vaccinated and non-vaccinated donor libraries
(Supplementary Tables S2-S7). For each scFv, we sequenced the
full-length V(D)J regions, including complementary-determining
region 3 (CDR3), and computed various sequence analysis met-
rics (V and J gene usage, divergence from germline, R/S ratio, and
IgG isotype). We then selected a subset of the highest frequency
sequences and re-engineered them as full-length IgG1 mAbs
(Tables 1–2). The mAbs were subjected to a panel of functional
assays, including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA),
bio-layer interferometry (BLI), serotype-specific dot blots, and
viral neutralization or multiplex opsonophagocytic killing assays,
which are further described below.
Characterization of antibody repertoires post vaccination
We define antibody “clones” as the consensus of closely related
groups of sequences with �2 amino acid differences in their
CDR3 sequences. The overall diversity of antibody clones in
the pre-sort libraries (non-vaccinated donors, influenza A vac-
cinated donors, and pneumococcus vaccinated donors) were
similar, ranging from 10,000-17,500 antibody clones (Supple-
mentary Table S1). As expected, the frequency distributions of
the antibodies were different (Supplementary Figure S1). The
non-vaccinated library (built from 52 donors) had a single
clone with >0.2% abundance, then a very long tail of low abun-
dance antibodies. In contrast, both vaccinated libraries (built
from 3 donors each) had many highly abundant antibody
sequences, and the drop-off in abundance in the tail was more
gradual. The low abundance tail was similar across libraries,
where the 200th most abundant antibody from each library
was 0.03%-0.06% of reads.
We determined the IgG isotype of these antibodies by
sequencing into the constant domain region to capture isotype-
Figure 1. Overview of the workflow used to generate the scFv libraries from B cells
isolated from human donors. Peripheral B cells are isolated from either vaccinated
or non-vaccinated human donors. B cells are then encapsulated into droplets with
oligo-dT beads and a lysis solution. The throughput of microfluidic cell encapsula-
tion is » 3 million cells per hour. mRNA-bound beads are purified from the drop-
lets, and then injected into a second emulsion with an OE-RT-PCR amplification
mix that generates DNA amplicons that encode scFv with native pairing of heavy
and light chain Ig. Libraries of natively paired amplicons are then electroporated
into yeast for scFv display. FACS is used to identify high affinity scFv. Finally, deep
antibody sequencing is used to identify all clones in the pre- and post-sort scFv
libraries. The complete workflow, from isolated B cells to sequenced scFv candi-
dates, requires only three weeks.

 specific sequence. The non-vaccinated donors were 46% IgG1,
30% IgG2, 22% IgG3, and 2% IgG4 (Supplementary Table S1).
Upon flu vaccination, IgG1 abundance increased to 57%,
whereas IgG2 abundance decreased to 21% (with little to no
change in IgG3/4 abundance). Upon pneumococcal vaccina-
tion, IgG2 abundance increased to 81% and all other isotypes
decreased, consistent with prior observations that IgG2 is the
main isotype used for pneumococcal antibodies.21 All flu bind-
ing mAbs from vaccinated donors were IgG1, and consistently
»90% of the flu binding mAbs from non-vaccinated donors
were also IgG1. For pneumococcal binding mAbs, 92% from
vaccinated donors were IgG2, and 79% from non-vaccinated
donors were IgG2.
Assessment of Replacement (R) as opposed to Silent (S)
nucleotide mutations is often used to identify antigen-driven
affinity selection of antibody sequences.22 A higher R/S ratio
implies somatic hypermutation. We tabulated the R and S val-
ues across the V(D)J region, exclusive of CDR3 and framework
4 (FR4), for a random sample of » 1,000 antibodies each from
the pre-sort libraries (Supplementary Table S8). The R/S ratio
for IgH in the pneumococcal vaccinated library (3.26) was sig-
nificantly higher than the non-vaccinated library (2.92; t-test,
p<0.01), whereas the R/S ratio for IgK in the pneumococcal
vaccinated library (2.57) was significantly lower than the non-
vaccinated library (3.75; t-test, p<0.01). It is unknown why the
IgH R/S ratio was higher in the pneumococcal vaccinated
library while the IgK R/S ratio was lower. There was no signifi-
cant difference between the R/S ratios of the influenza A vacci-
nated donors and the non-vaccinated donors.
Overall divergence from germline is another metric to
identify antigen-driven antibody evolution. To this end,

95.0%, respectively. There were no significant differences
between the %IDs of the pneumococcal-vaccinated IgHV
and IgKV compared to the non-vaccinated library. How-
ever, influenza A vaccination generated a repertoire with
significantly higher IgHV %ID (92.9%) than the non-vac-

 Isolation of pathogen antigen binders by yeast display
Yeast scFv libraries were stained for scFv expression (using
a C-terminal c-Myc tag) and antigen binding. In a typical
FACS dot plot, the upper right corner contains double-posi-
tive yeast that stain for both antigen binding and scFv
expression. The lower left corner contains yeast that do not
stain for either the antigen or scFv expression. The upper
left corner contains yeast that stain for antigen but do not
stain for scFv expression, presumably due to non-specific
binding of antigen to yeast cell surfaces. For unknown rea-
sons, such non-specific binding events were particularly evi-
dent in the pneumococcal antigen experiments. The lower
right corner contains yeast that express the scFv but do not
bind the antigen. We estimate the frequency of binders in
each repertoire by dividing the count of yeast that double
stain by the count of yeast that express an scFv.
The yeast scFv library from influenza A vaccinated donor
peripheral B cells was typically 0.3-0.4% double positive,
whereas the non-vaccinated donor scFv library was typically
<0.1% double positive for two different influenza A antigens
(Fig. 2). The H3N2 antigen (from the A/Sydney/5/1997 strain)
and the H1N1 antigen (from the A/California/07/2009 strain)
yielded similar frequencies of binders. In contrast, pneumococ-
cal vaccination did not increase the frequency of binders in
peripheral B cell repertoires, with vaccinated donors showing
0.1% and non-vaccinated donors showing 0.16% double-posi-
tive yeast (Fig. 3). Negative (Fc) controls always yielded <0.04%
double-positive yeast, consistent with low non-specific staining.
To increase antigen specificity, we expanded the FACS-sorted
yeast from each scFv display library, and then performed a sec-
ond round of FACS. The frequency of binders in the second sort
was as low as 4% (for pneumococcal antigen with vaccinated
donors) or as high as 76% (for H3N2 with vaccinated donors).
For pneumococcal antigen, because the frequency of binders in
the second sort was still relatively low, we performed a third sort
that increased the frequency of binders to »70%.
We used antibody repertoire sequencing to assess the clonal
diversity of each population of binders. As might be expected, the
enrichment from the original repertoire to the population of bind-
ers was more pronounced in the non-vaccinated samples than the
vaccinated samples. For example, pneumococcus binding antibody
NonVax-Pn-1 was detected in the initial non-vaccinated repertoire
at 0.00018%, and was present at 31% frequency after 3 rounds of
FACS (Supplementary Table S7). Similarly, H3N2 binder Non-
Vax-H3-1 was present in the un-vaccinated repertoire at 0.01%,
and was enriched to 67% frequency after 2 rounds of FACS (Sup-
plementary Table S5). Some binders were highly enriched in the
post-sort data, but were apparently so rare in the original repertoire
that they were not detected at all. For example, H1N1 binder Non-
Vax-H1-1 was present in the post-sort data at 44% frequency, but
was not detected in the original 52-donor non-vaccinated, pre-sort
library (Supplementary Table S4).
We did not observe oligoclonality in the vaccinated or non-
vaccinated libraries before sorting. However, we observed that
FACS selection resulted in a significant increase in oligoclonality.
For example, in each post-sort library, the top four scFv sequences
accounted for >60% of the scFv sequences in the deep sequencing
data (versus 4.7% on average for the input repertoires). Despite
this oligoclonality, the post-sort libraries maintained substantial
diversity; the library with the highest number of scFv sequences
with frequencies of 0.1% or greater was the H1N1 non-vaccinated
sample, with 59 scFv sequences. The library with the fewest scFv
sequences at frequencies of 0.1% or greater was the H1N1 vacci-
nated sample, with 31 scFv sequences.
Some of the FACS plots, for example the pneumococcal
antigen 2nd and 3rd sorts, showed at least two distinct popula-
tions of antigen binders. To investigate this phenomenon, we
sorted the two distinct populations of antigen binders for both
the vaccinated and non-vaccinated donor libraries (Supplemen-
tary Figure S2). Sequence analysis of each population revealed
non-overlapping, oligoclonal sets of scFv sequences. We postu-
late that these non-overlapping sets of scFv sequences bind to
different kinds of pneumococcal epitopes, resulting in distinct
populations on the FACS plots. For example, certain scFv could
bind to multiple epitopes on a given pneumococcal polysaccha-
ride, which would increase the antigen-positive signal on the
FACS plot. Another possibility is that some polysaccharide
serotypes are labeled with more biotin molecules than other
polysaccharide serotypes, leading to shifts in signal along the
y-axis of the FACS plots.
Sequence characteristics of pathogen antigen binders
Affinity maturation and selection in vivo generates clonal
lineages of similar antibody sequences. To investigate clonal
lineages among FACS-sorted scFv binders, we clustered cog-
nate-paired V(D)J sequences with at most 9 amino acid

 differences (Fig. 4). We define a “large clonal cluster” as clusters
of three or more cognate-paired V(D)J sequences. We identi-
fied two large clonal clusters of H3N2 scFv binders and four
large clonal clusters of H1N1 binders. Only one of the six anti-
influenza four large clonal clusters was a mixture of scFv from
both the vaccinated library and the non-vaccinated library.
Seven large clonal clusters were identified among pneumococ-
cal antigen scFv binders. None of these clusters was a mixture
of scFv from both the vaccinated library and the non-vacci-
nated library. The clustering analysis suggests that we identified
anti-influenza A scFv from at least 44 clonal clusters and anti-
pneumococcus scFv from at least 32 clonal clusters.
Understanding the amino acid residues that are conserved
and variable during affinity maturation may help guide subse-
quent directed in vitro affinity maturation. Therefore, we
aligned the full-length amino acid sequences for several clonal
clusters (Fig. 4, 5). We found that most of the sequence varia-
tion within a clonal cluster was localized to the CDR3 regions,
with minimal variation in CDR1, CDR2, and framework
regions (54 variations in CDR3 regions of 90 total variations).
We found that clonal cluster members that were enriched from
the vaccinated libraries showed variation in the CDR3H with
minimal variation in the light chain CDR3 (Fig. 5A), whereas
the opposite was true for family members enriched from the
Figure 4. Clonal cluster analysis for FACS-sorted scFv binders. We computed the total number of amino acid differences between each pairwise alignment of FACS-sorted
scFv. Edges were drawn only for pairwise alignments with �9 amino acid differences. The node for each scFv sequence was sized based on frequency in the FACS-sorted
population: small (<1% frequency), medium (1-10% frequency), and large (>10% frequency). Web logos of the CDR3K C CDR3H amino acid sequences of the clusters
used in Figure 5 are on the right. (A) Clonal clusters for anti-H3N2 scFv (blue) and anti-H1N1 scFv (red). scFv isolated from vaccinated donors are indicated with squares,

 non-vaccinated libraries, with most of the variation in the light
chain CDR3 (Fig. 5B). We note that if the sequence variation
within the clonal clusters were due to sequencing error alone, it
is unlikely that most substitutions would occur within the
CDR3.
As expected,21 most of the pneumococcus binders (83.5%)
are IgG2, whereas most of the H1N1 and H3N2 binders are
IgG1. Only two IgG3 scFv were present at 0.1% or greater fre-
quency across all the FACS-sorted binders. One of the IgG3
scFv was found in the population sorted with H1N1 (NonVax-
H1-14), and the other in the population sorted with H3N2
(NonVax-H3-12). Both IgG3 antibodies were captured from
the non-vaccinated donor library. The scFv are identical in
amino acid sequence across the heavy chain VDJ. However, the
light chain VJ sequences are only 80% identical; they share J-
region IgKJ5�01 but differ in their IgKV sequences (Supple-
mentary Tables S4-S5). The shared heavy chain VDJ shows
signs of affinity maturation (R/S ratio: 5.25), which is consistent
with class-switched IgG3 antibodies. We did not observe any
IgG4 scFv among the FACS-sorted binders.
We calculated the average IgH and IgK R/S ratios across
FACS-sorted scFv binders (Supplementary Table S9). For
pneumococcal antigen, R/S ratios for scFv binders from the
vaccinated library were significantly higher (t-test, p<0.01)
than for scFv binders from the corresponding non-vaccinated
libraries (3.61 vs. 2.35 for IgH and 2.57 vs. 1.46 for IgK). This
suggests that Pneumovax increases the frequency of the most
highly affinity-matured pneumococcal antibodies in human

 repertoires. Similarly, the average IgK R/S ratios for H3N2 and
H1N1 scFv binders were also significantly higher (t-test,
p<0.01) from the influenza A vaccinated libraries (2.35 vs. 1.86
for H3N2 and 2.01 vs. 1.70 for H1N1). In contrast, the average
IgH R/S ratios for H3N2 and H1N1 scFv binders from the
influenza A vaccinated libraries were either no different or sig-
nificantly lower, respectively, compared with the non-vacci-
nated libraries (2.50 vs. 2.86 for H3N2 and 3.04 vs. 5.41 for
H1N1). This suggests that Fluvirin may not increase the fre-
quency of the most highly affinity-matured anti-influenza A
antibodies in human repertoires, especially in the heavy chain.
The average nucleotide %ID to germline V gene across all
FACS-sorted clones was 94.2% for IgK and 94.6% for IgG. This
level of divergence corresponds to an average of 6–7 amino
acid substitutions per V gene. The most divergent IgK was
NonVax-Pn-25 (88.1% ID), and the most divergent IgG was
NonVax-H1-4 (85.0% ID). We compared the %ID values from
the FACS-sorted clones from the vaccinated and non-vacci-
nated libraries and found that most of the populations were not
significantly different (Supplementary Table S9). Only the set
of IgH scFv FACS-sorted with H1N1 from the Fluvirin vacci-
nated library had a significantly lower V-gene %ID than the
corresponding set of scFv isolated from the non-vaccinated
library (92.4% vs. 96.9% ID, respectively; t-test, p<0.01).
Functional validation of select mAbs
We selected several of the highest frequency mAbs from each
FACS-sorted library to make as full-length antibodies with an
IgG1 constant region (Tables 1–2). The full-length antibodies
were produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells and purified by
Protein A chromatography. The binding specificity and affinity
of each flu-targeted antibody towards each of the two antigens
was determined using BLI. Antibodies sorted with either H1N1
or H3N2 only bound to their respective antigen, indicating
high specificity towards the sorted antigen (Table 1, Supple-
mentary Figures S3-S4). Each antibody bound with high affin-
ity, with KD ranging from 73pM–8.8nM.
Influenza virus neutralization assays were performed to
determine whether these anti-flu antigen antibodies can neu-
tralize the infectivity of specific influenza strains. For this, influ-
enza viral strains A/Sydney/5/1997 (for H3N2 binders) or A/
California/07/2009 (for H1N1 binders) were incubated with
the appropriate antibodies at multiple dilutions. The virus/anti-
body mixtures were then added to Madin-Darby canine kidney
(MDCK) cells and cytopathic effects were measured. If the anti-
body is not capable of neutralizing, the influenza virus will lead
to visible cytopathic effects; if the antibody is neutralizing, then
the MDCK cells will survive. Each of the 10 mAbs that we
tested neutralized the matched influenza A strain, with specific
activities ranging from 0.012 to 50 mg/ml (Supplementary
Figure S5, Table 1).
Pneumococcal antigen-binding antibodies were first vali-
dated for their ability to bind a pool of pneumococcal polysac-
charides by ELISA. We found that all purified antibodies
bound to the pneumococcal antigen pool with EC50s ranging
from 0.001 nM to 5.3 nM (Supplementary Figure S6; Table 2).
We then performed serotype-specific dot blots to determine
the specificity of each mAb. Most of the mAbs bound to one or
two serotypes, whereas two antibodies (one from vaccinated
donors and one from non-vaccinated donors) bound non-spe-
cifically to most of the serotypes (Supplementary Figure S7;
Table 2).
To determine if the pneumococcus-binding antibodies are
functional, multiplex opsonophagocytic killing assays were per-
formed. These assays measure antibody-mediated bacterial kill-
ing opsonization, which is the ability of the antibody to mark
serotype-specific bacteria strains for ingestion/phagocytosis
and subsequent killing. Most of the serotype-specific binders
induced bacterial killing against the appropriate serotype
(Table 2). Additional serotypes were tested to determine speci-
ficity, and we generally found that the mAbs were serotype-spe-
cific in their killing activity. One exception was antibody pVax-
Pn-4, which bound to serotype 1 and had strong ELISA bind-
ing, but did not induce killing of serotype 1 bacteria. Across all
mAbs that we tested, there was no association between the anti-
body dilution required for ELISA binding and the antibody
dilution required for bacterial killing. We also tested the mAbs
that non-specifically bound to many serotypes against several
serotype strains. We found that the non-specific binder from
vaccinated donors (pVax-Pn-13) could cause specific killing
against two of the eight serotypes tested, whereas the other
non-specific binder (NonVax-Pn-3) did not show any activity
against any of the tested serotypes.
Discussion
In this study, we identified 247 anti-pathogen scFv binders that
were initially as rare as 1 in 100,000 in human repertoires.
These scFv sequences represented at least 76 distinct clonal
clusters. To our knowledge, this is among the largest existing
datasets of antigen-specific, naturally occurring human anti-
body sequences. This is also the first known success at generat-
ing natural cognate-paired scFv libraries from >1,000,000
single cells, and then screening the scFv libraries for antigen
binders. For example, prior work with 96-well plates generated
natural cognate-paired scFv libraries from thousands of single
cells,11 and prior work with microfluidics did not screen scFv
libraries for antigen binders.16 We validated several of the scFv
as full-length antibodies. All 10 full-length anti-influenza A
antibodies tested specifically bound the appropriate antigen at
KD<10 nM and neutralized the appropriate viral strain in cel-
lular assays. Affinities and neutralization potencies were similar
to prior work on influenza A.12,14 All nine anti-pneumococcus
full-length antibodies tested bound at least one polysaccharide
serotype, and 71% of the anti-pneumococcus antibodies that
we tested were functional in a cell killing assay. With further
development, these selected mAbs could be candidates for pas-
sive immunization against their respective pathogens/serotypes.
Our method is primarily limited by microfluidic and FACS
throughput, whereas other methods are limited by efficiency of
B cell transformation or expansion. For example, B cell trans-
formation is typically <1%.23 Therefore, our methodology
complements more established methods.
Previous studies have also successfully identified antigen-
specific sequences among diverse antibody repertoires.9 One

 immunodeficiency virus binder.24 In another
study, the
researchers vaccinated donors with seasonal influenza vaccine,
paired heavy and light chain Ig through 96-well plate cloning
and sequencing, and then identified binders by focusing specifi-
cally on clonal expansions.14 Another interesting method is to
identify convergent antibodies, for example, antibodies shared
by identical twins after a recent vaccination.25 In contrast, our
method does not require convergence, a priori knowledge of
antigen-specific sequences, or clonal expansions to identify
reactive antibodies. This has enabled us to discover rare binders
in highly diverse, non-vaccinated repertoires, and in vaccinated
samples without the need for identical twins or pre-vaccination
repertoires. For expedience and because functional mAb dis-
covery was the primary goal of this study, we built libraries
from pools of donors rather than individual donors. To answer
questions regarding differences and similarities between donor
immune repertoires, future work could build and study librar-
ies from individual donors.
Our study also contributes to a growing body of work on the
sequence characteristics of anti-pathogen immune repertoires.
We found an average of 6–7 amino acid substitutions per V
gene in the anti-pathogen scFvs. Prior work on influenza A14
and pneumococcus26-30 found similar rates of divergence from
germline. In our work, each collection of FACS-sorted binders
contained 1–4 clusters of evolutionarily related clones, i.e.,
putative clonal lineages. Prior work used very different experi-
mental approaches, so it would be difficult to directly compare
the nature of our clonal lineages with prior data. For example,
other studies separated donors into age groups17 or looked
exclusively at plasmablasts.14 Though the humoral response to
pneumococcus is primarily IgG2,27 prior work has shown that
intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) contains a significant
component of anti-pneumococcus IgG1.31 Accordingly, we
found that 16.4% of pneumococcus scFv binders were IgG1.
One limitation to our current protocol is that we are unable to
trace individual antibody sequences back to single cells. There-
fore, the frequency of antibody sequences in our libraries is a
function of: 1) the number of cells expressing the antibody and
2) the mRNA expression levels of those cells. To trace back
antibody sequences to single cells, future work could consider
adding nucleic acid barcodes to the scFv amplicons.32,33 Such a
method would enable more precise measurements of clones
and clonal lineages.
Similar to other groups studying natural repertoire pneu-
mococcus antibodies,30 we identified clones that are pan-sero-
type binders. It is possible that these antibodies are reactive
against C-polysaccharide, a common cell-wall-associated anti-
gen present across several species of pathogenic bacteria.34
Most people have high titers of non-protective antibodies
against this antigen. However, one of the non-specific anti-
bodies (pVax-Pn-13) could induce specific killing of two of
the eight serotypes tested. We speculate that pVax-Pn-13
binds C-polysaccharide as well as serotype-specific polysac-
charides. These observations raise the possibility that human
repertoires contain pan-serotype binders that may also pro-
vide broad protection against multiple serotypes. Such binders
would be excellent therapeutic mAb candidates. Future stud-
ies might also use our technology for more precise epitope
mapping of pneumococcus antibodies.35
Broadly reactive anti-influenza A antibodies36-38 are excel-
lent therapeutic candidates because influenza A antigenic drift
complicates development of passive immunotherapies. How-
ever, our FACS strategy selected for scFv that bound a single
influenza A strain. Accordingly, all 10 anti-influenza A full-
length antibodies that we tested bound and neutralized a single
influenza A strain. In future work, we envision a modified
FACS strategy that selects scFv that bind multiple influenza A
strains. For example, H1N1 and H3N2 could be labeled with
different fluorophores, and scFv could be selected that bind to
both strains, rather than a single strain. This approach could be
useful in analogous contexts, for example, selecting scFv that
bind both human and simian antigens, or scFv that bind an
antigen, but not a closely related paralogue with high
homology.
Antibody repertoire diversity is vast, and alternative experi-
mental designs may allow for capture of higher affinity candi-
dates. For example, we did not separately analyze different
types of antibody-producing cells, such as plasma cells, plasma-
blasts, and Bmems. We found that scFv isolated from non-vacci-
nated donors did have different sequence characteristics from
scFv isolated from vaccinated donors. For example, light chains
were highly conserved within clonal expansions from vacci-
nated donors, but not from non-vaccinated donors. We may
have seen such differences because scFv isolated from non-vac-
cinated donors were from Bmems, whereas scFv isolated from
vaccinated donors were from activated and affinity-maturing
cells.12,18,39 We further speculate that bone marrow plasma cells
would be a rich source of high-affinity therapeutic mAb candi-
dates. Future work should also optimize the appropriate timing
of blood draws post-vaccination to capture high-affinity anti-
bodies, as studied elsewhere.40 However, there may be natural
limits to the affinity of antibodies derived from human reper-
toires,31 so in vitro affinity maturation may often be required as
part of subsequent development of repertoire-derived thera-
peutic candidates.
Our approach could be modified to leverage a variety of dis-
play and screening methods, for example, panning with phage
scFv display,41,42 FACS with yeast antigen-binding fragment
(Fab) display,43,44 or FACS with mammalian full-length anti-
body display.45,46 Our methods would most easily be adapted
to phage scFv display. We chose yeast scFv because we had
existing experience with yeast protocols and FACS. Though the
ideal yeast display format remains controversial, prior work
suggests scFv can bind with lower affinity than Fabs or full
length mAbs.47-49 We chose scFv because our OE-RT-PCR pro-
tocol is optimized for amplifying amplicons <2,000 nucleoti-
des. Adapting our protocol to Fab or full-length mAb display
would require amplification of a larger segment of the IgK and
IgG C regions. Finally, exploratory work has shown that engi-
neering millions-diverse full-length mammalian libraries from
OE-RT-PCR scFv amplicons is possible.50 In the future, full-
length mammalian libraries could be used for massively parallel
functional screens, for example, to directly discover rare neu-
tralizing antibodies from diverse repertoires.
The entire scFv binder discovery process, non-inclusive of
vaccinations and peripheral blood sample collection, was
accomplished in three weeks by one technician. Though esti-
mates of antibody diversity vary widely,18 our method analyzes

 three million cells per hour, allowing us to sample a large frac-
tion of immune repertoires. Full-length mAb expression used
conventional technology and required less than three weeks of
additional effort. With automation, it would be straightforward
to express >1,000 full-length mAbs per month. The speed and
convenience of our process would be especially beneficial to
programs looking to mine natural repertoires for therapeutic
antibodies against emerging pathogens, e.g., Zika or Ebola
viruses. We expect that the methodology will also be useful for
a variety of studies, such as characterization of pathogenic auto-
immune antibodies and their targets, examination of age-
related differences in vaccine response,17,19 or the identification
of novel immunogens for active vaccines.9
Materials and methods
Sourcing and processing human materials
To generate the 52-donor non-vaccinated library (ages 21–53),
we contracted AllCells, a contract research organization
(CRO), to collect whole blood from generally healthy human
donors into 6ml lavender-capped tubes (EDTA anticoagulant).
Tubes were shipped to GigaGen at room temperature. Periph-
eral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from the
blood using SepMateTM-50 tubes with LymphoprepTM density
gradient medium, and then B cells were isolated from the
PBMCs using the EasySepTM Human Pan-B Cell Enrichment
Kit (Stemcell Technologies).
For influenza A vaccinated libraries, we contracted AllCells
to vaccinate three donors (ages 26–34) with Fluvirin (Novartis)
and perform leukapheresis 10 days later to obtain PBMCs. In
parallel, plasma was isolated from a separate blood draw on the
day of leukapheresis; ELISA against Influenza A (IBL America)
on the plasma samples confirmed a response to the vaccine as
compared to plasma from the same donors prior to vaccina-
tion. For the pneumococcus vaccinated libraries, we contracted
AllCells to vaccinate five donors (ages 35–57) with Pneumo-
vax-23 (Merck) and perform leukapheresis eight days later. In
parallel, plasma was isolated from a separate blood draw on the
day of leukapheresis; ELISA against a pool of pneumococcal
vaccine polysaccharides (Alpha Diagnostics) on the plasma
samples confirmed a response to the vaccine for three of the
five donors as compared to plasma from a pool of healthy
donors. The three pneumococcus-responding donors were
used going forward. B cells from the PBMCs were isolated
using the EasySepTM Human Pan-B Cell Enrichment Kit
(Stemcell Technologies).
Sample collection protocols were approved by Institutional
Review Board (IRB) protocol #7000-SOP-045 (Alpha IRB, San
Clemente, CA), to AllCells. Informed consent was obtained
from all participants and de-identified samples were shipped to
GigaGen. After isolation, B cells were cryopreserved using Cry-
oStor� CS10 (Stemcell Technologies). Immediately prior to
generating paired heavy and light chain libraries, cells were
thawed, washed in cold DPBSC0.5% bovine serum albumin,
assessed for viability with Trypan blue on a CountessTM cell
counter (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and then re-suspended in
12% OptiPrepTM Density Gradient Medium (Sigma) at 5,000-
6,000 cells per ml. This cell mixture was used for microfluidic
encapsulation as described in the next section.
Generating paired heavy and light chain libraries
For poly(A)C mRNA capture, we used a custom-designed co-
flow emulsion droplet microfluidic chip fabricated from glass
(Supplementary Figure S8; Dolomite). The microfluidic chip
had two input channels for fluorocarbon oil (Dolomite), one
input channel for the cell suspension mix, and one input chan-
nel for oligo-dT beads (NEB) at 1.25 mg/ml in cell lysis buffer
(20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 0.5 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% Tween-
20, and 20 mM DTT). The input channels were etched to
50 mm £ 150 mm for most of the chip’s length, narrowed to
55 mm at the droplet junction, and were coated with hydropho-
bic Pico-Glide (Dolomite). Three Mitos P-Pump pressure
pumps (Dolomite) were used to pump the liquids through the
chip. Droplet size depends on pressure, but typically we found
that droplets of »45 mm diameter were optimally stable. Emul-
sions were collected into chilled 2ml microcentrifuge tubes and
incubated at 40 �C for 30 minutes for mRNA capture. The
beads were extracted from the droplets using Pico-Break
(Dolomite).
For multiplex OE-RT-PCR, we used glass Telos droplet
emulsion microfluidic chips (Dolomite). mRNA-bound beads
were re-suspended into OE-RT-PCR mix and injected into the
microfluidic chips with a proprietary mineral oil-based surfac-
tant mix (available commercially from GigaGen) at pressures
that generated 27 mm droplets. The OE-RT-PCR mix con-
tained 2 £ one-step RT-PCR buffer, 2.0 mM MgSO4, Super-
Script III reverse transcriptase, and Platinum Taq (Thermo
Fisher Scientific), plus a mixture of primers directed against the
IgK C region, the IgG C region, and all V regions11 (Supple-
mentary Figure S9). The overlap region was a DNA sequence
that encodes a Gly-Ser-rich scFv linker sequence.20 The DNA
fragments are recovered from the droplets using a proprietary
droplet breaking solution (available commercially from Giga-
Gen) and then purified using QIAquick PCR Purification Kit
(Qiagen).
For nested PCR, the OE-RT-PCR product was first run on a
1.7% agarose gel for 80 minutes at 150V. A band at 1200–1500
base pair (bp) corresponding to the linked product was excised
and purified using NucleoSpin Gel and PCR Clean-up Kit
(Macherey-Nagel). PCR was then performed to add adapters for
Illumina sequencing or yeast display; for sequencing a randomer
of seven nucleotides was added to increase base calling accuracy
in subsequent next generation sequencing steps. Nested PCR
was performed with 2 £ NEBNext High-Fidelity amplification
mix (NEB) with either Illumina adapter containing primers or
primers for cloning into the yeast expression vector. The nested
PCR product was run on a 1.2% agarose gel for 50 minutes at
150V. A band at 800–1100 bp was excised and purified using
NucleoSpin Gel and PCR Clean-up Kit (Macherey-Nagel).
Preparation of antigens for FACS
Human IgG1-Fc protein (Thermo Fisher Scientific), Influenza
A H3N2-His protein (A/Sydney/5/1997; Sino Biological) and
Influenza A H1N1-His protein (A/California/07/2009; Sino

 Biological) were biotinylated using the EZ-Link Micro Sulfo-
NHS-LC-Biotinylation kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The bio-
tinylation reagent was resuspended to 9 mM and added to the
protein at a 50-fold molar excess. The reaction was incubated
on ice for 2 hours, then the biotinylation reagent was removed
using Zeba desalting columns (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The
final protein concentration was calculated with a Bradford
assay.
Twenty-two of the 23 Pneumovax-23 polysaccharides were
purchased from ATCC (serotype 8 was not available at the
time of the study). For biotinylation, sugar solutions were pre-
pared at 1 mg/ml total sugar concentration in 0.1 M sodium
acetate, pH 5.5. A 20 mM solution of cold sodium meta-period-
ate was prepared in 0.1 M sodium acetate, pH 5.5 and stored on
ice in an amber tube. The two solutions were mixed at equal
volumes and incubated on ice for 30 minutes. The excess meta-
periodate was removed by buffer exchange using a Zeba desalt-
ing column (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manu-
facturer’s
instructions.
The
oxidized
and
desalted
sugar
solution was mixed with Hydrazide-LC-biotin (Thermo Fisher
Scientific) at 18.55 mg/ml in dimethyl sulfoxide, at a 9:1 ratio
(sugar:hydrazide-LC-biotin) to give a final concentration of
5 mM hydrazide-LC-biotin. Ten ml of 5 mM AminoLink
Reductant solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added per
milliliter of protein conjugation mixture (50 mM AminoLink
Reductant final). The reaction was incubated overnight at 4 �C.
The reaction was quenched by the addition of 50 ml 1M Tris,
pH 7.5 per milliliter of conjugation solution and incubation at
room temperature for 30 minutes. Excess reagents were
removed and the solution was buffer exchanged into phos-
phate-buffered saline (PBS) using a Zeba desalting column
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The final solution was not quantified, and instead
a specific volume was used for FACS screening.
Yeast library screening
We built a yeast surface display vector (pYD) that contains a
GAL1/10 promoter, an Aga2 cell wall tether, and a C-terminal
c-Myc tag (Supplementary Figure S10). The GAL1/10 promoter
induces expression of the scFv protein in medium that contains
galactose. The Aga2 cell wall tether is required to shuttle the
scFv to the yeast cell surface and tether the scFv to the extracel-
lular space. The c-Myc tag is used during the flow sort to stain
for yeast cells that express in-frame scFv protein. Saccharomy-
ces cerevisiae cells (ATCC) were electroporated (Bio-Rad Gene
Pulser II; 0.54 kV, 25 uF, resistance set to infinity) with gel-
purified nested PCR product and linearized pYD vector for
homologous recombination in vivo. Transformed cells were
expanded and induced with galactose, to generate yeast scFv
display libraries.
To confirm scFv surface expression, » 2 £ 106 cells from the
expanded scFv libraries were stained with anti-c-Myc (Thermo
Fisher Scientific A21281) and an AF488-conjugated secondary
antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific A11039). To select scFv-
expressing cells that bind to antigen, yeast cells were stained
with biotinylated antigen (7 nM final concentration for protein
antigens or 50 ml for polysaccharide antigens) and then stained
with
phycoerythrin
(PE)-streptavidin
(Thermo
Fisher
Scientific). Cells were then flow sorted on a BD Influx (Stanford
Shared FACS Facility) for double-positive cells (AF488C/PEC).
Recovered clones were then plated on SD-CAA plates with
kanamycin,
streptomycin,
and
penicillin
(Teknova)
and
expanded. The expanded first round FACS clones were then
subjected to a second (and sometimes third) round of FACS
with the same antigen at the same molarity (7 nM final concen-
tration for protein antigen) or volume (50 ml for polysaccharide
antigens). Plasmid minipreps (Zymo Research) were prepared
from yeast recovered from the final FACS sort. Tailed-end PCR
was used to add Illumina adapters to the plasmid libraries for
deep sequencing (Supplementary Figure S9).
Deep antibody repertoire sequencing
Deep antibody sequencing libraries were quantified using a
quantitative PCR Illumina Library Quantification Kit (KAPA)
and diluted to 17.5 pM. Libraries were sequenced on a MiSeq
(Illumina) using a 500 cycle MiSeq Reagent Kit v2, according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. To obtain high-quality
sequence reads with maintained heavy and light chain linkage,
we performed sequencing in two separate runs. In the first run
(“linked run”), we directly sequenced the scFv libraries to
obtain forward read of 340 cycles for the light chain V-gene
and CDR3, and reverse read of 162 cycles that covered the
heavy chain CDR3 and part of the heavy chain V-gene (Supple-
mentary Figure S11). In the second run (“unlinked run”), we
first used the scFv library as a template for PCR to separately
amplify heavy and light chain V-genes. Then, we obtained for-
ward reads of 340 cycles and reverse reads of 162 cycles for the
heavy and light chain Ig separately. This produced forward and
reverse reads that overlap at the CDR3 and part of the V-gene,
which increased confidence in nucleotide calls.
To remove base call errors, we used a previously published
expected error filtering method.51 The expected number of
errors (E) for a read was calculated from its Phred scores. By
default, reads with E>1 were discarded, leaving reads for which
the most probable number of base call errors is zero. As an
additional quality filter, singleton nucleotide reads were dis-
carded, because sequences found two or more times have a
high probability of being correct.52 Finally, we generated high-
quality, linked antibody sequences by merging filtered sequen-
ces from the linked and unlinked runs. Briefly, we wrote a series
of scripts in Python that first merges forward and reverse reads
from the unlinked run. We discarded any pairs of forward and
reverse sequences that contain mismatches. Next, we used the
nucleotide sequences from the linked run to query merged
sequences in the unlinked run. The final output from the scripts
was a series of full-length, high-quality V(D)J sequences, with
native heavy and light chain Ig pairing.
To identify reading frame and FR/CDR junctions, we first
processed a database of well-curated immunoglobulin sequen-
ces53 to generate position-specific sequence matrices (PSSMs)
for each FR/CDR junction (Supplementary Figure S12). We
used these PSSMs to identify FR/CDR junctions for each of the
merged nucleotide sequences generated using the processes
described above. This identified the protein reading frame for
each of the nucleotide sequences. CDR sequences that have a
low identity score to the PSSMs are indicated by an
MABS
1293
 exclamation point. Python scripts were then used to translate
the sequences. We required reads to have a valid predicted
CDR3 sequence, so, for example, reads with a frame-shift
between the V and J segments were discarded. Next, we ran
UBLAST54 using the scFv nucleotide sequences as queries, and
V and J gene sequences from the IMGT database53 as the refer-
ence sequences. The UBLAST alignment with the lowest E-
value was used to assign V and J gene families and compute
%ID to germline. R/S values were computed using V gene seg-
ments spanning the first amino acid through the FR3-CDR3
boundary. CDR3 and FR4 were not used in R/S value
computation.
To estimate the diversity of the libraries, we defined “clones”
conservatively (Supplementary Table S1). First, we concatenated
the CDR3K and CDR3H amino acid sequences from each scFv
sequence into a single contiguous amino acid sequence. Next, we
used UBLAST54 to compute the total number of amino acid dif-
ferences in all pairwise alignments between each concatenated
sequence in each data set. Groups of sequences with �2 amino
acid differences in the concatenated CDR3s were counted as a
single clone. Finally, we used the majority amino acid identity at
each residue position to generate the consensus amino acid
sequence of the clone from the sequences of the members of the
group.
To generate clonal cluster plots (Fig. 4), we first used
UBLAST54 to compute the total number of amino acid differen-
ces between each pairwise alignment of FACS-sorted scFv
sequences. Binders to influenza A antigens (H3N2 and H1N1)
were combined into a single analysis. Binders to pneumococcal
antigen were treated as an independent data set. Next, we used
the igraph R package55 to generate clustering plots for the pair-
wise alignments. Antibody clones are represented by “nodes” in
the plots. Each node was sized based on the frequency of the
antibody clone in the FACS-sorted population: small (<1% fre-
quency), medium (1-10% frequency), and large (>10% fre-
quency). We define “edges” as the links between nodes. The
“layout_with_kk” layout option was used to format the output.
Edges were drawn only for pairwise alignments with �9 amino
acid differences. Edge lengths are proportional to the number
of amino acid differences between linked nodes, i.e., longer
edges indicate more amino acid differences.
Monoclonal antibody expression and purification
The mAbs were expressed from a variant of the pCDNA5/FRT
mammalian expression vector (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The
vector used an EF1-alpha promoter (from pEF1a-IRES, Clon-
tech) for the light chain, followed by a BGH polyA sequence
from pCDNA5/FRT. The vector used the cytomegalovirus
promoter from pCDNA5/FRT for expression of the heavy
chain, followed by a BGH polyA sequence (Supplementary
Figure S13). Antibody expression constructs were built using
GeneBlocks (Integrated DNA Technologies) and NEBuilder�
HiFi DNA Assembly Master Mix (New England BioLabs). All
constructs were synthesized as human IgG1 isotype, regardless
of a given antibody’s IgG isotype in the original repertoire.
Constructs were transformed into NEB 10-beta E. coli and puri-
fied with the ZymoPURETM Plasmid Maxiprep Kit (Zymo
Research). The purified plasmid was then used for transient
transfection in the ExpiCHO system (Thermo Fisher Scien-
tific). Transfected cells were cultured for 7–9 days in ExpiCHO
medium and then antibodies were purified from filtered super-
natant using protein A columns (Millipore). Antibody purity
and proper size was verified by Coomassie stained SDS-PAGE
gel (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Monoclonal antibody characterization
For measurement of kinetics of binding to H1N1-His and
H3N2-His, antibodies were loaded onto an anti-Human IgG Fc
(AHC) biosensor using the Octet Red96 system (ForteBio) by a
CRO (LakePharma). Loaded biosensors were dipped into anti-
gen dilutions beginning at 300 nM, with 6 serial dilutions at
1:3. Kinetic analysis was performed using a 1:1 binding model
and global fitting (Supplementary Figures S3-S4).
A CRO (Virapur) performed the influenza microneutraliza-
tion assays. Briefly, serial dilutions of mAb were mixed with
titered stock influenza A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) or A/Syd-
ney/5/1997 (H3N2) strains and incubated for 1 hour at 37 �C.
The virus/antibody solution was then pipetted into a 96-well
plate of MDCK cells. The plates were incubated for 4 days at
37 �C. Viral infection of the cells was quantified using a micro-
scope. All measurements were performed in triplicate. The data
are presented as the lowest concentration of antibody that dis-
played neutralization activity in the assay (Supplementary
Figure S5).
For analysis of pneumococcal mAbs binding to a pool of 23
sugars, the human anti-S. pneumoniae vaccine (Pneumovax/
CPS23) IgG ELISA kit (Alpha Diagnostics) was used in parallel
with the human anti-S. pneumoniae CWPS/22F IgG ELISA kit
(Alpha Diagnostics). Antibody samples were absorbed with
C22 absorbent mix from the anti-S. pneumoniae CWPS/22F
IgG ELISA kit for 1 hour at room temperature at the highest
concentration of antibody tested to remove non-specific bind-
ing activity. After absorption, serial dilutions of antibody were
performed in Low non-specific binding sample diluent (Alpha
Diagnostics). Samples were then analyzed by anti-S. pneumo-
niae CWPS/22F IgG ELISA according to the manufacturer’s
instructions to confirm that non-specific binding activity was
removed by the absorption step, and analyzed by human anti-
S. pneumoniae vaccine (Pneumovax/CPS23) IgG ELISA to
determine the anti-S. pneumoniae titer. Quantitative measure-
ments were performed on a plate reader at 450 nm (Perkin
Elmer) (Supplementary Figure S6). EC50 values were calculated
using SoftMax Pro (Molecular Devices).
To determine the pneumococcus polysaccharide-binding
specificity of individual mAbs, a dot blot method was used.
Individual polysaccharides (ATCC), as well as the 22-polysac-
charide pool, were spotted onto a 0.45 mm nitrocellulose mem-
brane (VWR), 2 ml per spot at 2 mg/ml. Once the spots were
dry, the membrane was washed in PBST (1 £ PBS C 0.1%
Tween-20) 3 £ 5 minutes while shaking. The membrane was
blocked in 5% dry milk in PBST for 20–60 minutes, then
washed 3 times briefly with 1 £ PBST. The membrane was
then incubated with the purified mAb of interest diluted in 1 £
PBST for 1 hour at room temperature while shaking. After
1 hour the membrane was washed 3 £ briefly and then 3 £ 5
minutes shaking in PBST. The membrane was then incubated
1294
A. S. ADLER ET AL.
 with an HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (Thermo Fisher
Scientific 31410) for 45 minutes while shaking. The membrane
was washed 3 £ briefly and then washed in PBST for 3 £ 5
minutes while shaking. The membrane was visualized using
SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo
Fisher Scientific) on a c300 imaging system (Azure Biosystems)
(Supplementary Figure S7). Human intravenous immunoglob-
ulin (Gammagard) was used as a positive control, with the
expectation that it would bind to all polysaccharides, individu-
ally and as a pool.
Functional antibodies to pneumococcal serotypes were mea-
sured in a multiplexed opsonophagocytic assay as previously
described.56,57
