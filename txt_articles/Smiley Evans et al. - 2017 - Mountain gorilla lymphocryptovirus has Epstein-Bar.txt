Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infects greater than 90% of humans, is recognized as a significant comorbidity 
with HIV/AIDS, and is an etiologic agent for some human cancers. The critically endangered mountain 
gorilla population was suspected of infection with an EBV-like virus based on serology and infant 
histopathology similar to pulmonary reactive lymphoid hyperplasia (PRLH), a condition associated 
with EBV in HIV-infected children. To further examine the presence of EBV or an EBV-like virus in 
mountain gorillas, we conducted the first population-wide survey of oral samples for an EBV-like virus 
in a nonhuman great ape. We discovered that mountain gorillas are widely infected (n = 143/332) with 
a specific strain of lymphocryptovirus 1 (GbbLCV-1). Fifty-two percent of infant mountain gorillas were 
orally shedding GbbLCV-1, suggesting primary infection during this stage of life, similar to what is 
seen in humans in less developed countries. We then identified GbbLCV-1 in post-mortem infant lung 
tissues demonstrating histopathological lesions consistent with PRLH, suggesting primary infection 
with GbbLCV-1 is associated with PRLH in infants. Together, our findings demonstrate that mountain 
gorilla’s infection with GbbLCV-1 could provide valuable information for human disease in a natural 
great ape setting and have potential conservation implications in this critically endangered species.
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a gamma herpesvirus in the Lymphocryptovirus genus, is one of the most widespread 
and prevalent human pathogens, infecting over 90% of humans and persisting for their lifetimes1. In contrast 
with more developed countries, where people are primarily infected during adolescence, people living in less 
developed countries are usually first infected as infants2, 3. In infants, primary infection is either asymptomatic 
or associated with non-specific signs of a viral infection4. The prevalence of histolopathologic changes associ-
ated with primary infections in infancy is largely unknown because tissue biopsies are rarely collected. However, 
EBV has been implicated in the development of a wide variety of benign and malignant diseases associated with 
congenital or acquired immune dysfunction and has become of increasing concern with the prevalence of HIV/
AIDS globally. In young and adult humans with immune dysfunction, EBV has been associated with pulmonary 
reactive lymphoid hyperplasia, endemic Burkitt’s lymphoma, undifferentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and 
extra-nodal B-cell lymphomas5–7.
In nonhuman primates (hereafter referred to as primates), EBV-like lymphocryptoviruses have been associ-
ated with lymphoproliferative disorders and malignancies similar to those reported in immunodeficient humans8. 
In captive primates, lymphocryptoviruses have been associated with B-cell nasal lymphoma in simian immunode-
ficiency virus (SIV)-infected rhesus macaques, non-Hodgkin lymphomas in SIV-infected rhesus and cynomolgus

macaques, and T-cell lymphomas in SIV-infected pigtail and otherwise healthy Japanese macaques9–17. EBV-like 
lymphocryptoviruses are known to infect great apes: two types of lymphocryptoviruses similar to type 1 and 
type 2 EBV in humans have been detected in western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla; GgorLCV1 and 
GgorLCV2) and orangutans (Pongo spp; PpygLCV-1 and PpygLCV-2), and a lymphocryptovirus similar to type 1 
EBV has been detected in chimpanzees (PtroLCV-1)18, 19. Because it is difficult to conduct population-wide stud-
ies to detect viruses circulating in wild great apes, little is known about the epidemiology or associated patholo-
gies of EBV-like infections in great apes, particularly those associated with primary infection in infancy.
Mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei) are at high risk for contracting human pathogens because 
approximately 60% of their population is habituated to the presence of humans20, 21. Habituation involves grad-
ually familiarizing selected gorilla groups to the close presence of humans to ensure gorillas are accessible for 
conservation-related management, research, and tourism22. While habituation is a highly effective conservation 
strategy, it can expose great apes to pathogens23. Herpesviruses are chronically shed in saliva (between 84 and 
90% of human adults have been shown to orally shed EBV24, 25) and can remain stable in the environment for up 
to one week providing opportunities for mountain gorillas to contact viruses that humans have shed in parks or 
captive enclosures26. The potential for close proximity contact in captivity has been demonstrated through the 
detection of human herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1), an alphaherpesvirus, in a confiscated eastern lowland gorilla 
(Gorilla beringei graueri) cared for by human caretakers using a similar management strategy to confiscated moun-
tain gorillas27. Wild habituated mountain gorillas are also frequently documented to be in close proximity with 
humans28. While gammaherpesviruses are generally considered to be the most host specific of the herpesvirus 
subfamilies, a population level survey of potential cross-species herpesviral infections in great apes has not yet been 
performed. In experimental infections, EBV has the ability to infect multiple species including cotton-top tama-
rins, owl monkeys, common marmosets, rhesus macaques and cynomolgus monkeys29–33. In addition, a recent 
analysis of gammaherpesviral sequences from a wide range of mammals indicated that cross-species transmissions 
have historically occurred more frequently than previously estimated, with most attributable to bats and primates34.
In previous studies, all wild mountain gorillas sampled and tested were serologically positive for antibodies 
to human EBV35. However, it was unclear if these serological positives represented exposure to human EBV or 
cross-reactivity of the assay with a related virus. In addition, pulmonary reactive lymphoid hyperplasia (PRLH), 
consisting of lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia and/or follicular bronchiolitis7, a syndrome associated with pri-
mary EBV infection in immunosuppressed human infants and children36, 37, has been seen histologically in lung 
tissues collected post-mortem from mountain gorilla infants.
Here we investigated the epidemiology and origin of lymphocryptoviruses shed by wild human-habituated 
mountain gorillas in the two remaining mountain gorilla subpopulations, the Virunga gorillas residing in the 
Virunga Massif (spanning Rwanda, Uganda, and the Democratic Republic of Congo) and the Bwindi gorillas 
residing in the Bwindi Impenetrable Forest in Uganda. To date, investigation of great ape populations for orally 
shed viruses has been limited by the ability to non-invasively collect oral samples38. We implemented a novel 
chewed plant method to collect oral samples at a population-wide scale, for the first time in a great ape. We also 
conducted a retrospective study of infant necropsy cases over a 10-year period to examine mountain gorillas for 
naturally occurring asymptomatic primary EBV-like lesions. Our findings demonstrate that mountain gorillas 
are widely infected with a mountain gorilla-specific lymphocryptovirus with epidemiologic and pathologic sim-
ilarities to EBV in humans.
Results
Identification of lymphocryptovirus oral shedding in wild Bwindi and Virunga mountain gorillas. 
 
To study oral shedding of lymphocryptoviruses, discarded chewed plants were collected from 76.2% of the Bwindi 
and 47.6% of the Virunga human-habituated mountain gorillas (n = 294 gorillas from 26 family groups) (Fig. 1). 
These two mountain gorilla populations are estimated to have been genetically isolated from each other for more 
than 5,000 years39. Using consensus polymerase chain reaction (PCR) we applied broadly reactive degenerative 
primers to characterize the herpesviral DNA present on chewed plants targeting the DNA polymerase (DPOL), 
terminase (TERM) and glycoprotein B (gB) herpesviral genes. We identified the first evidence of an EBV-like 
virus, a mountain gorilla-specific strain of lymphocryptovirus 1 (GbbLCV-1), in wild mountain gorillas as well 
as herpesviruses in the cytomegalovirus and rhadinovirus subfamilies. Amplified lymphocryptovirus sequences 
did not show significant differences between Bwindi and Virunga gorillas, with 98.9% nucleotide and 98.7% 
amino acid similarity across a 473 bp fragment of the gB gene (Genbank accession #’s KU736789, KU736790); 
99.6% nucleotide and 100% amino acid similarity across a 230 bp fragment of the DPOL gene (Genbank acces-
sion #’s KU736786, KU736788); and 98.8% nucleotide and 97.9% amino acid similarity across a 424 bp fragment 
of the TERM gene (Genbank accession #’s KU736787, KU736791). Analysis of the gB gene fragments showed 
97.7–97.9% nucleotide and 99.4% amino acid similarity to GgorLCV-1 isolated from western lowland gorillas 
(AF534225) and 91.3–91.5% nucleotide and 96.2–97.5% amino acid similarity to human EBV (LN827799). 
Analysis of the DPOL fragment showed 98.9–99.3% nucleotide and 98.7–100.0% amino acid similarity to 
GgorLCV-1 (KU578068) and 89.7–90.2% nucleotide and 91.9–93.2% amino acid similarity to EBV (AB850649). 
TERM sequences for GgorLCV-1 were not available in the Genbank database. Sequences detected in all moun-
tain gorillas were most similar to GgorLCV-1 and did not show a close similarity to GgorLCV-2 (75.9–76.5% 
 
nucleotide and 74.5–75.8% amino acid similarity to GgorLCV-2 for the gB gene fragment; AY129395). Finding 
that GbbLCV-1 is most closely related to the western lowland gorilla lymphocryptovirus-1 is to be expected given 
the close phylogenetic relatedness of the host species.
Geographic distribution, demographic associations and prevalence of GbbLCV-1 in wild moun-

shedding. In addition, archived mountain gorilla blood samples, which had been collected during opportunis-
tic interventions, were examined to identify lymphocryptoviruses circulating in white blood cells (n = 23). We 
found oral shedding of GbbLCV-1 in 43.0% (143/332) of mountain gorillas, with 48.8% (83/170) of gorillas in the 
Virunga Massif and 37.0% (60/162) of gorillas in the Bwindi Impenetrable Forest orally shedding GbbLCV-1. Our 
estimates are likely lower than the true prevalence, given the rugged field conditions surrounding oral specimen 
collection from chewed plants and the likelihood of intermittent shedding40. Prevalence of GbbLCV-1 was not 
significantly different among conservation regions, age, sex, or family group (Supplementary Table 1).
The mountain gorilla-specific strain of LCV-1 was also detected in circulating white blood cells in 11 of 15 
adult females, 1 of 2 adult males, 2 of 4 juvenile females, 0 of 1 juvenile males, and 1 of 1 infant females from 
whom blood samples were opportunistically collected. No significant differences were detected between age 
or sex and lymphocryptovirus presence in circulating white blood cells. While the availability of opportunis-
tically collected blood samples was low, the high prevalence of GbbLCV-1 in gorilla oral secretions tested from 
the majority of the habituated population and frequent detection in gorilla peripheral white blood cell samples 
strongly suggest widespread infection with GbbLCV-1 in both mountain gorilla subpopulations.
Patterns of GbbLCV-1 transmission in wild mountain gorillas. 
To determine under what circum-
stances mountain gorillas acquire GbbLCV-1 in the wild, we screened mountain gorillas from all age groups in 
which social structure was well known. Mountain gorillas from the 26 family groups sampled are followed daily 
and their reproductive states and social interactions are recorded. Thus, for the majority of mountain gorillas in 
these groups, their exact date of birth is known. The majority of mountain gorillas shedding GbbLCV-1 were 
infants (samples collected from infants aged 6 months to 3 years of age), suggesting primary infection during this 
stage of life, similar to what is seen in humans in less developed countries41. Fifty-two percent of infant moun-
tain gorillas tested were orally shedding GbbLCV-1 (9/19 Bwindi and 16/29 Virunga gorilla infants; Table 1). 
All live infants sampled in this study appeared to be healthy and thriving, and no morbidity or mortality over 
a one-year post-sampling period was reported indicating that primary infection with GbbLCV-1 in healthy 
infants is asymptomatic or causes mild symptoms, similar to what is documented in human infection during 
infancy4. In addition, mother and infant pairs tended to be strongly correlated in shedding status. Specifically, ten 
mother-infant pairs were both shedding GbbLCV-1 in saliva and six mother-infant pairs were both not shedding 
at the time of sampling, while two mother-infant pairs had only the mother shedding and one mother-infant pair 
had only the infant shedding. Infant GbbLCV-1 shedding status was not significantly different from that of their 
mother’s (McNemar’s P value = 0.5) indicating mothers are most likely the primary source of infection for their 
infants. Mountain gorilla mothers were frequently observed grooming their infants, which could expose them to 
saliva containing lymphocryptovirus. In addition, infants, while still primarily nursing, were frequently observed

both mother and infant were not collected for diagnostic analyses.
Pulmonary reactive lymphoid hyperplasia (PRLH) cases. 
To study the role of lymphocryptoviruses in 
the development of PRLH in mountain gorillas, we examined archived tissue samples from infants demonstrating 
histologic evidence of PRHL at death. Pulmonary reactive lymphoid hyperplasia has been identified in 11 out 
of 62 mountain gorilla infants (17.7%) that died between 1988 and 2013. We examined available post-mortem 
tissues from eight infants that died between 2001 and 2011, which demonstrated histological signs of PRLH. 
Histological lesions included lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia exemplified by diffuse infiltration of the alveolar 
septa by lymphocytes (Fig. 2) and follicular bronchiolitis exemplified by hyperplasia of the bronchial associated 
lymphoid tissue. In all of the infants examined by necropsy in this study, PRLH was incidental to other unrelated 
primary causes of death. One infant had a congenital cleft palate, one was killed due to infanticide, and six died as 
a result of maternal abandonment and exposure. Respiratory signs were not identified in any study infants prior 
to death despite respiratory illness being well-documented in the mountain gorilla population23. Evidence of 
immune dysregulation was present in the form of lymphadenopathy characterized by giant follicular hyperplasia 
in two of these cases and thymic atrophy in two.
Localization of lymphocryptoviruses in infant lung tissues. 
To test the association of PRLH with 
primary lymphocryptovirus infection in gorillas, we compared GbbLCV-1 DNA presence/absence in avail-
able frozen post-mortem tissues from eight infants with histologic evidence of PRLH at death, three infants

gorilla-specific strain of lymphocryptovirus -1 was detected in at least one available tissue type from 5 of 8 
(62.5%) gorillas with histologic evidence of PRLH, including 5 of 7 (71.4%) lung tissue samples with correspond-
ing lung lesions (frozen lung tissue was not available from one PRLH pathology case; Table 2). We did not detect 
GbbLCV-1 in any lung tissue from gorillas without histologic evidence of PRLH (Table 2). Our findings suggest 
an association between GbbLCV-1 infection and development of PRLH in mountain gorillas, similar to the devel-
opment of EBV-related PRLH in humans.

Risk of cross-species transmission of EBV to Eastern gorillas. 
To further evaluate whether extremely 
close human-gorilla contact could lead to cross-species infection with human EBV, in addition to our screening of 
the wild mountain gorilla population (described above), we tested direct oral swab samples from one confiscated 
mountain gorilla and five confiscated eastern lowland gorillas being reared in captivity in very close contact with 
human caregivers. We used the same pan-herpesvirus PCR assays, designed to detect herpesviruses in the alpha, 
beta and gamma subfamilies and the EBV specific PCR assay, for both wild and confiscated gorillas. The potential 
for cross species transmission of viruses by close proximity contact has been previously demonstrated with the 
detection of HSV-1 in one of the captive eastern lowland gorillas in this study28. All six confiscated gorillas were 
orally shedding GbbLCV-1 at the time of sample collection. Gorilla orphans were brought into captivity between 
the approximate ages of 6 months and 3 years and were likely infected with GbbLCV-1 prior to being removed 
from the wild. Human EBV was not detected in these captive gorillas or in any wild gorillas tested in this study 
using our methods.
Discussion
Contrary to previous serologic evidence for ubiquitous EBV exposure in mountain gorillas35, our population-wide 
survey did not detect shedding of EBV in the wild or captivity during our study period and alternatively demon-
strated that the lymphocryptovirus circulating in mountain gorillas is a mountain gorilla-specific strain of lym-
phocryptovirus 1, GbbLCV-1. Epstein-Barr virus serologic assays used previously were likely cross-reactive with 
GbbLCV-1. We also identified multiple epidemiologic and pathologic similarities between GbbLCV-1 and EBV 
including: primary infection during infancy, a likely mother-to-infant transmission pathway via saliva, latent 
infection in peripheral white blood cells, intermittent oral shedding and an association between primary infection 
and the presence of PRLH. Together these similar epidemiologic and pathologic findings suggest that GbbLCV-1 
could be used to gain insight into human disease. While experimental manipulation of mountain gorillas would 
not be feasible or ethical in the wild, information can be gained from noninvasive health studies and pathological 
investigations of deceased individuals, providing valuable information for human disease in a natural great ape 
setting.
Mountain gorilla infants had the highest prevalence of GbbLCV-1 oral shedding compared to other age 
groups. It is likely that infants are protected by maternal antibodies until approximately 6 months of age but 
become infected shortly thereafter when maternal antibodies wane, similar to what has been documented for 
lymphocryptoviruses in rhesus macaques and in humans in less developed countries13, 41. Oral shedding of 
GbbLCV-1 was not detected in any infant under the age of 6 months. In less developed countries, human primary 
infection with EBV typically occurs during infancy through exposure to saliva by close contact with their mothers 
(in part due to the practice of pre-mastication of food for infants) or other family members and is either asymp-
tomatic or results in nonspecific signs of a viral infection2, 3, 42, 43. In developed countries, human primary infec-
tion with EBV typically occurs during adolescence when people begin to be exposed to saliva through contact 
with other adolescents (thus it’s common name as the “kissing disease”), and infection in this age class can cause 
mononucleosis44. In this study, we identified a correlation between mother and infant GbbLCV-1 oral shedding, 
which suggests mothers pass the virus to their infants through infected saliva. Infant mountain gorillas frequently 
explore and chew on discarded food items from their mothers and mother-infant grooming is common; both 
activities which present opportunities for exposure to GbbLCV-1 through saliva.
While the highest prevalence of GbbLCV-1 oral shedding was in infants, lymphocryptovirus was detected in 
all age groups in both oral specimens as well as peripheral white blood cells. We know that after initial infection 
with EBV, the virus remains latent in peripherally infected B lymphocytes45. Detecting GbbLCV-1 in both oral 
specimens and peripheral white blood cells in multiple age groups suggests a similar route of infection and per-
sistence in mountain gorillas.
Our study localized GbbLCV-1 viral DNA to five infant lung tissues demonstrating lesions consistent with 
PRLH. A lymphocryptovirus could not be detected in any negative control mountain gorilla lung tissues. 
Epstein-Barr virus DNA has been associated with PRLH lesions in situ in human case-control studies46. Although 
our sample size of mountain gorilla tissues viable for molecular diagnostics was small, identifying GbbLCV-1 in 
mountain gorilla PRLH lesions together with the knowledge that EBV is associated with PRLH in humans sug-
gests a similar pathogenesis in mountain gorillas. None of the mountain gorilla infants in which PRLH lesions 
were identified showed signs of respiratory illness prior to their death, indicating that PRLH can occur without 
overt clinical signs.
While primate models for human infection with EBV exist in captivity47 and other great ape-specific lymphoc-
ryptoviruses have been identified in wild chimpanzees, western lowland gorillas and orangutans, mountain goril-
las present a more accessible model for lymphocryptovirus epidemiology and pathology in a natural free-ranging 
host. The majority of individuals in the mountain gorilla population are identified by name with researchers and 
park personnel monitoring them daily. More than four decades of data on life histories and behavioral interac-
tions are recorded for these human habituated gorillas48. Until recently, population-wide studies of orally shed 
viruses in mountain gorillas were logistically impossible, limiting virus data to that which could be obtained from 
fecal samples or infrequently collected blood or oral swab samples. With the introduction of chewed plants as a 
way to collect great ape oral samples, mountain gorillas can now be frequently monitored for oral shedding of 
lymphocryptoviruses non-invasively with minimal behavioral disruption38.
In addition, post-mortem infant mountain gorilla tissue samples are opportunistically available, permitting 
investigation of histopathologic lesions associated with primary lymphocryptovirus infection. Infant mountain 
gorilla mortality is high due to the practice of infanticide by adult males and other traumatic and infectious 
causes49, 50. When infants die in the forest, every attempt is made to collect their bodies for necropsy. While only a 
small number of appropriately preserved tissue samples from these necropsies were available for our retrospective

study due to inconsistencies in sample collection and variable length of formalin fixation, investigations into 
infant mortality are ongoing and additional PRLH cases are being identified and investigated.
Paired molecular and histopathologic findings in gorilla infants, in conjunction with the overall high preva-
lence of PRLH in mountain gorilla infant necropsy cases, indicates that histopathologic lesions associated with 
primary infection with a lymphocryptovirus is common in mountain gorilla infants. In contrast, little is known 
about the histopathologic lesions associated with primary infection with EBV in human infants and children for 
whom invasive lung biopsies are rarely performed. In children, in whom PRLH was diagnosed with an open lung 
biopsy, it is usually associated with congenital or acquired immune dysregulation (e.g., Down syndrome, autoim-
mune diseases, and HIV/AIDS)7. Inferring from findings reported here in mountain gorillas, we hypothesize that 
pathology in humans is likely more common than has been reported to date and is more likely to be present in the 
absence of overt clinical signs. Our data warrant further investigation of the frequency of histopathologic lesions 
associated with primary infection with EBV in human infancy.
Among the lymphocryptoviruses detected in mountain gorillas, only sequences similar to GbbLCV-1 were 
detected in this study. Mountain gorillas were either not infected with a mountain gorilla-specific strain of 
lymphocryptovirus-2, or this virus was not detected using our methods. Previous studies have shown that the 
majority of western lowland gorillas infected with GgorLCV-2 were also co-infected with GgorLCV-118. In cases 
of multiple herpesviral infections, degenerate herpesvirus assays can sometimes favor detection of one herpes-
virus over another51. In humans, type 1 EBV is the most prevalent worldwide but type 2 is common in parts of 
Africa52. Type 1 transforms human B cells into lymphoblastoid cell lines much more efficiently than type 2 EBV53. 
Further studies are needed to investigate the presence of a type 2 EBV-like virus in the mountain gorilla popula-
tion. B-cell lymphoma, a cancer that has been associated with EBV infection in humans, has been noted in one 
adult female mountain gorilla and GbbLCV-1 was detected by PCR in a blood clot from this gorilla collected at 
necropsy. Further investigation into naturally occurring cancers in mountain gorillas that may be associated with 
GbbLCV is warranted.
Investigation of herpesviruses can also be used to study primate population structure and migration pat-
terns54. Phylogenetic analysis shows that herpesvirus divergence closely parallels mammalian, and in particular 
primate, speciation55. Interestingly there were very few nucleotide or amino acid sequence differences detected 
between the geographically isolated Bwindi and Virunga mountain gorilla populations. The Bwindi gorillas are 
an allopatric population living a minimum of 25 kilometers from the Virunga gorillas and have certain morpho-
logical and ecological differences but are considered mountain gorillas56, 57. Finding that GbbLCV-1 sequences 
are not significantly different between these two isolated populations is further evidence for their relatively recent 
geographic separation estimated at approximately 5,000 years ago39.
Identifying GbbLCV-1 has important implications for conservation management of the species. Although 
the sample size of captive gorillas for EBV detection was low, the absence of detection of EBV in this population, 
which is in very close contact with humans, as well as the absence of detection of EBV in the wild population, 
which also has contact with humans, suggest that the likelihood of future transmission of EBV to mountain 
gorillas is low. While mountain gorillas are exposed to human EBV in captive as well as in free-ranging set-
tings, broad infection with their own endemic lymphocryptovirus may provide cross-protective immunity 
against infection with human EBV. Many EBV infection trials in nonhuman primates have failed and this may 
be due to cross-protective immunity with EBV related gamma-1-herpesviruses58. Cross-species transmission of 
gamma-herpesviruses between Old World primates and apes is also thought to be a rare event based on a study 
of predator-prey relationships59. In addition, it has been demonstrated that rhesus macaques cannot be infected 
with EBV because of unknown host restriction factors60. Exposure to and infection with EBV therefore at this 
time does not seem to pose a great risk to mountain gorillas in captivity or in the wild.
In conclusion, we provide the first molecular data on the widespread infection of both subpopulations of the 
mountain gorilla with an EBV-like lymphocryptovirus. We also identified an association between PRLH and 
GbbLCV-1 infection in infant mountain gorillas. Mountain gorilla infants should continue to be monitored for 
PRLH cases as well as older age groups for lymphoproliferative disorders that are known to be associated with 
EBV in humans. Mountain gorillas are a unique population, genetically similar to humans and closely monitored 
by researchers, which could be used to examine future patterns of EBV-related oncogenesis in a natural great ape 
setting.
Materials and Methods
Ethics statement. 
The study was approved by the Uganda Wildlife Authority, the Rwanda Development 
Board, and the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of California, Davis (IACUC 
#17504, Public Health Service Animal Assurance #A3433–01, United States Department of Agriculture 
Registration #93-R-0433), and the study was conducted in accordance with the relevant guidelines and 
regulations.
Mountain gorilla sample and data collection. 
Samples were collected from mountain gorillas in 
the Volcanoes National Park in Rwanda and the Mgahinga and Bwindi Impenetrable Forest National Parks in 
Uganda. Chewed plant samples (n = 383) discarded by wild human-habituated mountain gorillas were collected 
from 294 individual mountain gorillas between November 2012 and June 2013, as described previously38.
Whole blood samples were opportunistically collected from human-habituated mountain gorillas between 
October 1997 and July 2008 (n = 15 adult females, n = 2 adult males, n = 4 juvenile females, n = 1 subadult male, 
and n = 1 female infant) while they were anesthetized for treatment of a presumed human-induced illness or 
injury. Tissue samples examined in this study were collected during necropsies of mountain gorillas that died 
in the Volcanoes National Park between 2006 and 2011 (n = 65 tissue samples from 14 individuals). Oral swab

samples were collected and placed in viral transport media (Remel M6™, Thermo Scientific, Lenexa, KS, USA) 
from one orphan mountain gorilla and five eastern lowland gorillas in captivity in Rwanda while they were anes-
thetized for their annual routine health examinations between December 2009 and November 2010. All samples 
were frozen and stored at −
80 °C. All samples were imported to the University of California Davis under CITES 
permit # 13US117181/9.
Sample processing. 
Chewed plant samples were processed according to previously described techniques38. 
DNA was extracted from whole blood samples using DNEasy® blood and tissue kits (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, 
USA). Total nucleic acid was extracted from approximately 100 ug of frozen tissue. Tissue samples collected 
at necropsy were cut into small pieces with scissors disinfected with 10% sodium hypochlorite after handling 
each sample, to prevent DNA cross-contamination between tissues and between animals. Total nucleic acid was 
extracted using the NucliSENS® MiniMAG® system (bioMérieux, Inc.). DNA and total nucleic acid were stored 
at −
80 °Celsius.
Molecular Diagnostics. 
DNA was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect herpesviral DNA 
utilizing degenerative primers amplifying a 450 bp region of the TERM gene and 225 bp region of the DPOL gene. 
Primers for the TERM and DPOL assays were described previously61, 62. Primers used were designed to amplify 
all herpesviruses within the alpha, beta and gamma herpesvirinae subfamilies and were tested in our laboratory 
(unpublished data) as well as in previous studies to determine their ability to detect human herpesviruses, includ-
ing EBV63. Purified sample DNA (2 ul) or products of first-round PCR reactions (1 ul) were used as templates in 
PCR reactions with 25 ul reaction mixture containing 1 μ
M of each PCR primer, 200 μ
M of each deoxynucleotide 
triphosphate, 0.75 units DNA Polymerase AmpliTaq Gold (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and 5% 
DMSO (Signma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). For the TERM assay, in first and second round PCR, the reactions 
were kept at 95 °C for 3 min and then cycled 55 times with 20 sec of denaturation at 95 °C, 30 sec of annealing 
at 48 °C and 30 sec of strand extension at 72 °C, followed by a final extension step at 72 °C for 10 min. For the 
DPOL assay the conditions were the same except that the annealing temperature was reduced to 46 °C. In order 
to confirm the absence of EBV, samples testing positive for a gorilla herpesvirus by degenerative herpes PCR 
assays were also screened using an EBV specific PCR assay using previously described primers for a fragment 
of the EBV DPOL gene64. PCR reactions were the same as described for degenerative assays with the exception 
of omitting DMSO. Reactions were kept at 95 °C for 3 min and then cycled 50 times with 20 sec of denaturation 
at 95 °C, 30 sec of annealing at 62 °C and 30 sec of strand extension at 72 °C, followed by a final extension step 
at 72 °C for 10 min. In addition, a representative subset of samples from gorillas from both the Virunga Massif 
and Bwindi Impenetrable Forest were analyzed by PCR to detect a fragment of the gB gene (509 bp) to generate 
larger sequences for phylogenetic analysis. Primers for the gB gene were described previously18 and PCR con-
ditions were the same as described for the DPOL assay. Parallel reactions were run for all samples amplifying a 
fragment of the mammalian beta-actin gene to test sample quality. PCR products of appropriate size were cloned 
using TOPO® TA cloning kits (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), and sequencing was performed using Sanger 
sequencing at the University of California, Davis DNA sequencing laboratory. Sequences were compared to other 
published herpesviral sequences in the GenBank Database (National Center for Biotechnology Information, 
National Library of Medicine, Bethesda, Maryland, USA). Sequences were edited using Geneious version 7.0.6. 
Alignments were constructed using CLUSTAL W, executed through Geneious.
Histological Diagnostics. 
Tissues collected at necropsy were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin. 
Fixation time was prolonged, up to more than a year in some cases, pending receipt of permits for importation 
into the United States. Fixed tissues were processed routinely for wax embedment and sectioning at 5 microns. 
Sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and examined by light microscopy by a board certified 
veterinary pathologist (LJL).
Statistical analysis. 
Wild mountain gorillas were divided into age classes: infants were defined as gorillas 
less than three years of age, juveniles as three to five years, subadults as six to seven years and adults as eight years 
and older65, 66. A total of 332 samples (out of 383) were included in statistical analyses (11 samples could not be 
properly assigned to an age group); samples that tested negative for herpesviruses but were also negative for mam-
malian beta-actin were excluded from statistical calculations because inadequate collection of quality sample 
material could not be ruled out for these samples. Period prevalence and 95% binomial exact confidence inter-
vals (CI)67 for oral shedding of lymphocryptovirus were calculated across age class. Finite population correction 
factor was not used because sampling was conducted with replacement. Evaluation of the effects of conservation 
area, family group, age, and sex on gorilla lymphocryptovirus oral shedding was performed by both bivariate 
analysis using a 2-sided chi-square test and a mixed-effects logistic regression model68, 69. Associations between 
lymphocryptovirus detected in whole blood and potential risk factors, such as age and sex, as well as associations 
between lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia status and lymphocryptovirus detected in lung and non-lung tissues 
were evaluated using a Fisher’s exact test70. Association between oral lymphocryptovirus shedding in infants and 
their mothers was evaluated by using a McNemar’s test71. All statistical analyses were performed using STATA 
version 13.172.
