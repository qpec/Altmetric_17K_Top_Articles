An estimated 1.1 million high school and 75,000 college 
athletes participate in tackle football annually in the United 
States. Football is a collision sport; traumatic injuries are 
frequent (1,2), and can be fatal (3). This report updates the 
incidence and characteristics of deaths caused by traumatic 
brain injury and spinal cord injury (4) in high school and 
college football and presents illustrative case descriptions. 
Information was analyzed from the National Center for 
Catastrophic Sport Injury Research (NCCSIR). During 2005–
2014, a total of 28 deaths (2.8 deaths per year) from traumatic 
brain and spinal cord injuries occurred among high school 
(24 deaths) and college football players (four deaths) combined. 
Most deaths occurred during competitions and resulted from 
tackling or being tackled. All four of the college deaths and 14 
(58%) of the 24 high school deaths occurred during the last 5 
years (2010–2014) of the 10-year study period. These findings 
support the need for continued surveillance and safety efforts 
(particularly during competition) to ensure proper tackling 
techniques, emergency planning for severe injuries, availability 
of medical care onsite during competitions, and assessment that 
it is safe to return to play following a concussion.
NCCSIR has been conducting catastrophic injury 
surveillance at the national level for high school and collegiate 
football since 1965 (5) and for all sports since 1982 (6). Deaths 
were identified through ongoing and systematic monitoring 
of public media sources (e.g., online search engines and news 
search engines) and individual reports from national and 
state-level organizations, clinicians, school authorities, and 
researchers. Once a death was identified, NCCSIR researchers 
contacted family members or school staff members to gather 
additional details. When possible, NCCSIR obtained medical 
examiner reports. Information was collected about the athlete’s 
age and level of play; player position and activity; and injury 
type, medical care, and cause of death.
The events included in this study were defined as fatal 
traumatic brain and spinal cord injuries that occurred during 
a scheduled team activity (game, practice, or conditioning 
session) and were directly related to football-specific activities 
(e.g., tackling or being tackled). Each fatality report was 
manually reviewed for inclusion and classification. Fatality 
rates per 1 million players were calculated using National 
Federation of State High School Associations and National 
Collegiate Athletic Association participation statistics as the 
denominators. The causes and potential strategies to prevent 
these injuries were described in association with the 10 Haddon 
energy damage countermeasures (7). All procedures were 
reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of 
the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
During 2005–2014, a total of 24 high school and four 
college football–related traumatic brain and spinal cord injury 
fatalities were identified, for a combined average of 2.8 fatalities 
per year. Among the 24 high school fatalities (Table 1), 22 
(92%) involved head/brain injuries. All four college fatalities 
involved a brain injury. Subdural hematoma was the most 
common diagnosis for both high school and college fatalities 
(46% overall). Four (18%) of the 22 high school players who 
died from brain injuries had sustained a concussion within 
4 weeks of the event, and second impact syndrome (in which a 
second concussion occurs before a first concussion has properly 
healed, causing rapid and severe brain swelling) was implicated 
in three of these four events.
Among the 24 high school fatalities (Table 1), 20 (83%) 
occurred during a game and during the regular season; 17 
(71%) involved tackling or being tackled. Among the four 
college fatalities, two occurred during a regular season game, 
and two occurred during spring football. The most common 
player positions among those fatally injured were running 
back (32% of players overall) and linebacker (21%). Of the 
28 deaths, head first/head down contact was identified in 
eight deaths. Six illustrative cases provide associations with 
the Haddon energy damage countermeasures and extensions 
to football recommendations for preventing traumatic brain 
and spinal cord fatalities (Table 2).
The average number of high school deaths per year was 2.4 
(standard deviation [SD] = 2.2) and ranged from zero to seven 
deaths annually. The average number of deaths among college 
players per year was 0.4 (SD = 0.7) and ranged from zero to 
two deaths annually. For 2 years (2007 and 2012) of the 10-year 
study period, no traumatic brain or spinal cord injury deaths 
were reported among either high school or college football 
players. Fatality rates over the study period were 5.96 fatalities 
per 1 million college football players (95% confidence interval 
[CI] = 0.12–11.81) and 2.18 fatalities per 1 million high school 
football players (CI = 1.31–3.06) (Figure). All four of the college 
deaths and 14 (58%) of the 24 high school deaths occurred 
during the last 5 years (2010–2014) of the 10-year study period.

Discussion
The finding of an annual average of 2.8 brain and spinal cord 
injury deaths for high school and college football combined is 
consistent with a previous report of 3.1 brain injury fatalities 
annually during 1990–2010 (4). Also consistent with previous 
studies (3,4), most brain and spinal cord injury deaths occurred 
during competition, among players at running back and 
linebacker positions, and as a result of tackling or being tackled.
Head first/head down contact was identified as contributing 
to eight of the 28 deaths. This emphasizes the importance of 
instruction in proper tackling techniques (both delivery and 
receipt of tackles) for all players, but particularly for running 
backs, linebackers, and defensive backs. A previous evaluation 
of football tackling programs among youth league football 
players indicated a reduction in concussions in practice and 
games when education of coaches was combined with practice 
contact restrictions (8), providing evidence that these programs 
might have a positive impact on reducing nonfatal head injuries 
among youth league players. However, it is unclear whether older 
players who learned high risk methods can be retrained in new 
techniques. Football is a collision sport played at high velocity, 
and players must act and react quickly. In such situations, new 
techniques might be difficult to deploy, resulting in players 
possibly reverting to past behaviors and reactions unless coaches 
routinely intervene to correct their technique.
The finding that 18% of high school players with fatal 
traumatic brain injuries had a concussion <4 weeks earlier is 
consistent with a previous study that found 16% of football 
players who died from traumatic brain injuries over a 20-year 
period had a previous concussion within 30 days of death (4). 
This finding supports the importance of recognition, reporting, 
management, and adherence to recommended return-to-play 
protocols after a concussion. All 50 states and the District of 
Columbia currently have concussion education and safety 
laws in place that include appropriate medical evaluation by a 
trained medical professional, no same-day return to play, and 
return to play only after medical clearance. All laws include 
education for various stakeholders about concussion symptoms 
and management. However, for the laws to be effective, 
athletes must report their concussion symptoms, and medical 
professionals must be able to accurately assess symptom 
resolution and full recovery from the concussion before 
allowing an athlete to resume contact. The implementation and 
impact of these laws are an important area for future inquiry.
The cases described in this report illustrate the importance 
of emergency preparedness, recognition, and access to medical 
services. All schools should have written emergency action 
plans specific to their school and venue that are rehearsed 
annually by coaches and staff (9). The availability of medical 
professionals onsite who are trained to recognize and act in 
emergency situations is critical in catastrophic football injury 
events. Many schools employ certified athletic trainers, and 
for competitions, have emergency medical services onsite. 
However, nationally, 30% of public high schools do not have 
access to an athletic trainer, and 50% do not have athletic 
trainers present at practices (10). One of the deaths in this 
report occurred during a junior varsity football scrimmage

Blocking Kickoff 
coverage
Regular 
season 
game
A high school player aged 16 years was injured at the end of 
the second quarter of the game while blocking on a kickoff 
return. The athlete lowered his helmet into the chest of 
an opponent and appeared unconscious when he hit the 
ground. He was immediately attended to by emergency 
medical services and transported by ambulance to a 
hospital. Surgery was performed to relieve pressure on the 
brain, but the player never recovered consciousness. He died 
1 week following the injury. Cause of death was a traumatic 
brain injury.
1. Prevent the creation of the hazard: Ban head 
first contact, regardless of intention, enforce 
ban. 4. Modify the rate or spatial distribution 
of the hazard from its source: Decrease the 
closing distance on kickoffs. 8. Make what is to 
be protected more resistant to damage from the 
hazard: Provide universal education about proper 
technique for blocking, strengthen neck muscles.

A high school player aged 16 years was injured during 
the second quarter of the game. He collapsed on the 
sideline after being tackled while carrying the ball. He was 
transported to a hospital and died the next day. He had 
received a concussion in practice 2 days before the game, 
and it is unclear whether he had clearance from a physician 
to return to play. Cause of death was a traumatic brain injury 
resulting from second impact syndrome.
5. Separate by time or space the hazard from 
that which can be protected: Return concussed 
athletes to play only when symptom free, following 
a graduated return to play progression, and when 
fully healed (prevent second impact syndrome).

Spring 
football
A college player aged 21 years was injured during a spring 
season game. He was injured on the last play of the game 
while making a tackle and taking a blow to the head. 
He suffered an acute subdural hematoma. He walked 
off the field, but began vomiting on the sideline. He was 
immediately attended to by the athletic trainer, and 
emergency medical services were summoned. He was taken 
to a regional hospital and flown by helicopter to a trauma 
center, where he later died.

A college player aged 22 years was participating in football 
drills during practice when he collapsed. He was taken to a 
regional medical center and flown by helicopter to a trauma 
center, where a diagnosis was made of severe head trauma 
and swelling of the brain. He died several days later after 
multiple surgeries. Reports indicated that his forehead had 
been bleeding for 2 days prior as a result of a previously 
sustained head injury. He returned to practice despite 
complaints of a headache and dizziness.

Tackling Lineman
Regular 
season 
game
A high school football player who was a junior sustained 
an injury during a game with the possibility of head-
on-head contact during a kick return. He walked off 
the field at halftime and shortly afterward collapsed 
and lost consciousness. Police onsite called emergency 
medical services; there was no ambulance at the game. 
Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was administered upon the 
arrival of the emergency medical services unit, and he was 
transported by ambulance to a local hospital 18 miles away 
when he was unable to be stabilized for helicopter transport. 
He died shortly afterward at the hospital. Preliminary cause 
of death was blunt force trauma to the head.
1. (see above) 8. (see above) 9. Move rapidly 
to detect and evaluate the damage that has 
occurred and counter its continuation and 
extension: Implement an emergency action plan 
and provide emergency medical services onsite for 
games. 10. (see above)

Tackling Cornerback
Regular 
season 
game
A high school player aged 16 years collapsed after making a 
“routine” tackle during a junior varsity scrimmage against a 
visiting team. Witnesses to the event reported that his head 
was up when he made the tackle and that his head hit his 
opponent’s chest. Coaches and adults responded and found 
he was not breathing. They telephoned emergency medical 
services, which took 15 minutes to arrive at the suburban 
school. Emergency medical services began cardiopulmonary 
resuscitation and transported the player to the hospital, 
where he died shortly afterward. Autopsy confirmed C-3 
cervical fracture from blunt force head and neck trauma.

when emergency medical services were not onsite and arrival 
of emergency medical services took 15 minutes because of 
traffic. Current best practices include access to athletic trainers 
for practices and competition and maintaining emergency 
medical services onsite during competitions (9).
The findings in this report are subject to at least four 
limitations. First, most events were captured through 
publicly available media sources, and it is possible that some 
football deaths were missed. Second, football participation 
numbers are representative of National Federation of State 
High School Associations and National Collegiate Athletic 
Association-affiliated schools and likely underestimate the 
actual number of football participants. Third, whenever 
possible, medical diagnoses and medical examiner report 
causes of death were used, however, the exact diagnosis 
was unknown for seven of the traumatic brain injury 
deaths. Information availability might be hampered by the 
sensitivity surrounding a fatal event, potential litigation, 
and inability to talk with persons involved. Finally, public 
interest and media attention about sport-related deaths 
and traumatic brain injuries increased during the study 
period, and it is unknown how this might have affected the 
identification of fatal injuries over time.
These findings support continued surveillance and safety 
efforts to ensure proper tackling techniques, emergency 
planning, and medical care, particularly during competi-
tion, and adherence to protocols for safe return-to-play after 
a concussion. These measures will also reduce the risk for 
concussion and improve treatment and management after 
a concussion is sustained. CDC provides emergency action 
plan templates and guidance (https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/
docs/2004-101/emrgact/emrgact1.html) and information 
about concussions through the CDC HEADS UP program 
(https://www.cdc.gov/headsup/). Information on state laws 
related to concussions is available at https://www.ncsl.org/

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Fatalities resulting from catastrophic brain and spinal cord 
injuries occur infrequently among high school and college 
football players.
What is added by this report?
During 2005–2014, a total of 28 traumatic brain and spinal cord 
injury deaths in high school and college football were identified 
(2.8 deaths per year). The most common playing positions of 
those fatally injured were running back and linebacker. 
Approximately 18% of identified high school brain injury deaths 
were preceded by an earlier concussion, which might have led 
to second impact syndrome.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Implementing enhanced safety measures to prevent fatalities 
from catastrophic brain and spinal cord injuries among high 
school and college football players has the potential to reduce 
the number of these fatalities. Continued surveillance is 
important to monitor the circumstances of these deaths and 
develop risk scenarios to improve prevention measures.
