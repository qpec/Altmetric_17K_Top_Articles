Purpose:
The Argus II Retinal Prosthesis System (Second Sight Medical Products, Inc, Sylmar, CA) was
developed to restore some vision to patients blind as a result of retinitis pigmentosa (RP) or outer retinal
degeneration. A clinical trial was initiated in 2006 to study the long-term safety and efficacy of the Argus II System
in patients with bare or no light perception resulting from end-stage RP.
Design:
Prospective, multicenter, single-arm clinical trial. Within-patient controls included the nonimplanted
fellow eye and patients’ native residual vision compared with their vision with the Argus II.
Participants:
Thirty participants in 10 centers in the United States and Europe.
Methods:
The worse-seeing eye of blind patients was implanted with the Argus II. Patients wore glasses
mounted with a small camera and a video processor that converted images into stimulation patterns sent to the
electrode array on the retina.
Main Outcome Measures:
The primary outcome measures were safety (the number, seriousness, and
relatedness of adverse events) and visual function, as measured by 3 computer-based, objective tests. Sec-
ondary measures included functional vision performance on objectively scored real-world tasks.
Results:
Twenty-four of 30 patients remained implanted with functioning Argus II Systems at 5 years after
implantation. Only 1 additional serious adverse event was experienced after the 3-year time point. Patients
performed significantly better with the Argus II on than off on all visual function tests and functional vision
tasks.
Conclusions:
The 5-year results of the Argus II trial support the long-term safety profile and benefit of the
Argus II System for patients blind as a result of RP. The Argus II is the first and only retinal implant to have market
approval in the European Economic Area, the United States, and Canada. Ophthalmology 2016;123:2248-

The last decade has seen a significant number of new
retinal treatment paradigms commencing clinical trials.
These
have
included
gene
therapy,1
stem
cell
transplantation,2
and
electronic
neural
prostheses
in
different locations in the eye.3e5 Although all of these
approaches hold promise, only retinal prostheses have
reached the market for the restoration of some visual
function in patients blind as a result of retinitis pigmentosa
(RP). The Argus II Retinal Prosthesis System (Second
Sight Medical Products, Inc, Sylmar, CA) was the first and
remains 1 of only 2 retinal prostheses to be approved for
commercialization
in
the
European
Economic
Area
(receiving CE Mark in 2011) and the only prosthesis to
date to receive Food and Drug Administration approval for
commercialization in the United States (Humanitarian
Device Exemption approval in 2013) and to receive Health
Canada approval (in 2014).
Thirty patients implanted with the Argus II System for
the Argus II feasibility study (clinicaltrials.gov identifier,
NCT00407602) are being followed for 10 years in a long-
term follow-up clinical study. All enrolled patients now
have reached at least 5 years after implantation; this report
includes safety and efficacy data for all enrolled patients for
that period.

 Methods
The Argus II System
The Argus II Retinal Prosthesis System is a visual prosthesis with
implanted and external components (Fig 1). Patients wear a pair of
glasses with a small camera mounted in the frame connected via a
cable to a video processing unit worn on the belt or on a shoulder
strap.
Implanted
components
include
a
hermetically
sealed
enclosure for the electronics that, along with a receiving antenna,
is secured to the eye with a scleral band and sutures, and an
array of 60 electrodes that is inserted into the eye and tacked
over the macula. When the system is turned on, the visual
information collected by the camera is received, processed, and
converted into a brightness map in real time by the video
processing unit. Power and data are sent via a radio-frequency
telemetry link from an external antenna on the glasses to the
receiving antenna on the eye. The brightness values in the video are
converted into stimulation current amplitudes on each of the 60
electrodes; activated retinal neurons produce action potentials that
travel through the remaining visual system and are perceived as
patterns of light by the patients.
Surgical Procedure
The Argus II was implanted in the worse-seeing eye of each pa-
tient. The surgical procedure has been reported in detail else-
where6,7; herein, we provide a summary of the main steps. A 360�
limbal conjunctival peritomy was performed. The receiving coil
was inserted under the lateral rectus muscle and extended into the
inferotemporal quadrant, whereas the electronics case was placed
in the superotemporal quadrant. The scleral band continued under
the inferior, medial, and superior rectus muscles. Suture tabs on the
implant allowed fixation of the implant to the sclera, and a Watzke
sleeve (Labtician Ophthalmics, Inc, Oakville, Canada) and mattress
sutures or scleral tunneling secured the scleral band in the nasal
quadrants. Core and peripheral vitrectomies were performed, and a
temporal sclerotomy of approximately 5 mm was made to allow the
introduction of the 60-electrode array into the eye. The array was
placed over the macula and tacked to the retina with a custom-
made, spring-tension, metallic tack (Second Sight Medical Prod-
ucts, Inc). The trans-scleral passage of the cable was sealed with
sutures, and all other sclerotomies were closed. An allograft
(processed pericardium; aponeurosis in France) was sutured over
the implant to reduce the risk of conjunctival irritation or erosion,
and the Tenon’s capsule and conjunctiva were closed.
Study Design
The Argus II clinical trial was a prospective, single-arm, non-
randomized study. A sample size of 30 was chosen as sufficient for
an analysis of safety and efficacy, taking into account the rarity of
the disease under study, RP; estimated prevalence is approximately
1 in 4000 people in developed countries. There were no sham
surgeries and all patients were implanted with the Argus II.
Inclusion criteria included: bare light perception or worse vision
(>2.9 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution [logMAR]) in
both eyes resulting from profound RP (in the United States) or
outer retinal degeneration (in Europe); a history of useful form
vision; intact and functioning optic nerve; and 50 years of age or
older (later in the trial, this criterion was changed to 25 years or
older in the United States and Switzerland and 18 years or older in
the United Kingdom and France). Exclusion criteria included:
diseases or conditions that may have prevented successful im-
plantation (e.g., axial length out of a certain range) or may have
prevented the device from working correctly (e.g., damaged optic
nerve function). The trial was and continues to be conducted in
accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the national reg-
ulations for medical device clinical trials in the respective countries
where the study is being conducted: the United States, the United
Kingdom, France, and Switzerland. The study has been approved
by the national ministries of health in these countries and the ethics
committees or institutional review boards of participating in-
stitutions. All patients signed informed consent to participate. The
clinical trial is posted on www.clinicaltrials.gov (where full in-
clusion and exclusion criteria can be found) under trial registration
number NCT00407602.
End Points
The trial end points, summarized here, have been described in
detail elsewhere.6e9 The primary end point for safety was the rate,
type, and severity of adverse events (AEs) that were related to the
surgery or the device. All AEs were collected and reported as
necessary to the relevant authorities and ethics committees and
received detailed review and adjudication by an independent
medical safety monitor. Serious adverse events (SAEs) were
distinguished as a subset of AEs according to the regulatory defi-
nition. In this trial, events adjudicated as serious met the criteria of
“necessitated medical or surgical intervention to preclude perma-
nent impairment or damage to a body structure” or “required
hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization.” Nonserious AEs
required no treatment or only noninvasive treatment. Thus, a single
type of event such as hypotony could be classified as either serious
or nonserious depending on how or where it was treated.
Information about device reliability, stability, and robustness
over time was gathered by tracking the number of device failures.

 Data on partial or complete explantation of devices also were
captured. Follow-up visits after explantation were performed at 1
day, 1 week, 4 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after
explantation except as noted below. Visits after explantation
included eye examination, retinal photography, ocular coherence
tomography, and fluorescein angiography.
The primary end point for efficacy was visual function, as
measured by 3 custom-designed objective assessments. Square
localization measured the ability to locate and touch a high-contrast
white square of light on a black background on a touch screen
monitor; direction of motion assessed patients’ ability to determine
and indicate the direction of a high-contrast bar that moved across
the monitor; and grating visual acuity measured patients’ visual
acuity using square-wave gratings of different spatial frequencies
presented on a computer monitor. All assessments were performed
with the Argus II turned on and off (with patients’ residual vision
onlydbinocularly for square localization and direction of motion
and monocularly for grating visual acuity). Masking of patients
was not possible because of the visual and auditory cues produced
by the Argus II when turned on.
Square localization and direction of motion were analyzed in
terms of their mean error (the difference between the stimulus and
response, in centimeters and degrees, respectively). For the analysis
as a group, results from all patients were pooled at each time point,
such that mean error indicated the overall performance of the group.
For individual analyses, a 2-tailed t test assuming unequal variances
indicated whether the mean error with the system turned on was
significantly different from system off for each patient (P < 0.05).
Grating visual acuity was measured on a scale of 2.9 to 1.6 logMAR.
Patients who performed no better than chance at 2.9 logMAR were
scored worse than 2.9 logMAR. The percentage of patients who
scored better than 2.9 logMAR was compared for the 2 conditions.
Secondary end points included the door task, a real-world assess-
ment in which patients attempted to walk to and touch a large piece of
contrasting felt (simulating a door) on a wall; the line task, in which
patients followed a white line painted on black tiles; the mass of ac-
tivity inventory, a questionnaire designed to measure changes in
functional vision; the functional low-vision observer-rated assess-
ment, an assessment performed by trained low-vision rehabilitation
specialists; and the vision-related quality of life questionnaire,
designed to measure the quality of life of those with vision impair-
ments. The functional low-vision observer-rated assessment and
vision-related quality of life questionnaire were performed only
through postimplant year 3 (as per the clinical trial protocol), and the
functional low-vision observer-rated assessment has been described
and reported elsewhere.10,11 The activity inventory was not validated
fully in this patient population (e.g., with very low-vision patients),
and as such, the data are not included in this report. The door and line
tasks were scored by percent success, that is, the mean percent of
correct responses (touching the door or ending at the line) for the
system on and off was calculated over the group.
Results
Patient Demographics
Enrollment of 30 patients at 10 centers was completed in 26
months (between June 2007 and August 2009), including a pause
in enrollment of approximately 6 months after the first 15 patients
were implanted. Basic demographics are shown in Table 1.
Patients Lost to Follow-up
No patients were lost to follow-up completely as of 5 years after
implantation. However, the number of patients included in the
analysis of safety and efficacy did decline over time. Safety data
were gathered to 5 years for 27 patients, with drop-out occurring
for explanted patients at 1.2 years, 3.5 years, and 4.3 years. Per-
formance data were gathered for 21 or 20 patients at 5 years after
implantation as described later.
Safety
Previous reports presented SAE data at 1 year and 3 years after
implantation.6,7 Here, we reprint the 0- to 3-year cumulative SAE
rates and report SAEs that occurred up to 5 years after implantation
(Table 2). As of 5 years after implantation, 60% of patients (18/30)
had experienced no device- or surgery-related SAEs. There were
24 SAEs among 12 patients. (See Table S1, available online at
www.aaojournal.org, for SAE occurrences per post-implant year.)
All SAEs were treatable with standard ophthalmic approaches,
and there were no lost eyes (enucleated) in the study. As shown in
Table 2, only 1 additional SAE had occurred up to year 5 since the
last analysis at 3 years after implantation. A rhegmatogenous
retinal detachment was noted in the implanted eye of 1 patient
during a routine follow-up visit approximately 4.5 years after im-
plantation. The detachment remained stable for more than 1 year,
when neovascular glaucoma associated with rubeosis was noted.
Medication did not decrease the intraocular pressure. Thus, the
patient underwent a pars plana vitrectomy, removal of an epiretinal
membrane, fluideair exchange, and injection of silicone oil. Two
weeks after surgery, the intraocular pressure returned to normal and
the rubeosis and retinal detachment resolved. One patient died at 6
years after implantation of natural causes unrelated to the Argus II.
Device Reliability and Stability
As of 5 years after implantation, 2 Argus II implants had failed,
both because of a progressive loss of ability to maintain the radio-
frequency link between the external antenna on the glasses and the
receiving antenna implanted on the eye. Both devices failed at
approximately 4 years after implantation. The failures are believed
to be the result of a gradual exposure of a portion of the receiving
antenna, possibly because of damage during surgery. The devices
remained implanted to continue collecting long-term safety data for
the duration of the clinical trial; thus, the root causes cannot be
confirmed at this time.
Device Explantations
There were 3 complete or partial explantations. In 1 patient, as
previously reported,7 the implant was removed at 14 months to

 resolve recurrent conjunctival erosion. Two additional patients
requested that their devices be explanted at 3.5 and 4.3 years
after implantation. One of these patients had experienced 2
conjunctival erosions that were treated by resuturing the device
and closing the conjunctiva. A third instance of conjunctival
erosion occurred and the patient chose explantation rather than
undergoing a third revision surgery. The entire implant was
removed
with
no
serious
adverse
sequelae.
This
patient
completed follow-up after explantation through 3 months and
withdrew study consent at that point. The other patient experienced
chronic hypotony and ptosis in the implanted eye and chose
explantation for aesthetic reasons and to avoid additional revision
surgeries. During the explantation procedure, the cable was cut mid
vitreous, the sclerotomy was sutured completely closed, and the
extraocular portion of the device and the proximal portion of the
cable were removed. The array was left tacked to the retina. No
AEs occurred after explantation.
Visual Function
Mean results over time for visual function tasks are shown in
Figure 2. The number of patients included in the analysis for each
time point is indicated in the axis label. Square localization and
direction of motion were introduced partway through the study,
so baseline and year 1 follow-up results do not represent a com-
plete data set. Later time points also include fewer patients because
of the explantations and device failures described above, as well as
a few instances of missed protocol visits in years 4 and 5. Missed
visits were the result of health reasons (n ¼ 1), method deviation
(n ¼ 1), and consent to safety follow-up only after year 3 or 4
(n ¼ 2). One additional patient did not complete the direction of
motion, line task, or door task at year 5 because of fatigue.
As a group, patients perform better on the square localization
test with the system on (lower mean error) than when using their
residual vision at all time points (Fig 2A). Direction of motion, a
more challenging assessment, also showed overall improvement
(lower mean error) with the system on at all time points
(Fig 2B). Grating visual acuity, the most difficult assessment,
also revealed better performance with the system on; with the
system off, all results were worse than 2.9 logMAR at yearly
time points. With the system on, 27% to 48% of patients scored
2.9 logMAR or better (Fig 2C), depending on the time point.
The patients’ improvements when using the system compared
with their residual vision also can be seen on an individual basis, in
terms of the percentage of patients who performed significantly
better with the system on than off on each assessment. Results at 1
year and 3 years were reported previously; here, the year 3 and year
5 results are compared (Table 3).
Functional Vision
The mean percent success for the orientation and mobility
assessments is shown in Figure 3. Performance on the door task
was better with the system on than off at all time points
(Fig 3A). Similarly, patients’ ability to follow a white line on the
floor was much improved when using the system compared with
using only their residual vision (Fig 3B).
Discussion
The Argus II was granted regulatory approval in the Euro-
pean Economic Area in 2011 and in the United States in
2013 on the basis of earlier results from this clinical trial.
However, the original study patients will continue to be
followed up out to 10 years to collect very long-term data on
the safety and efficacy of this chronically implanted device.
Long-term data are ever more important given that the de-
vice is becoming available to increasingly large numbers of
patients with RP and similar disorders worldwide.
The data from the original group of 30 patientsd15 of
whom received an earlier design of the device before minor
improvements
were
made7dcontinue
to
show
clear
reliability, safety, and long-term efficacy out to 5 years af-
ter implantation. Twenty-four devices remain implanted and
functioning. The device stability remains good with only 2
device failures, both of which remain safely implanted but
nonfunctional, and 3 explanted devices from among 30
implanted patients. Of the 3 explantations, 1 was carried out
to resolve recurrent conjunctival erosion and chronic
hypotony. The other 2 explantations were elected by the
patients. Although elective, these 2 explantations were
prompted by a cascade of SAEs in each patient that have
been documented previously.7 In these cases, the patients
chose explantation rather than further revision surgeries to
address recurrent SAEs. One patient died during the trial.

 Only 1 new SAE developed between 3 and 5 years after
implantation, a rhegmatogenous retinal detachment that was
treated successfully and resolved. There were no lost eyes
and there was no damaged residual vision in the study.
However, it is clear that any chronic implant in the eye
carries a continual risk of SAEs. Although outside the scope
of this article, additional instances of SAEs were found in 4
patients after the 5-year time point. In 2 patients, these
represented recurrences or worsening of previous SAEs; in 2
patients, they were new events (conjunctival erosion and

 rhegmatogenous retinal detachment in another patient).
These will be reported in a future article when the dataset is
complete and events have been adjudicated. Therefore, it is
critical for any patient considering being implanted with the
Argus II to understand the long-term and ongoing risks;
both the patient and his or her ophthalmologist must commit
to at least a yearly evaluation of eye health for as long as the
Argus II remains implanted.
Results on a battery of visual function and functional
vision assessments indicated continued efficacy of the Argus
II out to 5 years after implantation. Patients are still able to
locate objects, determine the direction of motion of a
moving bar, and perform an acuity task better with the
system on than when using only residual vision. The 5-year
visual function results are similar to those seen at 3 years,
particularly when considering the individual analysis data
(e.g., 33% of patients performed grating acuity better with
the system on than off at 3 years, and 38% did so at 5 years).
Functional vision performance likewise showed sustained
improvement with the system on out to 5 years after im-
plantation. It should be noted that 9 to 10 patients did not
participate in efficacy testing during the 5-year follow-up
period as discussed previously. The resulting smaller
numbers may have led to bias in the results at later time
points. This potential bias will be evaluated in future reports,
such as those on the postapproval studies currently in
progress.
In conclusion, as of October 15, 2015, more than 200
patient-years of data had been collected on the 30 patients
implanted with the Argus II Retinal Prosthesis System. The
longest implant duration to date is 8.4 years, and this device
as well as 23 others continue to function, reliably enhancing
basic visual function for these patients who otherwise can
see almost nothing. The outcome of the functional tests
described in this report and the acceptable safety profile of
the Argus II in this clinical trial led to its regulatory
approval in the European Union, the United States, and
Canada. The device has gone on to be implanted in many
patients; in many countries, it remains the only currently
available treatment for profound vision loss resulting from
RP and outer retinal dystrophy. These new long-term data
from the original study continue to demonstrate that this
therapy remains an option for patients with RP and may
allow for stable and reliable restoration of some basic visual
function.
