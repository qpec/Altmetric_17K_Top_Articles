Multifocal repetitive TMS for motor and
mood symptoms of Parkinson disease
A randomized trial
ABSTRACT
Objective: To assess whether multifocal, high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimula-
tion (rTMS) of motor and prefrontal cortex benefits motor and mood symptoms in patients with
Parkinson disease (PD).
Methods: Patients with PD and depression were enrolled in this multicenter, double-blind, sham-
controlled, parallel-group study of real or realistic (electric) sham rTMS. Patients were randomized
to 1 of 4 groups: bilateral M1 ( 1 sham dorsolateral prefrontal cortex [DLPFC]), DLPFC ( 1 sham
M1), M1 1 DLPFC, or double sham. The TMS course consisted of 10 daily sessions of 2,000
stimuli for the left DLPFC and 1,000 stimuli for each M1 (50 3 4-second trains of 40 stimuli at
10 Hz). Patients were evaluated at baseline, at 1 week, and at 1, 3, and 6 months after treatment.
Primary endpoints were changes in motor function assessed with the Unified Parkinson’s Disease
Rating Scale-III and in mood with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale at 1 month.
Results: Of the 160 patients planned for recruitment, 85 were screened, 61 were randomized,
and 50 completed all study visits. Real M1 rTMS resulted in greater improvement in motor func-
tion than sham at the primary endpoint (p , 0.05). There was no improvement in mood in the
DLPFC group compared to the double-sham group, as well as no benefit to combining M1 and
DLPFC stimulation for either motor or mood symptoms.
Conclusions: In patients with PD with depression, M1 rTMS is an effective treatment of motor
symptoms, while mood benefit after 2 weeks of DLPFC rTMS is not better than sham. Targeting
both M1 and DLPFC in each rTMS session showed no evidence of synergistic effects.
ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01080794.
Classification of evidence: This study provides Class I evidence that in patients with PD with
depression, M1 rTMS leads to improvement in motor function while DLPFC rTMS does not lead
to improvement in depression compared to sham rTMS. Neurology® 2016;87:1907–1915

Parkinson disease (PD) presents with both motor and nonmotor features. Motor symptoms can
respond to pharmacologic and other therapies such as deep brain stimulation,1 but these treat-
ments are often ineffective for nonmotor symptoms. Depression is particularly common, with
a prevalence ranging from 40% to 70%.2 Not infrequently, depression in PD is resistant to
medication and affects patients’ quality of life.3

 One treatment with the potential to improve
both motor and mood symptoms in PD is repet-
itive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS),
a noninvasive brain stimulation modality that
changes cortical excitability that persists beyond
the stimulation session itself.4–6 High-frequency
(HF) rTMS to the bilateral primary motor cortex
(M1) has been shown to improve motor
symptoms in PD,7–10 while HF rTMS to the left
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is an
effective treatment for medication-refractory
depression,4,11,12 including depression in PD.13–16
Despite the frequent comorbidity of mood
and motor symptoms in PD, most rTMS
studies have focused on one or the other symp-
tom, usually targeting one stimulation site
(e.g., DLPFC or motor cortex). In addition,
studies have had limited sample size and used
sham controls that may not offer true blind-
ing. The present study was designed to address
these issues.
METHODS This study was designed to answer the following
questions with Class I level of evidence in patients with PD with
comorbid depression: Is M1 HF rTMS superior to realistic
sham for motor symptoms as assessed by Unified Parkinson’s
Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) part III? Is DLPFC HF rTMS
superior to realistic sham for mood symptoms as assessed by
Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D)? Is combined M1
and DLPFC HF rTMS superior to realistic sham for both motor
and mood symptoms, and is there any evidence of synergistic
effects? The primary endpoint for all measures was 1 month
after the end of rTMS sessions.
Participants. Patients with idiopathic PD (according to UK
Parkinson’s Disease Brain Bank criteria), bilateral motor symptoms
(Hoehn and Yahr stage II–IV), and comorbid major depression (ac-
cording to DSM-IV) were eligible. Depression inclusion criteria
included HAM-D score .7 despite current use of antidepressant(s)
for a minimum of 90 days, adequate past trial of antidepressants
(6 weeks on an optimized dose), or documented intolerability to
antidepressants. Patients with ferromagnetic implants, a history of
seizures,
major
head
trauma,
dementia
(Montreal
Cognitive
Assessment [MoCA] scale score ,26), or depression with psychotic
symptoms were excluded. Participants were prospectively recruited
from 7 clinical centers from May 1, 2011, to June 30, 2014: Beth
Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School (Boston,
MA), New York University School of Medicine (New York, NY),
Toronto Western Research Institute (Toronto, ON, Canada),
University of California School of Medicine (Los Angeles, CA),
Cleveland
Clinic
(Cleveland,
OH),
University
of
Florida
(Gainesville, FL), and University of North Dakota School of
Medicine (Grand Forks, ND; figure 1).
Study design. This was a double-blind, sham-controlled,
randomized, parallel-group study of fixed-dose, HF rTMS in
patients with PD with depressive symptoms. Participants were
randomized in a 1:1:1:1 fashion to receive rTMS over the
bilateral M1, left DLPFC, both, or neither (sham rTMS).
Primary outcome measures were a change in UPDRS-III and
HAM-D at 1 month after the completion of rTMS treatment
compared with baseline (pretreatment) scores. Secondary outcome
measures included the Beck Depression Inventory-II, Clinical
Anxiety Scale, MoCA, and Clinical Global Impression scale,
UPDRS total score and subscales (parts I, II, and IV), and
Parkinson’s Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39). Scores were assessed
at baseline, at 1 week after treatment (63 days), and after 1 month
(67 days), 3 months (67 days), and 6 months (67 days). All motor
and mood scores were assessed in the medication “off” state ($12
hours after the last dose). An investigator blinded to rTMS
conditions performed all neurologic and psychiatric evaluations.
Throughout the study, participants continued their antidepressant
and antiparkinsonian medications without dose adjustments. To
assess the efficacy of the realistic sham, at the end of the treatment
period, participants were asked to guess the stimulation received (forced
choice of any real vs sham).
Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient
consents. This study was approved by the Institutional Review
Board of each participating site. Written informed consent was
obtained from each participant. The study was registered with
ClinicalTrials.gov with the identifier NCT01080794.
Treatment regimen. Participants received rTMS always in the
“on” state (z1 hour after anti-PD medications) while seated in
a chair with EMG electrodes over the abductor pollicis brevis (APB)
muscle to record motor evoked potentials. A Magstim Super-Rapid
stimulator (Magstim Co, Ltd, Carmarthenshire, Wales, UK) was
connected to a 70-mm-diameter figure-of-eight coil (or equivalent
sham coil). The left and right M1 sites were determined as the scalp
location from which TMS evoked motor evoked potentials of
maximal amplitude in the contralateral APB. Resting motor
threshold was determined with the left M1. The left prefrontal
site was located 5 cm anterior to the optimal left M1 location for
the APB.4
The rTMS course consisted of daily sessions of 2,000 stim-
uli for the left DLPFC and 1,000 stimuli for each M1 (50 trains
of 40 stimuli at 10 Hz for 10 days). All centers used the same
method for targeting the motor cortex and the left DLPFC.
In each session, real or sham rTMS was delivered over the left
DLPFC and left and right M1 sequentially. At one site (treating
9 patients, 3 of whom were in the M1 1 DLPFC group), the
stimulation order was reversed (left M1 stimulation was fol-
lowed by right M1 and then left DLPFC for all participants).
For sham rTMS, we replicated the look, sound, and feel of
active stimulation, in the absence of a significant magnetic field,
using a matched air-cooled sham coil. Scalp muscle stimulation
associated with rTMS was replicated with rubber electrodes
placed over the center of the coil connected to a constant cur-
rent stimulator (Digitimer DS7AH) with a pulse duration of
200 microseconds at 120 V and current intensity set to 10 mA.
If stimulation at 10 mA was not perceived, it was adjusted
upward; if it was uncomfortable, it was lowered.
Duration of treatment. Participants received real or sham rTMS
for 25 minutes for the left DLPFC and 12.5 minutes for each M1,
with no pauses between. Each participant received 10 rTMS sessions
over 2 weeks. The treatment duration was same for both rTMS tar-
gets and was chosen on the basis of prior rTMS studies in PD.14,15
Statistical analysis. Demographic and clinical variables were
compared by use of analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey
post hoc and x2 tests (for proportions). Significance of primary
endpoints (change in UPDRS-III and HAM-D from baseline to
month 1 after treatment) was assessed with independent-samples
t test for absolute change in a measured score. To ensure that

 results at the primary endpoint were not driven by individual
outliers, we tested any significant findings for individuals .2
SDs from the mean and, if present, repeated the analysis with
those participants excluded. In additional analyses incorporating
all study time points, we conducted repeated-measures ANOVA
(rANOVA) for all study groups with Dunnett post hoc tests (with
the double-sham rTMS group as a reference). Study data were
captured with the REDCap database.17
Sample size estimation and interim analyses. Initial study
design called for enrollment of 160 participants on the basis of
predicted motor effects of 0.9 in the M1 1 DLPFC group and
0.6 in the other 2 rTMS groups compared to double sham (mean
change of 9 vs 6 vs 1 point in UPDRS-III with an SD of 10).9
Effect sizes for mood were predicted to be larger.9,14 Controlling
for 2 primary outcome measures across 3 rTMS groups (Dunnett
2-sided multiple-comparison test with control procedure), this
sample size provided 81.7% power to claim that at least one of
the active groups was significantly different from the double sham
in the mean change of UPDRS-III.
An interim analysis was planned a priori at the study mid-
point (80 participants enrolled) to potentially eliminate $1 of
the 4 subgroups, thus increasing power in the remaining groups.
This interim analysis was conducted early (61 participants
enrolled) because of slower-than-expected recruitment.

 RESULTS Of the 85 participants who completed
screening (figure 1 and figure e-1 at Neurology.org),
61 were randomized to receive rTMS: M1 1 DLPFC
rTMS (n 5 20); M1 rTMS ( 1 sham DLPFC; n 5 14);
DLPFC rTMS ( 1 sham M1; n 5 12); and double
sham (n 5 15). Of these, 60 (98%) were assessed at the
primary endpoint, and 50 (82%) completed all study
visits. Patients’ demographics are summarized in table 1.
No differences in demographic or clinical variables were
found between study completers (n 5 50) and
noncompleters (n 5 11). Similarly, no differences
were found in the distribution of participants with
different stages (severity) of the disease across study
groups (p . 0.05, x2, table 1).
Only 49% of participants correctly guessed the
stimulation status (real vs sham), confirming the
efficacy of the blinding method used. rTMS was
well tolerated by all participants, although 34
(68% of completers) reported adverse events, most
commonly headache and neck pain, which were
mild and transient. One serious adverse event
(ischemic stroke) occurred in a patient receiving
active rTMS (deemed unrelated to the study). The
distribution of adverse events was similar in the
active TMS groups (25 of 46) and the double-
sham group (9 of 15).
At the primary study time point, UPDRS-III abso-
lute change was greater in the M1 group (24.9 points)
than in the double-sham group (20.3 points; mean
difference 5 24.6, 95% confidence interval [CI]
20.1 to 29.1, t 5 22.1, p , 0.05), indicating
improvement in motor symptoms with real stimula-
tion (table 2 and figure 2A). There were no significant
outliers. rANOVA comparing UPDRS-III at all study
time points between those 2 groups was not significant
(figure 2B). Exploratory post hoc analysis comparing
the M1 and double-sham groups at the primary study
endpoint showed improvement in the M1 group in
UPDRS-III subscores of rigidity (mean difference 5
20.5, 95% CI 21.4 to 20.8, t 5 3.0, p , 0.01) and
bradykinesia (mean difference 5 0.3, 95% CI 20.6 to
20.01, t 5 2.1, p , 0.05) but not tremor, gait, or
axial symptoms.
Absolute change in HAM-D was unexpectedly less
in the DLPFC group (21.4) than in the double-sham
group (26.1) at the primary endpoint (mean differ-
ence 5 24.7, 95% CI 0.7–8.7, t 5 2.4, p , 0.05,
table 2 and figure 2C). When a single outlier was
removed, the difference was no longer significant.
rANOVA comparing HAM-D score at all study time
points between those 2 groups was not significant
(figure 2D).
In the M1 1 DLPFC group, there was no signif-
icant improvement in either motor or mood symp-
toms at the primary endpoint compared to the
double-sham group (table 2 and figure 3, A and C).
Similarly, rANOVA comparing UPDRS-III and
HAM-D scores at all study time points between those
2 groups was not significant (table e-1 and figure 3, B
and D). There was no added benefit of M1 1
DLPFC stimulation on motor symptoms compared
to M1 stimulation alone (figure 3, A and B), as well as
no benefit of M1 1 DLPFC stimulation on mood
symptoms compared to DLPFC alone (figure 3, C
and D).
Subgroup analysis of mild PD (baseline UPDRS-
III , 32, median score for the study population)
or more advanced PD (UPDRS-III $ 32) showed

 no difference in change in UPDRS-III or HAM-D
(from baseline to the primary study time point)
between each subgroup and the double-sham group.
Similarly, no mood effects of rTMS were observed
when the study population was divided into 2 sub-
groups by median HAM-D score.
No study group differences were found in the
secondary outcome scores, including Beck Depres-
sion Inventory-II, Apathy Evaluation Scale, Clini-
cal

MoCA,
and
PDQ-39;
in
subscales of the UPDRS (parts I, II IV) and
UPDRS total score; and in the Clinical Global
Impression scale completed by a blinded physician
and study participants.
Given our above finding of improved motor func-
tion in the M1 rTMS group, we performed additional
analyses to better understand this result. First, we
looked to see whether improvement in UPDRS-III
translated into improvement in quality of life (mea-
sured by PDQ-39) in the M1 rTMS group, but no
such correlation was found. Similarly, there was no
difference in change of the PDQ-39 between the
M1 and double-sham groups. Next, although disease
duration was not significantly different across all
study groups, there was a difference between the
M1 and double-sham subgroups (table 1), so we
tested how this factor influenced results. Across all
participants, there was no significant relationship
between disease duration and UPDRS improvement
at 1 month (r 5 20.05, p 5 0.71). When disease
duration was entered as a covariate, the difference in
UPDRS improvement between the M1 and double-
sham group persisted (25.0 in the M1 group vs 20.3
in the double-sham group), but statistical significance
was reduced (p 5 0.07).
DISCUSSION In this clinical trial, we found benefit
of M1 rTMS for motor symptoms of PD but no ben-
efit of left DLPFC rTMS for mood symptoms and no
benefit of combined M1 1 DLPFC rTMS for motor
or mood symptoms.
HF rTMS to bilateral M1 was beneficial for motor
symptoms, and the effect persisted for at least 1 month.
This result is consistent with prior studies5,10,18,19 and
confirms the conclusions of 2 meta-analyses.7,9 Our
study shows motor benefit compared to realistic sham,
with documentation that participants were unable to
reliably distinguish the 2 interventions. The magnitude
of the improvement (24.9 points in the UPDRS-III)
was equal to a minimal clinically important change on
the UPDRS-III20 but slightly below that found in
recent meta-analyses (26.4 and 26.3 points7,21). We
believe that the lower magnitude of improvement seen
here is most likely secondary to the use of realistic sham
(which
might
have
mitigated
expectations
and
improved blinding) and to smaller sample sizes in other
studies. Another possible reason is the enrollment of
patients with PD with depression.
Consistent with prior reports,22,23 post hoc analy-
sis of the M1 group revealed benefits of rTMS for
measures of bradykinesia and rigidity but not tremor
or axial symptoms, for which alternative rTMS targets
may be better.24 Nevertheless, the benefit of M1
rTMS on these symptoms did not translate to an
improvement in quality of life, as measured by the
PDQ-39 scale.

 Contrary to prior reports,14,25 we failed to find
an improvement in PD-associated depression after
2 weeks of left DLPFC rTMS. The magnitude of
our antidepressant effect, while similar to that seen
in prior studies in PD (z30% improvement in
HAM-D),14,25,26 was greater in the double-sham
group than in the real DLPFC rTMS group, likely
the result of a pronounced placebo response. We
doubt this difference is meaningful because, unlike
the motor effect, it was restricted to a single time
point and driven by an outlier. Nevertheless, real
DLPFC rTMS did not afford any advantage over
realistic sham. As opposed to other rTMS studies in
patients with PD with depression, our participants
continued rather than withheld antidepressants,
which eliminated possible confounding effects of
antidepressant withdrawal but could have amplified
placebo response. Additionally, we included patients
with PD with HAM-D score of $8, which is low
compared to prior studies. However, our subgroup
analysis of mild and severe depression showed no
difference of rTMS effects.
The duration of the rTMS course in our study (and
in prior studies of PD-associated depression) was only
10 days, while in the major multisite, double-blind
clinical trials for primary (non-PD) depression, it was
20 to 30 days,27 and it often took 15 days for patients
to experience a significant antidepressant response
beyond sham.28 Therefore, a longer course of rTMS
could still be beneficial for PD-associated depression.
Regarding the main objective of this study, multi-
focal stimulation, concurrent rTMS of the left
DLPFC and bilateral M1 was not better than sham
for either motor or mood symptoms. Furthermore,
there was no evidence of synergistic effects compared
with left DLPFC or M1 alone. The neurophysiology

 of concomitant TMS stimulation over different sites
is unknown, and it is possible that instead of a sum-
mation, a cancellation occurred. Three prior studies
have combined M1 and DLPFC rTMS in PD, and
all reported motor benefit, but they differed from
the current study in important ways.29–31 Two of
these studies lacked a sham control, used low-
frequency rather than HF rTMS to M1, and used
a different type of TMS coil. The third study30 was
the most similar to the present study but included
rTMS to the right DLPFC, a different type of sham,
no M1 stimulation condition, and different TMS
frequency and duration.30
The divergent placebo response with regard to
mood and motor outcomes deserves mention. While
the double-sham group had a robust antidepressant
response that persisted for the study duration, there
was no improvement in motor scores in this group,
despite participants being told that the study was
designed to improve both. The fact that one can
observe a pronounced placebo-induced improvement
in one domain and no improvement in another
provides insights into the selectivity of placebo effects
and is of great relevance for appropriate design of PD
therapeutic trials.32
The study has several important limitations. First,
it was terminated prematurely due to difficulty with
recruitment and an interim analysis showing lack of
efficacy in the M1 1 DLPFC group. Thus, statistical
power (compared to the initial study design) was
reduced, and results were not corrected for multiple
comparisons. Although one can argue that such cor-
rection is not necessary given clear a priori hypotheses
supported by the literature, this increases the chance
of type II error. Second, we enrolled a heterogeneous
patient population with mild and advanced disease
and with variable years of drug exposure, which
may have obscured effects in specific subgroups.
Third, although there were no significant differences
in disease duration across groups, we cannot exclude
the possibility that this may have influenced motor
improvement in our M1 subgroup. Finally, the de-
tails of the PD medication regimen and presence of
motor fluctuations were not collected in a systematic

mood (C and D) symptoms after combined M1 1 dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) vs sham. There
was also no added benefit of M1 1 DLPFC stimulation on motor symptoms compared to M1 stimulation alone (A and B) or mood benefit compared to DLPFC
alone (C and D).

 manner. This could affect both mood and motor out-
come measures assessed exclusively during the “off”
state.
The study failed to demonstrate a beneficial effect of
multifocal rTMS for the treatment of motor and mood
symptoms in PD, although it provided several valuable
outcomes that can guide future work. First, M1 rTMS
appears promising for improving motor symptoms in
PD. Second, there appears to be a pronounced placebo
response to rTMS for mood symptoms in PD, and
future work should consider longer-duration trials con-
sistent with studies in primary depression. Finally, the
combined M1 1 DLPFC rTMS protocol used here
does not appear to be a promising therapeutic avenue,
and future work should consider alternative protocols.
