ABSTRACT
Background: Conflicting evidence exists on the role of long-term
fructose consumption on health. No systematic review has ad-
dressed the effect of isoenergetic fructose replacement of other
sugars and its effect on glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting blood
glucose, insulin, and triglycerides.
Objective: The objective of this study was to review the evidence for a
reduction in fasting glycemic and insulinemic markers after chronic,
isoenergetic replacement of glucose or sucrose in foods or beverages
by fructose. The target populations were persons without diabetes, those
with impaired glucose tolerance, and those with type 2 diabetes.
Design: We searched the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, the
WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform Search Portal, and
clinicaltrials.gov. The date of the last search was 26 April 2016. We
included randomized controlled trials of isoenergetic replacement of
glucose, sucrose, or both by fructose in adults or children with or without
diabetes of $2 wk duration that measured fasting blood glucose. The
main outcomes analyzed were fasting blood glucose and insulin as well
as fasting triglycerides, blood lipoproteins, HbA1c, and body weight.
Results: We included 14 comparison arms from 11 trials, includ-
ing 277 patients. The studies varied in length from 2 to 10 wk
(mean: 28 d) and included doses of fructose between 40 and 150 g/d
(mean: 68 g/d). Fructose substitution in some subgroups resulted in
significantly but only slightly lowered fasting blood glucose
(20.14 mmol/L; 95% CI: 20.24, 20.036 mmol/L), HbA1c
[210 g/L (95% CI: 212.90, 27.10 g/L; impaired glucose toler-
ance) and 26 g/L (95% CI: 28.47, 23.53 g/L; normoglycemia)],
triglycerides (20.08 mmol/L; 95% CI: 20.14, 20.02 mmol/L), and
body weight (21.40 kg; 95% CI: 22.07, 20.74 kg). There was no
effect on fasting blood insulin or blood lipids.
Conclusions: The evidence suggests that the substitution of fructose
for glucose or sucrose in food or beverages may be of benefit to
individuals, particularly those with impaired glucose tolerance or
type 2 diabetes. However, additional high-quality studies in these
populations are required.

INTRODUCTION
Concern about the effect of long-term consumption of sugars,
in particular fructose, has been growing over several decades.
Much discussion has suggested that increased fructose con-
sumption, particularly through the consumption of high-fructose
corn syrup, is contributing substantially to an increase in type 2
diabetes (1–3). Furthermore, fructose consumption has been
linked to de novo lipogenesis (and particularly to triglyceride
production; e.g., references 4–6) and body weight (7).
In our related systematic review and meta-analysis on fructose
replacement of glucose or sucrose in acute studies, we showed
that fructose consumption substantially lowers postprandial
markers of glycemia without increasing triglyceride concentra-
tions (8). However, the question remained as to whether the
effects of acute fructose substitutions would also be seen in
chronic substitutions.
Previous work in this area focused on fructose replacement
of any other carbohydrates (e.g., references 9–11). Further-
more, many clinical trials in this area suffered from failing
to control for total carbohydrate intake, thus precluding any
attribution of benefits and harms to fructose (e.g., references
12 and 13). We believe that, in practice, people at risk of or
suffering from diabetes will substitute one sugar for another in
an isoenergetic or near-isoenergetic manner. In this real-word
scenario, fructose-sweetened foods would be swapped for
sucrose- or glucose-sweetened foods, rather than for breads,
pasta, or other carbohydrate sources. Thus, we focused our re-
search only on feeding trials that tested the isoenergetic sub-
stitution of fructose for sucrose or glucose. Indeed, the WHO
recently called for more systematic reviews and meta-analyses in
RAE was supported by a University of Canberra undergraduate scholarship.

related outcomes (14).
METHODS
PRISMA guidelines
The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed, and a
PRISMA checklist was completed and provided (15).
Registration of protocol
The protocol for this meta-analysis was designed a priori and
the review was registered with the PROSPERO International
Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (16).
Data sources and searches
We searched the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, the
WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform Search
Portal, and clinicaltrials.gov databases with no time or language
restrictions. The date of the last search was 26 April 2016. The
search strategy was designed for Entrez-PubMed by RAE, JHC,
KEM, and Fiona Lithander (University of Canberra) and was
converted by scientific librarians for other database searches. The
Entrez-PubMed search strategy is presented in Supplemental
Table 1. The search strategy was designed to identify relevant
controlled trials. To do this, we searched for studies involving
fructose as well as glucose or sucrose along with a measurement
of blood glycemia or insulinemia. All citations were uploaded
into EPPI-Reviewer 4 (17). After removal of duplicates, the
2075 abstracts were assigned in EPPI-Reviewer 4 to 2 authors
(RAE and KEM) for blind inclusion on the basis of the fol-
lowing 4 criteria: 1) study in humans, 2) clinical trial, 3) fructose
as an intervention, and 4) glucose or sucrose as a control. Dif-
ferences in allocation were resolved by consensus.
Study selection
All of the included abstracts were examined as full-text ar-
ticles. Blind inclusion of full-text articles was carried out in
EPPI-Reviewer 4 by 2 authors (RAE and KEM) on the basis of
the following 9 criteria: 1) adult or child population who were
not acutely ill, 2) individuals with or without diabetes, 3)
fructose intervention, 4) either glucose or sucrose control, 5)
substitution was isoenergetic, 6) the study was a randomized
controlled trial, 7) the study period was $2 wk in duration, 8)
the study was blinded at least to participants or the diet was
controlled or provided, or both, and 9) the study presented data
on blood glucose. Discrepancies between authors were resolved
by consensus. Hand-searching of citations was done by 1 author
(RAE), and 2 authors examined new abstracts, as above. The
final number of included study arms was 14 from 11 articles
(Table 1, Figure 1).
Data from the included trials were extracted by one author
(RAE) and double-checked by a second author (KEM). Out-
come measures were extracted [glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c);
fasting blood glucose; fasting blood insulin; fasting blood
triglycerides; HDL, LDL, VLDL, and total cholesterol; apo-
lipoprotein B100; and body weight] as well as participant

 characteristics, sample size, inclusion and exclusion criteria,
and duration of intervention.
The definitions of normoglycemic, impaired glucose tolerance,
and type 2 diabetes were taken from Diabetes Management in
General Practice (29). If stated, we used the study authors’
classification of their study population. If this was not stated,
fasting blood glucose values were calculated by using the mean
blood glucose value at time 0 of the intervention.
The study quality was assessed by following the Cochrane
Handbook for Systematic Reviews (30). Two investigators (RAE
and Fiona Lithander) independently assessed the risk of bias
based on 1 random sequence generation, 2 allocation conceal-
ment, 3 blinding of participants and personnel, 4 blinding of
outcome assessment, 5 incomplete outcome data (attrition bias),
6 selective reporting (reporting bias) and other bias. Studies
were excluded for lack of blinding of participants unless the
background diet of the participants was strictly monitored or
provided by the research team.
Data synthesis and analysis
For all outcomes, the means and their SEs or SDs were
extracted from the studies. In cases in which a study had a number
of arms that used the same population, we extracted data from a
single arm. To avoid double counting of studies that used both
sucrose and glucose as controls, the data were separated in the
analyses by type of sugar. SDs were converted to SEs by using the
calculation SD = SE 3 square root of the number of subjects. In
the rare cases that SDs or SEs were not given, and they could not
be calculated from other information, they were imputed by
taking the mean of the SDs from all other studies reporting that
outcome (31). Outcome data were extracted into a Microsoft
Excel worksheet by one author (RAE) and were double-checked

from 146 remaining articles were examined by 2 of the study authors (RAE and KEM). From these 146 articles, 136 were excluded. An additional 2 studies
were identified by hand-searching of references from the included trials. A total of 12 trials (11 completed, 1 ongoing) were included in the final analysis. Of
these, 14 individual study arms were included in the meta-analyses. HTA, Health Technology Assessments; PRISMA, Preferred Reporting Items for

 by another author (KEM). Mean differences and SEs were cal-
culated for each outcome. Outcome data were copied into Review
Manager version 5.3 and analyzed by using a generic inverse
variance, random-effects model with 95% CIs. This model allows
for the combining of crossover and parallel trials (32). For stan-
dardized mean difference analysis, the means, SDs, and number
of subjects were analyzed in Review Manager 5.3 by using the
random-effects method with 95% CIs. Because the studies used
different populations, different doses, and different food vehicles,
we used a random-effects model rather than a fixed-effects model.
Sensitivity analyses or meta-regressions were undertaken to
determine the effect of study design (crossover compared with
parallel design), blinding, dose of sugar used, funding source,
diabetes status, body weight, sex, age, and sugar presentation (meal
compared with beverage). Meta-regression was carried out in cases
in which $10 studies were available for analysis. Outcomes with
,10 studies were considered to be insufficient to enable a
meaningful interpretation of the outcomes (31). Meta-regression
was undertaken by using OpenMetaAnalyst with a random-effects
method (33). Heterogeneity of 0–40% as measured by I2 was
defined as unimportant, 30–60% was considered moderate het-
erogeneity, 50–90% was defined as substantial heterogeneity, and
85–100% was defined as considerable heterogeneity.
RESULTS
Study characteristics
A total of 11 studies were included in the final analysis (Table 1).
The majority of studies used a crossover model but varied widely
in the dose of fructose used, as well as in its presentation (food or
beverage). The testing period varied from 2 to 10 wk (mean: 28 d).
The majority of studies substituted fructose for glucose rather than
for sucrose. Five studies included exclusively overweight or obese
subjects (22–24, 27, 28), whereas all other studies were either in
subjects of healthy weight (18, 19), of mixed weight (20, 26), or
did not specify the baseline weight of the subjects (25). Doses of
sugar ranged between 24 and 150 g/d (mean: 68 g).
Quality assessment
The study quality as determined by the Cochrane 7-item risk-
of-bias analysis (30) is shown in Supplemental Figure 1.
Overall risk of bias for most items was low, but items such as
random-sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding
of outcome assessment, and attrition bias were reported ,50%
of the time. Five of the 11 studies did not register a protocol, and
thus reporting bias could not be reliably established.
Meta-analysis
The meta-analysis included 14 study arms from 11 studies (Table
1). Nine of the studies used glucose as a control and 4 studies used
sucrose. To determine whether long-term, high-quality isoenergetic
feeding studies would lower fasting blood glucose, we performed
a meta-analysis on all 14 study arms (Figure 2A). The choice of
fasting blood glucose as the main outcome was based on 2 factors.
First, patients monitoring their blood glucose will routinely use
in-home glucose-monitoring kits rather than HbA1c measurements.
Second, the use of HbA1c was reported in only 2 arms of a single
study, thus reducing its usefulness as a primary outcome.
In most glucose and sucrose substitution studies, fasting blood
glucose was lowered, on average, by 20.14 mmol/L (95% CI:
20.24, 20.036 mmol/L) for glucose studies and by 20.20 mmol/L
(95% CI: 20.48, 0.08 mmol/L) for sucrose studies. High het-
erogeneity was found among sucrose feeding studies, and there
was no significant association overall between fructose replace-
ment of sucrose and fasting blood glucose concentrations. Among
the 14 study arms, only 1 study was undertaken in patients with
impaired glucose tolerance and 1 study in persons with type 2
diabetes (Figure 2B). The fasting blood glucose concentrations in
the 12 study arms in persons with normal fasting blood glucose
were, in general, only minimally lower after fructose substitution.
In contrast, the 2 studies in persons with impaired glucose toler-
ance or type 2 diabetes showed substantially larger decreases in
fasting blood glucose [20.6 and 20.8 mmol/L in individuals with
impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes, respectively (25, 27)].
To determine whether the reduction in fasting blood glucose was
reflected in fasting blood insulin, we meta-analyzed all of the studies
with fasting insulin outcomes (Figure 3). We found that neither
glucose nor sucrose replacement by fructose resulted in a change in
fasting blood insulin concentrations (Figure 3A). A subgroup
analysis by diabetes status similarly failed to show any significant
differences in fasting blood insulin between those consuming
fructose and those consuming glucose or sucrose (Figure 3B).
Analysis of other markers of glucose control, such as HbA1c
and HOMA-IR, was limited by a lack of studies. Only one study
measured HbA1c, both in normoglycemic persons and in those
with impaired glucose tolerance (25). This study found re-
ductions of 10 g/L (95% CI: 212.90, 27.10 g/L) and 6 g/L
(95% CI: 28.47, 23.53 g/L) after fructose replacement of glu-
cose in the 2 populations, respectively (Figure 4A). The overall
effect was highly significant (P , 0.0001).
In contrast, a meta-analysis of 6 studies examining HOMA-IR
found no significant changes after fructose replacement of glu-
cose, and a small but significant increase in HOMA-IR in the
sucrose replacement study (Figure 4B). HOMA-IR is a measure
of insulin resistance (34), calculated from fasting blood glucose
and insulin concentrations. Fructose replacement of glucose
resulted in a mean difference of 20.01 (95% CI: 20.38, 0.35;
P = 0.94), whereas fructose replacement of sucrose resulted in a
mean difference of 0.12 (95% CI: 0.04, 0.20; P = 0.003).
To see if weight gain was associated with isoenergetic exchange
of glucose or sucrose for fructose, we meta-analyzed the subset of
studies that measured body weight (Figure 4C). The 7 studies
substituting fructose for glucose showed a small net weight loss
associated with fructose consumption (21.40 kg; 95% CI: 22.07,
20.74 kg; P , 0.0001). This result was reinforced by the in-
termediate effect seen with the sucrose substitution studies, in
which a smaller and nonsignificant body-weight reduction was
observed (20.66 kg; 95% CI: 21.74, 0.43 kg; P = 0.24).
To study the effects of an isoenergetic exchange of fructose for
glucose or sucrose, we meta-analyzed the studies that measured
fasting blood triglyceride concentrations. We found no effect
on blood triglycerides in the glucose replacement studies
(20.01 mmol/L; 95% CI: 20.13, 0.11 mmol/L; P = 0.90) and a
small but significant reduction in fasting blood triglycerides in
the sucrose replacement studies (20.08 mmol/L; 95% CI: 20.14,
20.02 mmol/L; P = 0.007) (Figure 5A). A meta-analysis by di-
abetes status found no effect in normoglycemic patients, whereas
the single studies in patients with impaired glucose tolerance or

 type 2 diabetes both showed significantly lower triglyceride con-
centrations (P = 0.02 and 0.01, respectively) (Figure 5B).
We also meta-analyzed differences in total cholesterol, LDL
cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, VLDL cholesterol, and apolipo-
protein B100 concentrations. There were no significant differ-
ences in any of these lipoproteins (Figure 6).
Meta-regression was carried out for outcomes in which $10
studies were available for analysis. Given the relatively small
number of studies, we undertook meta-regression only where
feasible (Supplemental Table 2). The meta-regression results
should be interpreted with caution due to potentially unbalanced
studies, and in particular the very small sample sizes. For all of
the outcomes, the use of diabetes status as a covariate was not
possible. The heterogeneity of the fasting blood glucose data
could not be explained by dose, body weight, or age. In contrast,
dose appeared to explain 100% and 54% of the heterogeneity for
body weight and fasting blood triglycerides, respectively. In
addition, it is probable that obesity is a covariate that explains
the effect size (omnibus P = 0.003).
Sensitivity analyses of fasting blood glucose data were
carried out for trial design, blinding, funding, and mode of
sugar presentation (e.g., sugar solution compared with food).
There were no significant differences between crossover and
parallel trials (P = 0.09), mode of sugar presentation (P = 0.24),
funding source (P = 0.32), sex (male compared with mixed;
P = 0.43), or blinding (P = 0.11).

 To test for publication bias, we compiled funnel plots (Sup-
plemental Figure 2) and subjected them to Egger’s test for
funnel plot asymmetry (35). Plots measuring blood glucose
(Supplemental Figure 2A), blood insulin (Supplemental Figure
2B), or blood triglycerides (Supplemental Figure 2C) are un-
likely to be asymmetrical according to this test (P = 0.838,
0.181, and 0.289, respectively).
DISCUSSION
As discussed in our related meta-analysis, an enormous
amount of attention has been paid to fructose and, in particular,
fructose-containing beverages. Scientific articles and editorials
bemoan the negative effects of fructose on circulating lipids,
including triglycerides and lipoproteins [reviewed in Havel (36),
editorialized in Bray (37)]. Several individual studies identified
fructose consumption as the cause of increased lipid concen-
trations (4, 5, 38, 39). However, it appears that this general
concern was triggered by animal studies, largely performed in
rats and mice. The metabolism in rodents, especially relating to
insulin resistance and de novo lipogenesis, is strikingly different
from that in humans (40). Thus, the observed effects of increased
carbohydrate consumption on triglycerides and other lipids in
rodents may not accurately model metabolism in humans.
The most reliable evidence for causality in humans can only
come from clinical trials. Unfortunately, however, these trials
frequently suffer from poor design, such as inadequate study
length (41–43), unrealistic sugar intakes (24, 28), very small

 sample sizes (19, 21, 23–25), and most importantly, nonisoenergetic
exchange of nutrients (12, 13). All carbohydrates can be con-
verted to fatty acids. Therefore, a nonisoenergetic exchange, re-
sulting in excess energy intake, cannot assign causality to the
carbohydrate itself. This confounding can only be overcome
with a well-designed meta-analysis of isoenergetic clinical trials.
Some high-quality meta-analyses have been carried out that
examined the long-term effect of fructose on metabolism. For
example, a 2012 meta-analysis examined the effect of fructose
replacement of other carbohydrates on glycemic control in persons
with diabetes (9), and a recent review analyzed the effect of fructose
feeding trials on blood lipids (44). Sievenpiper et al. (45) looked at
the effect of fructose on body weight. However, in each case, the
fructose substitution was for other carbohydrates in general, not
sugars in particular. We felt that, in practice, persons with or at risk
of diabetes would consider substituting sucrose or glucose in food
with fructose, rather than replacing carbohydrates per se.
Fasting blood glucose
With regard to markers of glucose control, we found a sig-
nificant but small reduction in fasting blood glucose after fructose
consumption (Figure 2). From our related meta-analysis on the
postprandial effects of fructose replacement of glucose or sucrose
(8), we hypothesized that we would see a significant reduction in
fasting blood glucose. Although a significant reduction is evident,
it is of questionable clinical relevance. Thus, the conclusion from
the meta-analysis of these studies is that, although fructose
substitution does not increase fasting glucose concentrations, it
does not substantially reduce them either.

glucose, fructose for sucrose), where appropriate. Numbers in parentheses next to the study name indicate the reference number. IV, inverse variance.

 It should be noted, however, that the majority of the studies
were carried out in individuals with normal blood glucose
concentrations. The 2 studies in persons with impaired glucose
tolerance (25) and type 2 diabetes (27) showed large and highly
significant reductions in fasting blood glucose (20.61 and
20.80 mmol/L, respectively). It is therefore tempting to spec-
ulate that in patients who already have impaired glucose toler-
ance, regular substitution in the diet of other sugars with fructose
may reduce their fasting blood glucose in a clinically meaningful
way. However, as plausible as this may be, the lack of double-
blind, controlled isoenergetic studies in these groups means that
no definite conclusion can be drawn.
Fasting blood insulin
Fasting blood insulin concentrations, in contrast to fasting blood
glucose concentrations, were not significantly reduced after
fructose feeding compared with glucose feeding (0.14 mU/mL;
95% CI: 21.16, 1.43 mU/mL) or sucrose feeding (21.16 mU/mL;
95% CI: 23.71, 1.40 mU/mL). Again, we had hypothesized that
the large reduction in postprandial insulin concentrations seen in
our related postprandial meta-analysis would translate into re-
duced fasting insulin concentrations. It is possible, however, that
the small reduction in glucose without a concomitant reduction in
insulin may result from a slight improvement in insulin sensi-
tivity. This was particularly notable in the studies in persons with
impaired glucose tolerance (25) and type 2 diabetes (27) (Figure 3).
However, as stated above, the lack of high-quality studies in
these groups leaves us to guess at the true effect.
Triglycerides
In 1978, a review concluded that, at moderate doses, fructose
has no harmful side effects, either on cholesterol or on tri-
glycerides (46). In 1979, a carefully controlled study in hyper-
triglyceridemic men found no effect of fructose consumption on

 glucose, insulin, glucagon, or triglyceride concentrations (47).
Similarly, an isoenergetic exchange of starch by sucrose or
fructose resulted in no changes in serum triglycerides (41). In
another isoenergetic exchange clinical trial, Grigoresco et al. (48)
found a slight increase in plasma triglycerides with fructose
replacement of starch but no effect on body weight, HbA1c,
fasting plasma glucose, fasting plasma insulin, uric acid, total
cholesterol, or HDL cholesterol. Nevertheless, it has in recent
times become a common belief that fructose consumption in-
evitably results in increased triglycerides. Leaving aside the
argument of whether moderately increased triglycerides per se
have any negative health effects (49), our analysis of triglycerides
failed to find any significant differences in triglyceride con-
centrations between participants who consumed fructose and
those who consumed glucose, and we found a small but sig-
nificant decrease in triglycerides for sucrose-consuming partic-
ipants (Figure 5). This accords with an earlier meta-analysis
in the area (44), which found that an isoenergetic exchange of
fructose for other carbohydrates does not result in increased
blood triglycerides, and also with our own postprandial meta-
analysis, which found no increase in postprandial triglycerides
in the hours after fructose consumption (8).

CHRONIC FRUCTOSE SUBSTITUTION

 Body weight
An internet search with the use of the terms “obesity” and
“fructose” will bring up any number of websites linking fruc-
tose consumption to weight gain (e.g. reference 50). Indeed,
opinion pieces and reviews in the medical literature have
followed a similar path (51, 52). However, our results suggest
that fructose replacement of glucose or sucrose results in a
small but significant decrease in body weight (Figure 4C). This
affirms a comprehensive meta-analysis by Sievenpiper et al.
(45), which included studies comparing fructose replacement
of carbohydrates. In their analysis, fructose was associated
with an increase in body weight only in hypercaloric feeding
trials. That is, where fructose was added to existing meals,
weight gain occurred, whereas in isoenergetic trials, no such
weight gain was observed.
Our meta-analysis, along with previous high-quality meta-
analyses, did not find any clinically important differences in
fasting blood glucose, fasting blood insulin, fasting blood tri-
glycerides, fasting blood lipids, or body weight after isoenergetic
fructose consumption. This is in stark contrast with individual
studies that reported evidence of harm (4, 5, 38, 39). The most
likely explanation for this discrepancy is a lack of isoenergetic
exchange or a lack of quality in the majority of feeding studies.
The frequently encountered lack of quality is reflected in our
PRISMA diagram. Despite a large number of full-text articles
(145) identified in our analysis, only 11 studies were included
due to a lack of appropriate controls, a nonisoenergetic carbo-
hydrate exchange, a lack of blinding, no information on the
background diet, or other issues. Even within the included
studies, the sample size was usually very small (7–40; mean: 16).
Most concerning, however, was the lack of studies in in-
dividuals who would most benefit from or be harmed by fruc-
tose consumption, such as those with impaired glucose control
or diabetes. A recent review pointed out the absence of evi-
dence for the role of fructose in these population subgroups
(53), and we can concur. Larger, high-quality studies in at-risk
populations are urgently required.
The results of our systematic review and meta-analysis on the
isoenergetic exchange of glucose or sucrose by fructose in long-
term feeding studies suggest that, as we found with postprandial
effects, there may be benefits to long-term fructose consumption.
We found slight reductions in fasting glucose, HbA1c, body
weight, and triglycerides, but no change in insulin or other blood
lipids. Thus, medical practitioners who think that lowering
postprandial glycemia would benefit their patients should feel
comfortable in recommending fructose replacement of other
sugars, without being concerned about long-term adverse effects.
