Context: Spexin is a novel peptide that is implicated in obesity and related energy homeostasis in
animals and adult humans. Little is known about its role in children.
Objective: The aim of the current study was to determine the potential role of Spexin in obese
children and explore its relationships with various cardiometabolic risk factors.
Design and Participants: This was a cross-sectional study composed of 69 children (51 obese and
18 normal weight; age 15.3 � 0.26 y).
Outcome Measures: Spexin was measured using a specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
Leptin, total and high-molecular-weight adiponectin, IL-6, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, glu-
cose, and insulin were also measured. Mann-Whitney U test, Pearson and Spearman rank correlations,
logistic regression, and cluster analysis were used for the analysis and interpretation of the data.
Results: Spexin levels were significantly lower in obese vs normal-weight children, median(IQR) (0.33
ng/mL [0.27–0.44] vs 0.42 ng/mL [0.33–0.55]; P � .024), but did not correlate with other adipokines
and/or insulin and glucose levels. Ordinal categorical variables of Spexin showed a strictly reverse
association of obesity with the level of Spexin. Cluster analysis of Spexin and body mass index z score
resulted in splitting the participants into normal-weight and obese-weight groups with high accuracy.
Conclusions: Lower circulating levels of Spexin in obese children compared with their normal-
weight counterparts and the ability to discriminate obese and normal-weight groups based on
Spexin concentration enabled us to suggest a potential role for this novel peptide in childhood
obesity. The clinical significance of these findings needs additional investigation. (J Clin Endocrinol
Metab 101: 2931–2936, 2016)
T
he prevalence of obesity has tripled in the last three
decades, and currently 17% of children in the United
States are obese and 35% are either overweight or obese
(1). Childhood obesity is associated with a number of ad-
verse health consequences including type 2 diabetes
(T2DM), dyslipidemia, and hypertension, all which lead
to premature cardiovascular disease (2, 3).
Adipose tissue in addition to serving as a site for energy
storage has been found to have an endocrine function with
secretion of a whole variety of adipokines (4–6). Some of
these adipokine influence weight by their effect on satiety,
hunger, and glucose and lipid metabolism (7–10). Spexin
is a peptide initially identified using Markov modeling
(11). Its biological activity was subsequently recognized

 by Walewski et al (12). They reported that Ch12:orf39,
the gene that encoded Spexin, was the most down-regu-
lated gene in obese omental and sc human fat (13). The
same group also showed significantly lower Spexin con-
centrations in obese compared with lean adults and pro-
posed a potential satiety-inducing role for it in humans
(12). Spexin also reduced adipocyte uptake of long-chain
fatty acids (12). In addition, Spexin administration in ro-
dents with diet-induced obesity provokes weight loss by
decreasing caloric intake and increasing locomotion (12).
Circulating Spexin levels are low in patients with T2DM
and inversely related to blood glucose and lipids, suggest-
ing that the peptide may play a role in glucose and lipid
metabolism in T2DM (14). Taken together, it seems that
Spexin plays an important role in obesity and related co-
morbidities. However, there are no reports on Spexin con-
centrations in children. The aim of the study was to de-
termine Spexin concentrations in obese vs normal-weight
children in relation to various cardiometabolic risk
factors.
Materials and Methods
A total of 69 children (51 obese and 18 normal weight; age 15.3
� 0.26 y) were studied. The study participants were euthyroid,
nondiabetic, obese or normal-weight adolescents between the
ages of 12 and 18 years who had participated in a clinical trial
assessing the effect of vitamin D3 supplementation on 25 hy-
droxy vitamin D levels or cardiometabolic risk markers (www.
clinicaltrials.gov, NCT00858247 and NCT01058720). Exclu-
sion criteria included current cancer; hepatic or renal disorders;
and use of metformin, oral hypoglycemic medications, or glu-
cocorticoids in the previous 6 months; and any medical or psy-
chiatric condition that would interfere with study participation.
Participants were considered obese if body mass index (BMI)
was at or greater than 95th percentile for age and sex and nono-
bese if BMI was between the fifth and 85th percentile for age and
sex (15). The protocol for the study was approved by Institu-
tional Review Board of Mayo Clinic. Informed consent and as-
sent were obtained from participants and parents. The subjects’
BMI z scores were determined using the age-specific and sex-
specific median BMI, generalized coefficient of variation (S), and
the power of the Box-Cox transformation (L) based on U.S.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention growth curves (15).
Biochemical measurements
Spexin was measured using a specific ELISA from Phoenix
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Total and high-molecular-weight (HMW)
adiponectin, leptin, and IL-6 were also measured by ELISA
(R&D Systems Inc.).Serum insulin was measured using com-
mercial electrochemiluminescence immunoassay kits (Roche E
Modular, Roche Diagnostics). Glucose was measured using
Analox GM7 Glucose analyzer.
Statistical analysis
Demographics, clinical characteristics, and Spexin values
were summarized by normal-weight and obese subjects. Quan-
titative variables were summarized by mean (SD) or median (in-
terquartile range [IQR]), whichever was appropriate. A two-
sample t test or a Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare the
mean or median of the quantitative variables. Categorical vari-
ables were summarized by number and percentage of the pa-
tients. A �2 test was used to compare the distribution of sex
between normal-weight and obese-weight groups. A Pearson
correlation or Spearman rank correlation was performed to ex-
aminetheassociationofSpexinwithageandquantitativeclinical
characteristics. A Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare the
median Spexin between two groups because there were some
outliers in both groups. To further examine the association of
Spexin with obesity, we categorized children in ordinal groups
based on the levels of Spexin. We formed three group variables
using median split, tertiles and quartiles of Spexin. Then, we
examined the distributions of obese and normal-weight patients
over the groups of these three categorical variables. In addition,
we performed logistic regression to examine the association of
obesity with the ordinal categories of Spexin. We also performed
a cluster analysis of Spexin and BMI z score to group children.
Three distinct groups of children were identified based on the
correlation of Spexin and BMI z score. Distribution of obese and
normal-weight children was also examined over three groups.
BMI z score as well as other clinical and demographic variables
were examined by three cluster groups.
Model or test assumptions were checked and an appropriate
transformation or an equivalent nonparametric test was used.
All tests were two tailed at the level of significance of P � 0.05.
The statistical software R version 3.2 and SPSS version 22 were
used for the analysis.
Results
Clinical characteristics
Fifty-one obese adolescents (29 females, 22 males) re-
cruited to participate in a study to examine the effect of
vitamin D3 on 25(OH)D levels and cardiovascular risk
markers had their laboratory studies drawn between Sep-
tember 18, 2008 and July 9, 2010 (16). Eighteen normal-
weight adolescents (8 females, 10 males) were recruited as
part of a study to examine the effect of obesity on incre-
ment in 25(OH)D levels following vitamin D3 adminis-
trationhadlaboratorytestsdrawnbetweenNovember13,
2009 and October 6, 2010 (17).
Demographics, clinical characteristics, and Spexin con-
centration of the participants are outlined in Table 1. The
mean (�SD) age was 15.34 (2.21) years and 14.62 (2.29)
years in the normal-weight and obese-weight group, re-
spectively. As expected, the mean (SD) BMI was 20.25
(1.89) and 31.95 (4.49) and median (IQR) BMI percentile
was 46.92 (40.98–55.16) and 98.47 (98.00–98.87). They
were significantly different between the normal-weight
and obese-weight groups. All patients in the normal-

 weight category and all but two in the obese category were
Caucasian.
Spexin levels and weight status
Median (IQR) Spexin levels were significantly lower in
obese vs normal-weight children, 0.33 ng/mL (0.27–0.44)
vs 0.44 ng/mL (0.33–0.62); P � .025 (Table 1 and Figure
1). Further, age and sex did not show correlations with
Spexin levels (data not shown).
Table2presentsthedistributionsofnormal-weightand
obese patients by Spexin level based ordinal categorical
groups. In each of the three ordinal variables (quartiles,
tertiles, and median splits), as the Spexin level increased,
proportionofobesechildrenstrictlydecreased.Compared
with the group of children with the maximum level of
Spexin in each of three variables, there were strictly in-
creasing trends of the odds ratios of obese children with
decreasing levels of Spexin. For example, odds of being
obese in this group of children with the minimum level of
Spexin (Q1) is 5.25 times as high as it is in the group of
children with the maximum level of Spexin (Q4).
Cluster analysis of Spexin and BMI z score categorized
children in three distinct groups based on the correlation
between these two variables. The analysis was actually
able to classify 62 children of 69 in distinct groups of
normal weight and obese indicating a very strong reverse
association of Spexin levels and obesity. Group 2 contains
16 patients, all of whom were normal weight. Children in
this group, has a moderate level of Spexin. Group 3 con-
tains 46 patients, all of whom were obese. This group of
children contains the lowest level of Spexin. Group 1 con-
tains seven children, of whom five were obese. In this
group, level of Spexin is very high: median (IQR) was 0.91
(0.88–1.51).
In this dataset, we did not observe significant correla-
tion of Spexin levels with fasting insulin, glucose levels, or
with any of the adipokines and C-reactive protein.
Discussion
In the current study, we found significantly lower circu-
lating levels of Spexin in obese children compared with
normal-weight children. The lower concentration of
Spexin observed in children is similar to that reported in
severely obese adults (12). Intriguingly, Spexin did not
show significant relationship with cardiometabolic risk
factors in children, contrary to the data in adults. To our
knowledge, this is the first study on Spexin levels and its
potential relation with adipokines and other cardiometa-
bolic risk markers in children.
Spexin was initially identified using Markov modeling
as a novel peptide hormone whose biological significance

 was not clear (11). Tissue distribution studies in rat and
goldfish revealed that this peptide is widely expressed in a
variety tissues including skin and digestive, nervous, and
endocrinesystems(18,19).Microarraystudiesonsurgical
fat biopsies subsequently identified the Spexin gene as the
most down-regulated gene in obese human fat compared
with nonobese human fat (13). The significantly lower
Spexinconcentrationinobesechildreninthecurrentstudy
is consistent with that reported by Walewski (12) and col-
leagues in adults with severe obesity. Remarkably, cluster
analysis of the data allowed us to split the participants into
two major groups (normal weight and obese) and a small
(outlier) subgroup based on the concentration of Spexin in
relation to BMI z score (Table 3.). The high Spexin level of
the five children in the small outlier group was clearly a
contrast with the trend we observed in most obese chil-
dren. This analysis is robust and the data suggest an im-
portant role of Spexin in childhood obesity. However, its
proposed role in energy homeostasis and body weight reg-
ulation from adult studies could not be explored and con-
firmed in the current study. But Spexin administration
reduces caloric intake in rats and increase locomotion in
mice (12). In addition, Spexin seems to have a role in the
normal regulation of adipose tissue function including up-
take of long chain fatty acids, into adipocytes (12).
In the present study, Spexin levels did not show the
expected correlations with various cardiometabolic risk
factors, including leptin. This is in contrast with the study
in severely obese adults (12). We are not aware of any
previousstudythathasexaminedtherelationshipbetween
circulating Spexin levels and cardiometabolic markers in
children. Spexin levels have been noted to be inversely
correlated with fasting blood glucose in adults with type 2
diabetes (14), but such associations could not be found in

 the current study in children. Due to the criteria used for
exclusion of participants in the trials (16, 17) we did not
have patients with high blood glucose in the study, which
could have contributed to the lack of association between
Spexin and fasting plasma glucose levels. In children, al-
though the likelihood of obesity decreases as the level of
serum concentration of Spexin increases, the disparities in
the results between the previous studies in adults and our
study could be related to several other factors. Foremost,
children are not really little adults and studies have shown
fundamental differences in the mechanistic regulation of
various factors in children vs adults. Although the partic-
ipants in our study were adolescents with uncomplicated
obesity, the adult subjects in one study were severely obese
undergoing bariatric surgical procedures (12) and in the
other study had type 2 diabetes (14). The duration and
severity of obesity are important factors that contribute to
cardiometabolic risk later in adulthood (20). Therefore,
the obesity-related cardiometabolic abnormalities are
more likely to be present in the adults, especially with
severely obese adults. This could have contributed to the
observed relationship between levels of Spexin and vari-
ous risk factors for cardiometabolic disease. Because the
participants in the current study are school-age children,
their activity levels are likely to be quite different from the
severely obese adults or those with T2DM. So it is likely
that the differences in the data are related to the overall
better health of the obese children in our study compared
with the severely obese adults or diabetic patients in the
adult study.
The data must be interpreted based on the various
strengths and limitations of the study. Important strengths
of our study include the relatively large sample size, the
ethnic homogeneity of the participants, and the absence of
obesity-related comorbidities. Limitations include cross-
sectional nature of the study and lack of longitudinal data.
We were not able to determine whether Spexin levels were
influenced by regional fat distribution, pubertal status,
physicalactivitypatterns,and/orthedurationofobesityas
these data are not available in the current study. We ac-
knowledge the possibility that the lower Spexin levels in
obese children may simply reflect a mere association and
does not demonstrate its causative role in obesity or obe-
sity-related comorbidities such as diabetes and cardiovas-
cular disease.
In conclusion, circulating levels of Spexin are low in
obese children compared with their normal-weight coun-
terparts. The fact that Spexin concentration in partici-
pants in the current study enabled the discrimination of
children into obese and normal weight with high accuracy
is remarkable. This observation must be explored further
to validate a potential role for Spexin as biomarker in
discriminating children into obese and normal-weight
groups with accuracy. The exact function of this peptide
is currently under investigation and additional studies in
larger populations are required to validate the observa-
tionsinthecurrentstudyanddeterminetheimmediateand
long-term clinical significance of these findings.
