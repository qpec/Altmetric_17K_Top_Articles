abstract
CONTEXT: The effectiveness of tonsillectomy or adenotonsillectomy (“tonsillectomy”) for 
recurrent throat infection compared with watchful waiting is uncertain.
OBJECTIVE: To compare sleep, cognitive, behavioral, and health outcomes of tonsillectomy 
versus watchful waiting in children with recurrent throat infections.
DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library.
STUDY SELECTION: Two investigators independently screened studies against predetermined 
criteria.
DATA EXTRACTION: One investigator extracted data with review by a second. Investigators 
independently assessed risk of bias and strength of evidence (SOE) and confidence in the 
estimate of effects.
RESULTS: Seven studies including children with ≥3 infections in the previous 1 to 3 years 
addressed this question. In studies reporting baseline data, number of infections/sore 
throats decreased from baseline in both groups, with greater decreases in sore throat 
days, clinician contacts, diagnosed group A streptococcal infections, and school absences in 
tonsillectomized children in the short term (<12 months). Quality of life was not markedly 
different between groups at any time point.
LIMITATIONS: Few studies fully categorized infection/sore throat severity; attrition was high.
CONCLUSIONS: Throat infections, utilization, and school absences improved in the first 
postsurgical year in tonsillectomized children versus children not receiving surgery. 
Benefits did not persist over time; longer-term outcomes are limited. SOE is moderate for 
reduction in short-term throat infections and insufficient for longer-term reduction. SOE 
is low for no difference in longer-term streptococcal infection reduction. SOE is low for 
utilization and missed school reduction in the short term, low for no difference in longer-
term missed school, and low for no differences in quality of life.

Tonsillectomy in children has 2 
primary indications: recurrent 
tonsillitis and obstructive sleep 
apnea. Recurrent or severe tonsillitis 
has been defined as ≥7 episodes of 
sore throat in the preceding year, 
or ≥5 episodes in the each of the 
preceding 2 years, or ≥3 episodes in 
each of the preceding 3 years. 
1 No 
gold standard diagnostic test exists, 
however, to predictably attribute 
symptoms to tonsillitis. Often 
“tonsillitis” is used synonymously 
with sore throat or pharyngitis 
without diagnostic testing. However, 
the degree to which either of these 
terms reflects true tonsillitis is not 
known. Bacterial pharyngitis with 
group A streptococcus (GAS) can 
be diagnosed via rapid testing or 
culture. It is not possible, however, 
to determine whether the tonsil 
represents the infectious nidus or if 
the suspected pathogen represents 
normal bacterial flora for a particular 
child’s pharynx (colonization without 
negative health impact). Sore throat 
or pharyngitis may or may not have 
a tonsillar origin, and it is possible 
that many cases have alternative 
explanations. Nonetheless, most 
diagnoses of “tonsillitis” are made 
without supportive documentation 
or bacterial testing. 
2 In addition, 
frequency of infections as a metric 
of severity used to determine 
tonsillectomy eligibility 
1, 
 
3, 
4 is fraught 
with complexity related to diagnostic 
variability and inconsistent medical 
documentation. Thus, heterogeneity 
in diagnostic accuracy, establishment 
of severity, and frequency of 
infections complicates treatment 
decisions regarding tonsillectomy 
and the performance of comparative 
effectiveness of its treatments. 
1, 
 
3 
– 
5
Previous systematic reviews of 
tonsillectomy for recurrent throat 
infections have combined studies 
of children and adults and reported 
moderate reductions in sore throats 
in the first postoperative year with 
greater benefit associated with more 
severe baseline infections. 
6, 
 
7 
We conducted a new systematic 
review that included all currently 
available comparative studies 
to examine published evidence 
regarding the effectiveness of 
tonsillectomy compared with forms 
of watchful waiting (which could 
have included supportive treatment 
with medications such as antibiotics 
or nasal steroids) for children 
with recurrent throat infections. 
This review is a component of an 
Agency for Healthcare Research 
and Quality–commissioned 
comparative effectiveness review of 
tonsillectomy in children conducted 
by the Vanderbilt Evidence Based 
Practice Center. The full comparative 
effectiveness review and review 
protocol (PROSPERO registry 
number: CRD42015025600)

METHODS
Search Strategy and Study Selection
We searched the MEDLINE database 
via PubMed, Embase, and the 
Cochrane Library from January 1980 
to June 2016 using a combination 
of controlled vocabulary and key 
terms related to tonsillectomy 
and throat infections (eg, 
“tonsillectomy, 
” “adenotonsillectomy, 
” “streptococcal”). We also hand-
searched the reference lists of 
included articles and recent reviews 
addressing tonsillectomy in children 
to identify potentially relevant 
articles.
We developed inclusion criteria in 
consultation with an expert panel 
of clinicians and researchers ( 
Table 
1). We included comparative study 
designs (eg, randomized controlled 
trials [RCTs], prospective or 
retrospective cohort studies) and 
studies published in English. We did 
not include studies with high risk of 
bias as part of the evidence base.
Data Extraction and Analysis
One investigator extracted data 
regarding study design, descriptions 
of study populations and intervention 
and comparison groups, and 
baseline and outcome data using 
a standardized form. A second 
investigator independently verified 
the accuracy of the extraction 
and revised as needed. Principal 
outcomes of interest included the 
number and severity of recurrent 
throat infections, quality of life, and 
health care utilization (number of 
clinician visits or contacts, number 
of courses of antibiotics). Significant 
heterogeneity in outcomes reported 
precluded meta-analysis; thus, we 
synthesized studies qualitatively 
and report descriptive statistics in 
summary tables.
Assessment of Study Risk of Bias 
and Strength of Evidence
Two investigators independently 
evaluated the methodologic quality of 
studies using prespecified questions 
appropriate to each study design 
to assess risk of bias of RCTs and 
observational studies. 
16 Senior 
reviewers resolved discrepancies 
in risk of bias assessment, and 
we used an approach described 
in the full review 
17 to determine 
low, moderate, or high risk of bias 
ratings. Assessment of the strength 
of the evidence (SOE) reflects the 
confidence that we have in the 
stability of treatment effects in the 
face of future research. 
18 The degree 
of confidence that the observed 
effect of an intervention is unlikely 
to change in additional research, the 
SOE, is presented as insufficient, low, 
moderate, or high. Assessments are 
based on consideration of 5 domains: 
study limitations, consistency in 
direction of the effect, directness 
in measuring intended outcomes, 
precision of effect, and reporting 
bias. We determined the strength 
of evidence separately for major 
intervention-outcome pairs using a

Number and Severity of Throat 
Infections and Utilization
All of the included studies evaluated 
children with a history of mild to 
moderate throat infection (classified 
by number of infections reported, 
 
Table 1). Four RCTs

retrospective cohort study 
11 included 
children with at least 3 throat 
infections in the 1 to 3 years before 
surgery and reported on frequency 
of recurrent throat infections and 
clinician visits after surgery versus 
no surgery. In all studies reporting 
baseline data, number of infections 
decreased from baseline in both 
groups, with significantly greater 
decreases in sore throat days and 
diagnosed GAS infections in children 
who received tonsillectomy versus 
no surgery/watchful waiting with 
supportive care in the short term 
(<12 months).

who had medical management 
with tonsillectomized children 
experiencing 0.50 ± 0.43 sore throat 
episodes per year after surgery 
compared with nonsurgical group 
who had 0.64 ± 0.49 episodes 
over the same time frame (95% 
confidence interval [CI]: 0.16 to 
0.80). In the RCTs’ intention-to-treat 
analysis, number of sore throat 
episodes decreased by 3.5 (95% 
CI: 1.8 to 5.2) over the full 2-year 
study period for tonsillectomized 
children, but sore throats per month 
did not decrease significantly ( 
Table 
2). These studies are limited by 
a strong preference for surgery 
among parents of children with more 
severe symptoms, thus affecting the 
generalizability of the patients who 
were randomized. Children who were 
randomized were only moderately 
affected by their symptoms. The 
study also had significant attrition in 
return of the symptom diaries over 
time and difficulty obtaining provider 
records for review.
In 2 additional RCTs, children in the 
surgical groups had fewer visits for 
sore throat after tonsillectomy, but 
the number of visits for sore throat 
in the watchful waiting groups was 
also low. 
20 In the first postsurgical 
year, the tonsillectomy group had 
1.74 (95% CI: 1.54 to 2.00) episodes 
of sore throat or throat infection 
compared with 2.93 episodes (95% 
CI: 2.69 to 3.22) in the control group. 
Although statistically significant, it 
is unclear whether this difference is 
clinically meaningful.
In another RCT including both 
children with mild symptoms 
of throat infection or tonsillar 
hypertrophy (≥7 throat infections 
in the previous year or ≥5 in the 
previous 2 years or ≥3 in the 
previous 3 years and Brouillette 
obstructive sleep apnea score of 
<3.5—ie, in no apnea or possible 
apnea range), children who received 
tonsillectomy had fewer throat 
infections (defined as throat pain 
and fever) compared with those

14 Of note, many 
children originally allocated to no 
surgery/watchful waiting (n = 50 
of 149) crossed over to the surgery 
arm. One retrospective cohort study 
reported that children who did not 
undergo tonsillectomy were 3.1 
times (95% CI: 2.1 to 4.6, P < .001) 
more likely to test positive for GAS 
infection that those who underwent 
surgery. 
11 Children who did not have 
tonsillectomy also experienced GAS 
infections at a shorter time interval 
than the tonsillectomized children.
Another retrospective cohort study 
included children who had <3 throat 
infections in the previous year and 
used Read-coded data to identify 
provider visits. 
15 The study reported 
a net reduction in 3-year mean sore 
throat visits (which included visits 
for sore throat symptoms, tonsillitis, 
pharyngitis, and nonspecific upper 
respiratory infection) for children 
who underwent tonsillectomy 
compared with those who did not. 
This reduction decreased over time 
with 2.46 fewer visits (95% CI: 2.29 
to 2.63, P < .001) in years 1 to 3 and 
1.21 fewer visits (95% CI: 1.04 to 
1.38, P < .001) in years 4 to 6, or 0.61 
sore throat visits per child per year 
(over the 6-year study period). This 
study captured provider visits and 
is subject to inaccuracies in medical 
coding. Episodes of sore throat 
that did not lead to a provider visit 
or visits with multiple concerns, 
which may have included throat 
infection, and were coded under 
another primary complaint were 
not captured.

assessment of tonsillectomy versus 
no surgery to improve number of 
throat infections, associated health 
care utilization, days of work/school 
missed, and quality of life shows a 
benefit in the first postsurgical year, 
with diminishing benefit over time.
SOE
Compared with no surgery, 
tonsillectomy reduced utilization 
(clinician contacts) and missed 
school/work in the short term. 
We have low confidence in this 
conclusion (low SOE). We have 
greater confidence that compared 
with no surgery, tonsillectomy 
reduced sore throats/throat 
infections or streptococcal infections 
in the short term (<12 months; 
moderate SOE). In the longer term 
(>12 months), we found no difference 
between groups in reduction of 
streptococcal infections (low 
SOE). We also found no significant 
differences between groups in missed 
school/work or quality of life in the 
long term (>12 months) and have 
low confidence in these conclusions 
(low SOE).
We could not make a conclusion 
about longer-term effects on sore 
throats/throat infections (insufficient 
SOE) because few studies reported 
longer-term data, and those that did 
had high attrition rates. Only 1 study 
included children with <3 episodes 
of throat infection in the year before 
surgery 
15; we could not make 
conclusions about outcomes reported 
in this single study (insufficient SOE).

15 These benefits did not persist 
over time. Most studies in this review 
included children with a history of 
mild to moderate throat infection (at 
least 3 episodes of sore throat in the 
year before surgery), and benefits 
of tonsillectomy were moderate in 
this population. Studies including 
children with a well-documented 
greater number of infections, such as 
the seminal Paradise et al study, may 
provide evidence for more marked 
benefits but were excluded from this 
review due to high risk of bias (due 
to potential selection bias and high 
attrition). 
1
As noted, most evidence addresses 
short-term effects. Although studies 
consistently reported reductions 
in sore throats and health care 
utilization in the first postsurgical 
year, evidence about long-term 
benefits of tonsillectomy for throat 
infection is limited. Thus, individual 
decision-making needs to balance 
the benefits of reducing illness-
related outcomes (including missing 
school and work) with the risks 
associated with surgery. Caregivers 
and providers may wish to consider 
the potential benefits and drawbacks 
of attempting to manage children’s 
illnesses for a period of time to see 
if they outgrow the propensity for 
infection to avoid surgery.
Despite substantial research, the 
literature is largely silent on the 
natural history of throat infections 
that would provide a basis for 
the need for tonsillectomy in the 
long term. More data are needed 
to describe the potential to 
outgrow frequent infections and 
population factors that may predict 
resolution. 
21

23 Long-term data 
are needed to enable caregivers 
to weigh the benefits of surgery 
versus the reality of managing their 
child’s condition as they wait for 
it to resolve, although obtaining

longer-term data is difficult, as 
evidenced by the high rate of attrition 
in most studies with >6 months’ 
follow-up included in this review.
Future studies should also 
attempt to characterize patient 
populations completely, including 
severity of throat infections, such 
that applicability can be much 
more specifically described and 
potential candidates for surgery or 
watchful waiting identified. Indeed, 
the literature lacks a consistent, 
consensus definition of infection; 
defining infection consistently is 
critical for promoting synthesis of 
research in the area. Tonsillitis or 
“sore throat” may also include cases 
of entities such as periodic fever, 
aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, 
cervical adenitis syndrome (PFAPA); 
clear characterization of children 
in studies is key for understanding 
effects on subpopulations. Relatively 
few data exist regarding predictable 
factors contributing to recurrence 
of symptoms of throat infections 
after tonsillectomy for primary 
management. A better understanding 
of these factors would also allow for 
more specific patient selection.
This review may be limited by our 
inclusion of studies published in 
English only; however, we identified 
few non-English studies of apparent 
relevance in a preliminary scan. 
Patient populations were generally 
poorly characterized, and little 
information was available on first-
line treatment attempts before 
surgery. Particularly in studies 
intended to assess effects of 
tonsillectomy on throat infections, 
parents of more severely affected 
children were noted to refuse 
randomization and crossover to 
surgery at high rates. Among those

studies focused on throat infection 
that did characterize patients 
more fully, most had low numbers 
of reported infections, and few 
reported culture-confirmed bacterial 
infections. Studies also did not 
describe the medical interventions 
children who did not undergo 
tonsillectomy may have received. 
Given heterogeneity and limited 
reporting in the literature, we 
were unable to identify potential 
subgroups that may respond more 
favorably to tonsillectomy or to 
supportive care.
Long-term effects are limited in 
the literature base, particularly 
regarding outcomes that include 
growth and development and quality-
of-life outcomes. Exploration of 
demographics of patient populations 
more likely to be refractory to initial 
management strategies is also 
limited. It appears clear that throat 
infections decline in children over 
time regardless of treatment group, 
but with high loss to follow-up, 
the relative contribution of this 
decline on apparent effectiveness 
is unknown. Definitions of severity 
have been assigned somewhat 
arbitrarily, based on best evidence or 
consensus approach, and until there 
is a robust literature surrounding 
natural history of throat infections 
in childhood, it may be difficult 
to achieve consistency in this 
description.
CONCLUSIONS
Tonsillectomy can produce short-
term reduction in throat infections 
compared with no surgery in 
children with ≥3 throat infections in 
the previous 1 to 3 years. Children 
undergoing tonsillectomy to 
improve number of throat infections, 
associated health care utilization 
(clinician visits), and days of work/
school missed had improvements 
in these outcomes in the first 
postsurgical year compared with 
children not receiving surgery. These 
benefits did not persist over time, 
and data on longer-term results are 
lacking. Quality of life improved 
regardless of surgery. Additional 
research to assess longer-term 
benefits of tonsillectomy compared 
with no surgery, as well as subgroups 
of children who may experience 
greater benefit, is needed to inform 
decision-making for caregivers and 
clinicians.
