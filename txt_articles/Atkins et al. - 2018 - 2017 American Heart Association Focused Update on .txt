ABSTRACT: This focused update to the American Heart Association 
guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and emergency 
cardiovascular care follows the Pediatric Task Force of the International 
Liaison Committee on Resuscitation evidence review. It aligns with the 
International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation’s continuous evidence 
review process, and updates are published when the International Liaison 
Committee on Resuscitation completes a literature review based on 
new science. This update provides the evidence review and treatment 
recommendation for chest compression–only CPR versus CPR using chest 
compressions with rescue breaths for children <18 years of age. Four 
large database studies were available for review, including 2 published 
after the “2015 American Heart Association Guidelines Update for 
Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care.” 
Two demonstrated worse 30-day outcomes with chest compression–
only CPR for children 1 through 18 years of age, whereas 2 studies 
documented no difference between chest compression–only CPR and 
CPR using chest compressions with rescue breaths. When the results 
were analyzed for infants <1 year of age, CPR using chest compressions 
with rescue breaths was better than no CPR but was no different 
from chest compression–only CPR in 1 study, whereas another study 
observed no differences among chest compression–only CPR, CPR using 
chest compressions with rescue breaths, and no CPR. CPR using chest 
compressions with rescue breaths should be provided for infants and 
children in cardiac arrest. If bystanders are unwilling or unable to deliver 
rescue breaths, we recommend that rescuers provide chest compressions 
for infants and children.

his focused update to the American Heart Asso-
ciation guidelines for cardiopulmonary resusci-
tation (CPR) and emergency cardiovascular care 
follows the Pediatric Task Force of the International 
Liaison Committee on Resuscitation’s evidence review 
published simultaneously with this update.1 It aligns 
with the International Liaison Committee on Resus-
citation’s continuous evidence review process, and 
updates are published when the International Liai-
son Committee on Resuscitation completes a litera-
ture review based on new science. A description of 
the evidence review process is available in the “2017 
International Consensus on Cardiopulmonary Resus-
citation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care Science 
With Treatment Recommendations Summary,”1 and a 
glossary of terms is available in that document. The 
International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation’s 
Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Develop-
ment, and Evaluation assessments were converted to 
the American College of Cardiology/American Heart 
Association Classes of Recommendations and Levels 
of Evidence (Table).2
This update provides the summary of evidence and 
treatment recommendation for chest compression–only 
CPR versus CPR using chest compressions with rescue 
breaths for children <18 years of age. For the purposes 
of these guidelines, the following holds:
• Infant basic life support guidelines apply to infants 
younger than ≈1 year of age.
• Child basic life support guidelines apply to children 
≈1 year of age until puberty. For teaching pur-
poses, puberty is defined as breast development in 
girls and the presence of axillary hair in boys.
• Adult basic life support guidelines apply at and 
beyond puberty.3
All other recommendations and algorithms pub-
lished in the “2015 American Heart Association Guide-
lines Update for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and 
Emergency Cardiovascular Care” and the “2010 Amer-
ican Heart Association Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary 
Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care”4 
remain the official recommendations of the American 
Heart Association.
COMPONENTS OF HIGH-QUALITY CPR: 
CHEST COMPRESSION–ONLY CPR
The “2017 International Consensus on Cardiopulmonary 
Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care Sci-
ence With Treatment Recommendations Summary”1 ad-
dresses the comparison of chest compression–only CPR 
and CPR using chest compressions with rescue breaths 
for cardiac arrest in infants and children. It includes 2 ad-
ditional out-of-hospital cardiac arrest studies published 
after 2015 that further expand the evidence base used 
to develop the 2015 guidelines update. A brief summary 
of each study included in the review is provided below.
2017 Summary of Evidence
A large observational study from the All-Japan Utstein 
Registry5 compared bystander-administered chest com-
pression–only CPR and CPR using chest compressions 
with rescue breaths from 2005 through 2007, a period 
when guidelines transitioned from a compression-to-
ventilation ratio of 15:2 to 30:2 for postpubertal chil-
dren and adults. Favorable neurological outcome and 
survival at 1 month were observed less frequently with 
chest compression–only CPR. When the results were 
stratified by age, children 1 through 17 years of age 
had worse outcomes with chest compression–only CPR, 
whereas no statistical difference between chest com-
pression–only CPR and CPR using chest compressions 
with rescue breaths was observed in infants <1 year of 
age. When further stratified by arrest cause, there was 
no difference between chest compression–only CPR 
and CPR using chest compressions with rescue breaths 
in patients with a presumed cardiac cause.
A subsequent study examined dispatch-assisted CPR 
in children using the same national Japanese database 
but with a later time interval, 2008 through 2010.6 CPR 
using chest compressions with rescue breaths was gen-
erally offered by dispatchers, but chest compression–
only CPR could be offered depending on the skill and 
knowledge of the rescuer.
Chest compression–only CPR resulted in worse 
1-month survival and worse 1-month survival with 
favorable neurological outcome compared with CPR 
using chest compressions with rescue breaths. Chest 
compression–only CPR was no different from no CPR.
A large observational study from the US-based 
CARES registry (Cardiac Arrest Registry to Enhance Sur-
vival) evaluated the association of bystander CPR with 
overall and favorable neurological survival. The CARES 
registry is an emergency medical services–based, vol-
untary data set that includes a catchment area of 90 
million people from 37 states within the United States. 
The authors compared bystander-administered chest 
compression–only CPR and CPR using chest compres-
sions with rescue breaths.7 The cohort was analyzed on 
the basis of age: <1 or 1 to 18 years. For infants, CPR 
using chest compressions with rescue breaths was bet-
ter than no CPR but was no different from chest com-
pression–only CPR for favorable neurological outcome. 
CPR using chest compressions with rescue breaths had 
higher survival to discharge than either no CPR or chest 
compression–only CPR. For children 1 to 18 years of 
age, CPR using chest compressions with rescue breaths 
was better than no CPR but was no different from chest 
compression–only CPR for both survival to hospital dis-
charge and favorable neurological status. Of note, out-

comes were statistically better in both bystander CPR 
strategies compared with no bystander CPR, as op-
posed to the Kitamura et al5 and Goto et al6 reports.
The most recent study originated from Japan with 
the use of the All-Japan Utstein Registry. The authors 
directly compared bystander chest compression–only 
CPR and CPR using chest compressions with rescue 
breaths in children >1 year of age who had cardiac ar-
rest, including traumatic arrest, during 2011 and 2012.8 
A national dispatch-assisted instruction protocol was in 
use, and CPR guidelines recommended a compression-
to-ventilation ratio of 30:2. Chest compression–only 
CPR and CPR using chest compressions with rescue 
breaths were associated with improved survival at 1 
month and favorable neurological survival at 1 month 
compared with no bystander CPR. There was no dif-

ference between chest compression–only CPR and CPR 
using chest compressions with rescue breaths.
2017 Recommendations—Updated
1. CPR using chest compressions with rescue 
breaths should be provided for infants and 
children in cardiac arrest (Class I; Level of 
Evidence B-NR). Based on a growing evi-
dence base since the 2015 guidelines update 
publication, this recommendation reinforces 
the 2015 guideline.
2. If bystanders are unwilling or unable to deliver 
rescue breaths, we recommend that rescuers 
provide chest compressions for infants and 
children (Class I; Level of Evidence B-NR).
We weighed the survival benefits of CPR using chest 
compressions with rescue breaths against the conve-
nience of aligning with the adult recommendation for 
chest compression–only CPR and concluded that the in-
cremental benefit of rescue breaths justified a different 
recommendation.
