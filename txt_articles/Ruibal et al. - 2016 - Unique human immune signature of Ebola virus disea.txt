Despite the magnitude of the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak 
in West Africa, there is still a fundamental lack of knowledge 
about the pathophysiology of EVD1. In particular, very little is 
known about human immune responses to Ebola virus2,3. Here 
we evaluate the physiology of the human T cell immune response 
in EVD patients at the time of admission to the Ebola Treatment 
Center in Guinea, and longitudinally until discharge or death. 
Through the use of multiparametric flow cytometry established 
by the European Mobile Laboratory in the field, we identify an 
immune signature that is unique in EVD fatalities. Fatal EVD 
was characterized by a high percentage of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells 
expressing the inhibitory molecules CTLA-4 and PD-1, which 
correlated with elevated inflammatory markers and high virus 
load. Conversely, surviving individuals showed significantly lower 
expression of CTLA-4 and PD-1 as well as lower inflammation, 
despite comparable overall T cell activation. Concomitant with 
virus clearance, survivors mounted a robust Ebola-virus-specific 
T cell response. Our findings suggest that dysregulation of the T cell 
response is a key component of EVD pathophysiology.
During the initial months of the EVD outbreak in Guinea, we trans­
ferred leftover blood samples from EVD patients diagnosed by the 
EMLab in Guéckédou (n = 47) to Europe (Extended Data Fig. 1a and 1b). 
 
Immunophenotyping analysis of these samples, indicated a sig­
nificantly higher expression of CTLA­4 in CD8+ T cells from EVD 
patients compared to non­EVD patients (n = 61) (Extended Data 
Fig. 1c). The levels of CTLA­4 were significantly higher in CD8+  
T cells from fatal EVD cases compared to survivors (Extended Data 
Fig. 1d). CTLA­4 plays an important role in inhibiting T cell func­
tion, an immune homeostasis mechanism to control excessive or per­
sistent T cell activation4,5. Owing to its regulatory properties, there 
are licensed therapeutics to either antagonize or enforce CTLA­4 
function6,7. Thus, we hypothesized that our findings could reflect a 
pathophysiological mechanism of EVD that might be amenable to 
therapeutics. However, we had concerns regarding the quality of the 
material that arrived at our laboratory after days of transport and we 
therefore established flow cytometry directly in Guinea to further eval­
uate T cell immunity in EVD. Leftover diagnostic blood samples from 
157 EVD patients tested by the EMLab at the Coyah Ebola Treatment 
Center (ETC) were transferred to our laboratory in Conakry within 
24 h after collection (Extended Data Fig. 2a, b). The median day of 
admission at the ETC for both fatalities and survivors was day 4 post 
symptom onset and, thus, outcome was not associated with the time 
elapsed between onset of disease and admission (Fig. 1a).
First, we evaluated the immune status of EVD patients upon their 
arrival to the ETC. Owing to the limitation to six parameters in our 
field analyses (Extended Data Fig. 3), we focused on the evaluation 
of individual markers of T cell function. We determined the expres­
sion levels of HLA­DR and Ki­67 as markers of activated T cells8, as 
well as PD­1 and CTLA­4, which together are key regulators of T cell 
homeostasis5,9. The percentage of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells expressing

CTLA­4 and PD­1 was significantly higher in fatal cases compared 
with survivors (Fig. 1b). Sometimes more than 50% of total CD8+ 
T cells expressed CTLA­4 (Fig. 1c). Fatal cases also showed higher 
frequency of Ki­67+ CD8+ T cells and HLA­DR+ CD4+ T cells than 
survivors (Fig. 1b).
High expression of both PD­1 and CTLA­4 has been correlated with 
functional exhaustion (loss of function) of T cells in chronic inflam­
matory conditions9–11. However, the role of these molecules during 
acute infection is less well understood. In previous studies, expres­
sion of CTLA­4 and PD­1 in T cells correlated with the extent of pro­ 
inflammatory responses against hantavirus and influenza virus 
among others12–14. Thus, we next evaluated the levels of pro­ and anti­ 
inflammatory cytokines in fatal and non­fatal EVD. In agreement with 
previous reports15,16, fatal EVD cases had significantly higher levels of 
serum pro­inflammatory cytokines (TNF (also known as TNFα) and 
IL­8) (Fig. 1d). Moreover, the levels of pro­inflammatory chemo 
kines 
(MIP­1α, MIP­1β and MCP1) were also significantly upregulated in 
fatalities (Fig. 1d). Levels of anti­inflammatory cytokines such as IL­10 
were also higher in fatalities suggesting the onset of compensatory 
homeostatic mechanisms in response to excessive inflammation, 
consistent with expression of T cell inhibitory molecules such as 
CTLA­4 and PD­1.
To gain insight into the correlation between CTLA­4 expression and 
the functional status of T cells in patients we performed analyses of 
 
T cells from cryopreserved peripheral blood leukocytes, which allowed 
evaluation of T cell marker co­expression (Extended Data Fig. 4). We 
used co­expression of CD38 and HLA­DR as well as CD38 and Ki­67 
to define activated T cells3,8,13, and co­expression of CTLA­4 and PD­1 
to identify effector T cells that had activated inhibitory mechanisms13. 
Our results indicated robust CD8+ T cell activation in both fatal and 
non­fatal EVD cases with no statistically significant difference between 
the two groups. The frequency of activated CD8+ T cells (around 30% 
of CD38+ HLA­DR+ and 18% of CD38+ Ki­67+) was similar to that 
previously reported in acute surviving medevac EVD patients3, and 
to that described in other acute infections13 and after vaccination8. 
However, the frequency of CD8+ T cells co­expressing PD­1 and 
CTLA­4 was significantly higher in fatalities (Fig. 2a, b). The results 
with CD4+ T cells corresponded to those of CD8+ T cells, with no 
differences in the activation status between fatal and non­fatal EVD, 
but a higher frequency of cells co­expressed CTLA­4 and PD­1 in fatal

cases (Fig. 2c, d). CTLA­4+ T cells in both CD8+ and CD4+ subsets 
expressed high levels of CD38 and HLA­DR, suggesting a discrete sub­
set of effector T cells that have initiated a compensatory homeostatic 
mechanism (Fig. 2b, d).
Whether or not CTLA­4 overexpression affects T cell­mediated 
viral clearance is controversial. While some reports have correlated 
 
the frequency of CD8+ T cells expressing CTLA­4 with poor viral 
 
clearance14, others do not support this hypothesis17. To explore the 
relationship between CTLA­4 and PD­1 expression and virus loads 
during EVD, we analysed whether the percentage of T cells express­
ing CTLA­4, PD­1, or both, correlated with the threshold cycle (Ct) 
values of the EBOV real­time PCR. Fatal EVD cases had signifi­
cantly lower Ct values at the time of admission in agreement with the 
Ct value being a strong predictor of outcome18–20 (Extended Data 
 
Fig. 2c–e). The Ct value negatively correlated with the percentage 
 
of T cells expressing CTLA­4 as well as the percentage of CD8+ T 
cells co­expressing CTLA­4 and PD­1 (Fig. 2e and Extended Data 
Fig. 5a). However, the percentage of T cells expressing PD­1 alone 
did not correlate with the Ct value (Fig. 2f). In summary, expression 
of CTLA­4 alone and in combination with PD­1 correlated with high 
viraemia.
Acute lymphopenia triggers proliferation of naive T cells with very 
low expression of CTLA­4 and PD­1 (ref. 21). Thus, we reasoned that 
differences in Ebola virus (EBOV)­induced lymphopenia2, could be a 
confounding variable in our study. However, there were no differences 
in circulating peripheral blood T cells between fatal and non­fatal EVD 
cases (Extended Data Fig. 5b). A recent study comparing infection 
with the Makona versus Mayinga variants of EBOV in non­human 
primates found evidence of initial leukocytosis followed by moder­
ate lymphopenia with no overall differences between both EBOV 
 
variants22. Initial leukocytosis in patients infected with the Makona 
variant of EBOV has been also observed23,24, which indicates the need 
of longitudinal evaluation of haematological parameters in patients 
infected with EBOV Makona, an approach that was not possible in 
our study due to the lack of statistically relevant numbers of fatal cases 
with longitudinal sampling.

To link the observed activation of CD8+ T cells with EBOV­specific 
responses, we sought to track EBOV­specific CD8+ T cells during 
infection through the use of HLA class I dextramers. We first per­
formed in silico analysis of EBOV nucleoprotein­derived peptides 
predicted to bind with high affinity to selected HLA alleles common 
in West Africa (HLA­A*02:01, HLA­A*23:01 and HLA­B*35:01)25 
and designed dextramers (Extended Data Fig. 6). We chose the EBOV 
nucleoprotein based on previous reports indicating that nucleoprotein 
drives most of the CD8+ T cell response26,27. Dextramer­matching 
HLA alleles were identified in 26 patients via sequencing of the HLA 
locus. Six patients had more than one sample for longitudinal evalua­
tion of EBOV­specific T cell responses. These included two fatal cases 
(F1 and F2) and four survivors (S2–S5). S3 and S4 were treated with 
favipiravir, and all the other patients received only supportive therapy. 
At the time of admission, the differences in the percentage of EBOV­
specific T cells between fatalities and survivors were not statistically 
significant (Fig. 3a). However, differences became evident during later 
stages of infection. The fatal cases with longitudinal sampling (F1 and 
F2) showed a high frequency of PD­1+ CTLA­4+ CD8+ T cells until 
death, but barely detectable EBOV­specific CD8+ T cells (Fig. 3b, e). In 
contrast, an increase in the frequency of EBOV­specific CD8+ T cells 
 
was observed in survivors in coincidence with virus clearance and 
decrease of the PD­1+ CTLA­4+ CD8+ T cell population (Fig. 3c–e).
These findings were substantiated by the kinetics of CTLA­4 
expression in two EVD patients, one fatality and one survivor, evac­
uated to Europe, as well as five survivors treated in Coyah, Guinea. 
Longitudinal analysis of these patients revealed persistent upregula­
tion of CTLA­4 in the fatal case and transient upregulation in survi­
vors (Extended Data Fig. 7). Of note, the increase of EBOV­specific 
 
T cells in the surviving patients coincided with contraction rather than 
expansion of the CD38+ HLA­DR+ subset (Fig. 3e). Despite the fact 
that the phenotype of activated T cells (CD38+ HLA­DR+) suggests 
engagement of the T cell receptor (TCR) and not bystander T cell 
 
activation8, our findings may point to the presence of non­EBOV­ 
specific T cells within the CD38+ HLA­DR+ compartment.
The main hypothesis we formulate on the basis of these data is that 
differences between the T cell response of fatal and surviving EVD 
patients are centred in the mechanisms that regulate T cell home­
ostasis. While all patients showed T cell activation irrespective of 
outcome, it was the expression of the regulatory molecules CTLA­4 
and PD­1 on peripheral blood T cells that marked fatal EVD and cor­
related with high viraemia, a known predictor of poor outcome19,20. 
We hypothesize that this upregulation reflects a compensatory mech­
anism to excess inflammatory stimuli, which is consistent with the 
concomitant expression of pro­inflammatory cytokines in fatal cases. 
However, our findings do not indicate causality between expression

RESEARCH
of CTLA­4/PD­1 and poor outcome: on one hand it is possible that 
high viraemia triggers overwhelming inflammation thereby causing 
CTLA­4 and PD­1 upregulation on T cells, and on the other hand, 
it is plausible to assume that expression of these molecules inhibits 
 
T cell function leading to poor viral clearance. Indeed, both possi­
bilities have been reported in the literature13,28 and their elucidation 
requires evaluation of CTLA­4 function during EVD in adequate 
infection models. Interestingly, during severe EVD, both PD­1 and 
CTLA­4 are upregulated while in other acute human infections such as 
hantavirus disease and paediatric influenza, only CTLA­4, not PD­1, 
was upregulated13,14. These results suggest that different infections 
trigger specific regulatory mechanisms, the balance of which is vital 
for optimal T cell function. Robust T cell activation was observed in 
both fatal and non­fatal EVD cases as reflected by similar levels of 
discrete CD8+ and CD4+ T cells co­expressing CD38 and HLA­DR. 
These results are in agreement with the strong T cell activation 
observed in surviving US patients3 and strengthen the notion that 
EVD is characterized by immune activation. Although limited, our 
dextramer data suggest that both fatal and non­fatal cases are able to 
mount EBOV­specific T cell responses. However, while in survivors 
the PD­1+ CTLA­4+ CD8+ T cell compartment contracted in con­
junction with viral clearance, formation of EBOV­specific T cells and 
recovery, this did not seem to be the case in fatal EVD. One plausible 
explanation for this finding is that the high expression of CTLA­4 
observed in activated T cells of fatal cases promotes cell extrinsic inhi­
bition of EBOV­specific T cells. T­cell­extrinsic CTLA­4 functions 
have been demonstrated in vivo and involve different mechanisms 
such as stripping of T cell co­stimulatory molecules from antigen­ 
presenting cells, stimulation of regulatory T cells and local tryptophan 
starvation among others5,29,30. Further functional experiments with 
adequate in vivo models are needed to explore the role of regulatory 
 
T cell molecules during EVD and to test whether their modulation 
may serve as a putative post­exposure therapy against EVD.

METHODS
No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. The experiments 
were not randomized and the investigators were not blinded to allocation during 
experiments and outcome assessment.
Patients. EVD patients included in the study were managed at the Ebola 
Treatment Centers in Guéckédou (n = 47) and Coyah (n = 157) under the med­
ical care of Médecins sans Frontières and doctors deployed by the Cuban gov­
ernment, respectively. Patients with malaria co­infection were excluded from the 
study. Two patients evacuated into Europe for medical treatment were included 
in the study for longitudinal analysis. One patient was treated at the University 
Medical Center Hamburg­Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany, and the other one at 
the Hospital La Paz, Madrid, Spain. Demographic and outcome data for EVD 
patients were obtained from databases of the World Health Organization. The 
National Committee of Ethics in Medical Research of Guinea as well as the Ethics 
Committee of the Medical Association of Hamburg approved the use of diagnostic 
leftover samples and corresponding patient data for this study (permits Nº11/
CNERS/14 and PV4910). This study was also approved by the protocol review 
office of the US National Cancer Institute institutional review board. As the sam­
ples had been collected as part of the public health response to contain the outbreak 
in Guinea, informed consent was not obtained from patients. Informed consent 
was obtained from the two EVD patients treated in Hamburg and Madrid.
Study samples and flow cytometry analysis. Real­time RT–PCR was performed 
on EDTA­blood of patients with suspected EVD using the RealStar Ebolavirus 
RT–PCR Kit 1.0 (Altona Diagnostics) at the European Mobile Laboratory (EMLab) 
units in Guéckédou and Coyah. Malaria was diagnosed using a rapid test. Whole 
blood samples from Guéckédou were shipped to the biosafety level 4 (BSL­4) lab­
oratory in Hamburg within 1–3 weeks after collection and processed immediately 
upon arrival via multiparametric flow cytometry.
Leftover samples from Coyah were shipped within 24 h after collection to the 
EMLab immunology laboratory at Donka Hospital in Conakry. PBMCs were iso­
lated after sedimentation of cells in EDTA whole blood tubes. Red blood cells were 
lysed with Red Blood Cell Lysing buffer (BD Biosciences). PBMCs were processed 
immediately upon reception for immunophenotypic analysis or were cryopre­
served and transported to the BSL­4 laboratory in Hamburg. Immune pheno­
typing was achieved via multiparametric flow cytometry panel using a battery 
of commercially available antibodies as follows: anti­human (h) CD3­APCCy7 
(clone UCHT1), anti­hCD4­FITC (clone OKT4), anti­hCD8­PeCy7 (clone 
RPAT8), anti­hCD152 (CTLA­4)­PE (clone L3D10), anti­hCD279 (PD­1)­APC 
(clone EH12­2HT), anti­hHLA­DR­PerCP Cy5.5 (clone L243), anti­hKi67­PE 
(clone 16A8), anti­hCD38­APC (clone HB­7). All antibodies were from Biolegend. 
Single­cell PBMC suspensions were incubated with live/dead discrimination dye 
(Zombie­NIR from Biolegend) followed by FACS block (Human TruStain Fc 
receptor blocking antibodies from Biolegend) for 20 min followed by staining 
with antibodies against extracellular antigens. After extracellular staining samples 
were inactivated in Cytofix/Cytoperm (BD) buffer in the presence of 4% formal­
dehyde followed by staining with intracellular antibodies (anti­CD3, Ki­67 and 
CTLA­4). Sample acquisition was done in a Guava easyCyte 8 Flow Cytometer 
 
from Millipore in Guinea. In Hamburg, samples were thawed at 37 °C and the 
sample volume transferred to ice­cold 15­ml falcon tubes where 5 ml ice­cold R8 
medium (RPMI + 8% FBS) were added. Sample tubes were then centrifuged to 
remove the cryopreservant (10% DMSO) at 1,000 r.p.m. for 10 min and resus­
pended in R8 medium. Samples were centrifuged once more and the pelleted 
cells were washed with 12 ml of ice­cold R8 medium. Samples were processed 
as indicated above. In experiments involving dextramer staining, samples 
were incubated in a volume of 50 μl of PBS with 5 μl of the indicate dextramers 
 
(1:10 dilution) before extracellular antibody staining. All dextramers were pur­
chased from Immudex. Samples were acquired in a LSR Fortessa instrument (BD). 
Flow cytometry analysis was done with FlowJO software (Treestar).
In silico peptide analysis. Prediction of EBOV nucleoprotein­derived peptide 
binding to selected human HLA alleles was achieved using an artificial neural 
network method at the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource (IEDB) 
(http://www.iedb.org). Selected peptides (IC50 < 50 nM) were then cross­checked 
with two additional matrix­prediction algorithms, BIMAS (http://www­bimas.
cit.nih.gov) and SYFPEITHI (http://www.syfpeithi.de). Peptides predicted by all 
three bioinformatic tools were selected and screened for similarity to the human 
genome using the NIH Blast server. Peptides showing homology to the human 
proteome were discarded.
Multiplex ELISA. Concentrations of selected cytokines and chemokines were 
measured in 1:2 diluted plasma samples using Milliplex Map Human Cytokine/
Chemokine Magnetic Bead Panel (EMD Millipore, Missouri, USA) on the 
Luminex platform LX200 (Luminex, Austin, USA). The procedure was performed 
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
HLA genotyping. High­resolution genotyping for HLA class I loci was performed 
by PCR­sequence­based typing, as recommended by the 13th International 
Histocompatibility Workshop (available at: http://www.ihwg.org). HLA sequences 
were analysed using the ASSIGN software (Conexio Genomics).
Statistical analysis. Non­parametric statistics and plots were performed in 
Graphpad Prism software as described in the figure legends. Sample distribution 
is illustrated throughout the manuscript using box­and­whisker plots. In all figures 
the boxes extend from the 25th to 75th percentiles and the horizontal bar is plotted 
as the median. The bars (whiskers) represent sample distribution down to the 10th 
percentile (lower bar) and up to the 90th percentile (upper bar).

significance was tested by non­parametric Spearman correlation analysis. 
e, Ct values correlated negatively with symptom scoring, so that low  
Ct values were associated with severe disease symptoms. Symptom score 
was calculated as the summation of individual symptoms (bleeding, liver 
dysfunction, respiratory distress, kidney failure, neurological symptoms 
and anorexia) from ‘0’ (no symptoms) to ‘6’ (all symptoms present).  
In the box­and­whisker plot the ends of the whiskers represent the 10th
