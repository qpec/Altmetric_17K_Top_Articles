Objective: The purpose of the present study was to address
1) whether exercise provides protection against new-onset
depression and anxiety and 2) if so, the intensity and amount
of exercise required to gain protection and, lastly, 3) the
mechanisms that underlie any association.
Method: A “healthy” cohort of 33,908 adults, selected on the
basis of having no symptoms of common mental disorder
or limiting physical health conditions, was prospectively
followed for 11 years. Validated measures of exercise, de-
pression, anxiety, and a range of potential confounding and
mediating factors were collected.
Results: Undertaking regular leisure-time exercise was as-
sociated with reduced incidence of future depression but not
anxiety. The majority of this protective effect occurred at low
levels of exercise and was observed regardless of intensity.
Afteradjustmentforconfounders,thepopulationattributable
fraction suggests that, assuming the relationship is causal,
12% of future cases of depression could have been prevented
if all participants had engaged in at least 1 hour of physical
activity each week. The social and physical health benefits of
exercise explained a small proportion of the protective effect.
Previously proposed biological mechanisms, such as alter-
ations in parasympathetic vagal tone, did not appear to have a
role in explaining the protection against depression.
Conclusions: Regular leisure-time exercise of any intensity
providesprotectionagainstfuturedepressionbutnotanxiety.
Relatively modest changes in population levels of exercise
may have important public mental health benefits and pre-
vent a substantial number of new cases of depression.

The rising costs associated with depression and anxiety con-
stitute a major public health problem across the developed and
developing world (1). While the need to address the growing
burden of these common mental disorders is not in doubt,
there has been little consensus on how this should be executed.
Although effective treatments are available, cost-effectiveness
models suggest that even in the unlikely event of optimal treat-
ment being delivered in all cases, only 35%–50% of the overall
burden of depression and anxiety would be alleviated (2). As a
result, a number of agencies have begun to consider strategies
aimed at primary prevention of both depression and anxiety.
Rose (3) argued that the most appropriate method for pre-
venting common, multifactorial diseases is to shift the entire
populationdistributionofknownriskfactors.Suchstrategiesare
well established for the prevention of other conditions, such as
cardiovascular disease. However, most of the known risk factors
for depression and anxiety, such as familial risk, socioeconomic
position, and life events, are difficult or impossible to modify (4).
There is, however, some emerging evidence that lifestyle
factors, such as physical inactivity, may be potential targets
for strategies aimed at preventing depression and anxiety
(5, 6). A variety of health surveys have demonstrated a cross-
sectional association between exercise and lower rates of
both depressionand anxiety (7, 8). However, the possibility of
reverse causation (low mood or anxiety leading to reduced
levels of exercise) has limited the interpretation of such
studies. To date, the results of prospective studies have been
more mixed. Some studies have found no prospective asso-
ciation between levels of exercise and depression and anxiety
(9–11), while others have suggested that any beneficial effects
of exercise may be limited to certain subgroups or age groups,
or only associated with intensive exercise (12–14). The evi-
dence base has been further confused by many, but not all, of
the published reports conflating depression and anxiety dis-
orders, despite each having unique risk factors and distinct
biological processes (15). The evidence base for exercise as a
treatment for current depression is more established, with
numerous reviews concluding that exercise is moderately
effective for reducing the symptoms of depression (16, 17).
Recent analyses of the data used in these reviews have added

 further evidence for the antidepressant effect of exercise,
withfindingsthat bothpublicationbiasandenhancedcontrol
group responses may have led to an underestimate of the true
effect sizeof exerciseas an interventionin depression(18, 19).
However, systematic reviews of the evidence for exercise
in preventing new-onset depression and/or anxiety have
neededtobemoretemperedintheirconclusions,particularly
regardingtherelativeimportanceoftheintensityandamount
of exercise required to convey any protective effect (20).
A number of theories have been proposed as to how ex-
ercise may prevent mental illness, yet to date none of these
have been formally evaluated in prospective epidemiological
studies (5). Exercise is associated with a number of biolog-
ical changes that could have an impact on mental health. One
purported biological mechanism is alteration in the activity
of the autonomic nervous system (21, 22). Regular exercise
increases parasympathetic vagal tone, leading to physiological
changes such as resting bradycardia (23). Alterations in auto-
nomic nervous system activity have been observed in those
sufferingfromdepression,andvagalnervestimulationhasbeen
used to treat depression (21). Other explanations for any as-
sociationbetweenexerciseanddepressionandanxietyfocuson
the physical health, self-esteem, or social benefits of exercise.
Addressing the uncertainty surrounding the relationship
between exercise and depression and anxiety is important.
While many agencies are keen to promote the potential men-
tal health benefits of exercise, at present the literature is
unable to provide the most basic information needed for
effective, targeted, evidence-based public health campaigns
concerning depression and anxiety. The aim of the present
study was to utilize a large (N=33,908) prospective cohort to
address threequestions. First, doesexercise provide protection
against new-onset depression and anxiety? Second, if so, what
intensity and total amount of exercise is required to gain
protection? Third, what causal mechanisms underlie any as-
sociation between exercise and later depression and anxiety?
METHOD
Study Design
The HUNT study [Health Study of Nord-Trøndelag County]
represents one of the largest and most comprehensive
population-based health surveys everundertaken.The Nord-
Trøndelag County of Norway covers a mainly rural area, with
a total population of 127,000 at the time of the study com-
mencement. In phase 1 (HUNT 1) of the study, conducted
between January 1984 and February 1986, all inhabitants of
the county aged 20 years or older (N=85,100) were invited to
complete questionnaires on their lifestyle and medical his-
tory and to attend a physical examination. A total of 74,599
individuals participated (87.7%). All participants were then
followed up 9 to 13 years later (between August 1995 andJune
1997) in phase 2 of the study (HUNT 2). Detailed information
on the HUNT cohort study has been published elsewhere
(24, 25). The STROBE [Strengthening the Reporting of Ob-
servational studies in Epidemiology] checklist (see appendix
SA1 in the data supplement accompanying the online version
of this article) was followed throughout the study.
Selection of a “Healthy” Sample
In order to be more confident regarding the direction of any
associations found, data from HUNT 1 were used to select a
“healthy” cohort, without any evidence of current physical
illness or depressive or anxiety disorders at baseline.
Symptoms of depression and anxiety at baseline. The presence
of depression and anxiety at baseline (HUNT 1) was detected
in two ways. Firstly, all participants completed the 12-item
Anxiety and Depression Symptom Index. This measure,
designed to capture a range of symptoms suggestive of de-
pression and anxiety, has been validated and shown to have a
good test-retest correlation (26, 27). A total of 60,980 respon-
dents (81.7%) returned an adequately completed questionnaire.
Previously, a cut-off at the 80th percentile of the total score on
the questionnaire has been used to define caseness (28). In
order to be more conservative in creating a “healthy” cohort,
only those falling below the 70th percentile of the total score
were selected (N=42,686). Secondly, participants were also
asked whether they suffered from any impairments due to
psychological complaints. An additional 726 individuals who
indicated baseline psychological impairments were excluded.
Assessment of physical health at baseline. Physical ill-health
may prevent individuals from participating in exercise and is
an independent predictor of common mental disorders (29).
Participants were asked whether they suffered from any
impairments with regard to motor abilities or impairments
due to physical illness, or suffered from, or had ever been
diagnosed with, diabetes, angina, myocardial infarction,
stroke, or cerebral hemorrhage. Consequently, an additional
8,444 participants were excluded, yielding a final “healthy”
cohort of 33,908 individuals.
Measurement of Exercise at Baseline
At the time of their baseline assessment (HUNT 1), all par-
ticipants were asked how often they engaged in exercise (such
as walking or swimming). They were provided with five op-
tions: 1) never, 2) less than once a week, 3) once a week, 4) two
tothreetimesaweek,and5)nearlyeveryday.Participantswere
asked, on average, how long they exercised on each occasion.
By combining the answers for both of these questions, it was
possible to produce an estimate of the total number of minutes
per week each individual spent exercising. Participants were
also asked about the intensity of their exercise, with three
possible options: 1) exercise without becoming breathless or
sweating,2)exerciseresultinginbreathlessnessandsweating,
or 3) exercise resulting in near exhaustion. The last two
options were combined into one category.
The reliability and validity of these questions and a
composite total time spent engaging in exercise per week
have been demonstrated against three additional objective
measures of physical activity: maximal oxygen uptake,

 measures of body position and motion over 7 days using an
ActiReg recordinginstrument,andtheInternationalPhysical
Activity Questionnaire (30).
Assessment of Depression and Anxiety in HUNT 2
At follow-up (HUNT 2), all participants were asked to
complete the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (31).
The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale is a self-report
questionnaire comprising 14 4-point Likert-scale items
covering anxiety and depression symptoms over the previous
2 weeks. A cut-off score of 8 in each subscale (anxiety sub-
scale, depression subscale) has been found to be optimal for
case finding, with sensitivity and specificity estimates of
around 0.80 (32).
Potential Confounding and Mediating Variables
In order to facilitate the differentiating of confounders
and mediators, a conceptual hierarchical framework (see
Figure 1) was constructed a priori to outline how various
factorsmay relatetobothexercise anddepression andanxiety.
Demographic and socioeconomic factors. Information on
participants’ age, gender, and marital status was obtained from
the Norwegian National Population Registry. Participants
were asked to record their highest completed education level.
Occupational social class was calculated according to the In-
ternationalErikson-Goldthorpe-Portocarerosclassification(33).
Substance use. Participants were asked to report the total
number of cigarettes consumed per day and how frequently
they drank alcohol, with five options ranging from total
abstainer to 10 or more times in the past week.
Body-mass index (BMI). A specially trained nurse took
measurements calculating the BMI of each participant.
New-onset physical illness. The same somatic conditions and
limitations that were considered at baseline as exclusion
measures were also assessed at follow-up, allowing the
identification of any new-onset illnesses or impairments
throughout the course of the study.
Autonomic nervous system activity. Lowered resting pulse is
a biological adaptation to regular exercise (34), due to in-
creased parasympathetic vagal tone (23). At the HUNT
1 physical examination, each participant’s resting pulse was
measured after at least 4 minutes of rest in the sitting position
by palpation over the radial artery for 15 seconds.
Perceived social support. Each participant’s perceived social
support (both instrumental and emotional) was assessed via a
single question: “If you fell ill and had to stay in bed for a
significant period, how likely do you think it is that you would
get the necessary help and support from family, friends, or
neighbors?” Five options were provided: 1) very likely, 2)
quite likely, 3) doubtful, 4) unlikely, 5) not likely at all.
Statistical Analysis
All analyses were conducted using STATA statistical soft-
ware, Version 10.1 (StataCorp, College Station, Tex.) (35). A
multiple imputation model was constructed to replace
missing values using the imputation by chained approach
method. Thirty imputed data sets were created. All variables
used in the analyses were included in the imputation model.
Sensitivity analyses utilizing complete case analysis were
undertaken to ensure results were not significantly altered by
the multiple imputation process.
The associations between level of physical activity and
both depression and anxiety were assessed using univariate
and then multivariate logistic regression. The total amount of
exercise undertaken each week was divided into six cate-
gories ranging from none up to more than 4 hours. The
relative confounding effect of each of the variables outlined
above wasexamined in turn, before a final multivariate model
containing all potential confounders was constructed. In-
teractions by gender, age subgroup, and exercise intensity
were tested using postestimation Wald tests. The correlation
between levels of exercise at baseline and follow-up was
examined using Spearman’s rank-order correlation tests. In
addition to reporting odds ratios, the relative importance of

EXERCISE AND THE PREVENTION OF DEPRESSION
 exercise in predicting future depression and anxiety was
examined using population attributable fractions.
Finally, the importance of the following three potential
mediating factors was considered: 1) new-onset physical
illness, 2) autonomic nervous system activity (resting pulse),
and 3) the level of perceived social support. Although a
“healthy” cohort was selected for this study, the possibility of
reverse causation remained, with subthreshold symptoms of
depression and anxiety leading to reduced levels of exercise.
Therefore, a fourth potential pathway, reverse causation, was
also considered. The associations between each of the four
potential mediating factors and both exercise level and levels
of depression and anxiety were examined using linear re-
gression, before the effect of adding each potential mediating
factor to a final model was assessed.
Ethics
Both the HUNT 1 and HUNT 2 phases of the study were
approved by the National Data Inspectorate and the Board of
Research Ethics in Health Region IV of Norway.
RESULTS
Characteristics of the Study Sample
The characteristics of the “healthy” cohort of 33,908 indi-
viduals are summarized in Table 1. Of these, 22,564 (66.5%)
were successfully followed up at the HUNT 2 phase. Females
(p,0.001) and younger participants (p,0.0001) were more
likely to be followed up. The frequency of exercise un-
dertakenat baseline did not predict loss to follow-up once the
effect of gender and age was considered (p=0.19). Of the
22,564 individuals followed up, 1,578 (7.0%) developed case-
level symptoms of depression, and 1,972 (8.7%) developed
case-level symptoms of anxiety. All participants gave their
informed consent to participate in this study.
Exercise at Baseline and New-Onset Depression
and Anxiety
There was a negative relationship between the total amount
of exercise undertaken at baseline and risk of future de-
pression (p=0.001). In contrast, the prevalence of case-level
anxiety was similar regardless of the levels of baseline ex-
ercise (p=0.21). Logistic regression models of the associations
between the total amount of exercise at baseline and later
depression and anxiety are displayed in Table 2. After ad-
justment for a range of confounders, those who reported
undertaking no exercise at baseline had a 44% (95% confi-
dence interval=17%–78%) increased odds of developing case-
level depression compared with those who were exercising
1–2 hours a week. The models presented in Table 2 confirm
the lack of any association between baseline exercise levels
and later case-level anxiety (p=0.27).
There was no evidence of interaction by gender (all
p values .0.2) or when stratified by age group (greater than
or less than 50 years old, p=0.96) in the association between
the total amount of exercise at baseline and later case-level
depression or anxiety. A similar significant association was
seen between baseline levels of exercise and later depression
in those aged less than 50 years (p=0.04) and those aged
50 years and older (p=0.03). As expected, there was a sig-
nificant correlation between the amount of exercise un-
dertaken at baseline and follow-up (p,0.001).

 Dose-Response Relationship
Visual representations of the dose-response relationship
between total exercise at baseline and the odds of later case-
level depression are provided in Figure 2. Most of the pro-
tective effect of exercise is realized with relatively low levels
of exercise, with no indication of any additional benefit be-
yond 1 hour of exercise each week. Maximum likelihood ratio
tests suggest that an exponential decay model (with de-
creasing benefit as the total time of exercise increases) was a
better fit for the data than a linear model (test for difference
between models, p=0.004). The combined population at-
tributable fraction for less than 1 hour of exercise per week
was 11.9%. There was no ev-
idence of an interaction by
intensityofexercise(p=0.96).
Possible Mediating
Pathways
In line with a priori predic-
tions, those who engaged in
lessexerciseatbaselinetended
to have higher resting pulse,
lower levels of perceived
social support, and more sub-
threshold symptoms of de-
pression and anxiety, and they
were more likely to develop
new-onset physical illnesses
over the course of the study
(p,0.001). Table 3 demon-
strates that three of the four
potential mediating pathways
considered accounted for
some of the observed associa-
tion: reverse causation, lower
levels of perceived social sup-
port, and new-onset physical
illness. However, each of these
modeled pathways explained
only a very small proportion
of the observed effect, with
the majority of the protective
effect of exercise remaining
unaccounted for by measured
factors.
DISCUSSION
Using a large population co-
hort study, we have observed
that relatively small amounts
of exercise can provide sig-
nificant protection against
future depression but not
anxiety. This protective ef-
fect was seen equally across
all groups, regardless of the intensity of exercise that was
undertakenorthegenderorageoftheparticipants.Assuming
there is no residual confounding in our final model and the
observed relationship is causal, our results suggest that if all
participants had exercised for at least 1 hour each week, 12%
of the cases of depression at follow-up could have been
prevented.
The key strengths of this study are its large sample size,
prospective data collection, use of validated measures of
physical activity and mental disorder, and the detailed in-
formation available on a wide range of potential confounding
and mediating factors. Despite these strengths, the analyses

EXERCISE AND THE PREVENTION OF DEPRESSION
 presented have some important limitations. Regarding the
study design, while individuals reporting current symptoms
and/or impairment of depression or anxiety at baseline were
excluded using a two-step process, we were not able to ex-
clude individuals with a history of prior episodes of de-
pressionandanxiety.Thus,itispossiblethatsomeindividuals
withalifetimehistoryofdepressionoranxiety mayhavebeen
included in the “healthy” cohort, and thus a proportion of the
future cases may be recurrent episodes of depression or
anxiety. While the long follow-up time is a strength, the use of
a single measure of a relapsing and remitting condition such
as depression means that some misclassification will have
occurred. Such misclassification is likely to be random and
therefore results in regression dilution bias and an attenu-
ation of effect sizes. This has important consequences for the
interpretation of the results and suggests that the actual
protective effect of exercise may be even greater than that
reported in this study. The measurement of exercise at
a single time point will also have created some misclas-
sification, although there was a significant correlation
between levels of exercise at baseline and follow-up. The ma-
jority of other limitations relate to the measures used. While
the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale is one of the most
widely used and validated measures of depression and anxiety,
the operationalization of any mental disorder via a self-report
screening tool cannot be considered equivalent to a clinical
diagnosis, and a risk of misclassification remains. Similarly,
while the measures of exercise used have been extensively
validated (30), they remain reliant on self-report, and each
factor considered in the analysis of mediation was measured
with a single item that may not have fully captured the con-
structs being considered. In addition to standard regression,
population attributable fractions were used to describe the
relative importance of exercise as a possible preventative
strategy. Population attributable fractions can be a useful way
to help guide public health interventions, but any estimates of
populationattributablefractionsassumeacausalrelationship
with no residual confounding. While attempts were made to
account for many confounders, a number of important po-
tential confounding variables, such as personality, attitude
toward health, diet, seasonal weather variations, and the
degree to which each participant’s local environment is con-
ducive to regular exercise, remained unmeasured. Nord-
Trøndelag County is situated between northern latitudes 63°
and 65°. As a result, there is considerable seasonal variation in
the number of daylight hours. Previous studies have shown an
associated seasonal variation in depression prevalence within
Nord-Trøndelag County, with higher rates of depression be-
tween December and April (36). If rates of physical activity
were also lower in the winter months, then the confounding
effect of the season at the time of assessment could affect any
observed cross-sectional association between exercise and
depression. However, this longitudinal study mitigates against
this by the fact that there was no link between the seasonal
timing of the assessments in HUNT 1 (when exercise levels
were measured) and HUNT2 (when levels of depression were
assessed). The invitation for participation in the HUNT
2phasewas senttoallresidentsofthecountyatatimethatwas
unrelated to when each individual had been assessed during
the HUNT 1 phase. The equal popularity of both winter and
summer sports in Norway may also have reduced the possi-
bility of seasonal confounding.
This study represents, to our knowledge, the largest and
most detailed modeling of the prospective dose-response
relationship between exercise and depression and the first
published epidemiological exploration of the causal path-
ways involved. In addition to confirming that more active
individuals are less likelyto develop depression, we wereable
to demonstrate that this was most accurately modeled as an
exponential decay model, with decreasing benefit as the total
time spent exercising increases. This supports and expands
on the tentative conclusions from a review published in 2014,
which highlighted that substantial mental health benefits
may be gained from relatively moderate levels of exercise
(37). Importantly, the majority of the protective effects of
exercise against depression are realized within the first hour
ofexerciseundertakeneachweek,whichprovidessomeclues
regarding causation and has major implications for poss-
ible future public mental health campaigns. The majority of
studies examining the role of physical activity in prevent-
ing cardiovascular disease have found that the beneficial
cardiovascular effects continue to increase up to around 2–3
hours of exercise per week (38, 39). Thus, while there are
similarities in the overall shape of the dose-response re-
lationship between exercise and depression and exercise and
somatic illness, the level of activity needed to realize the bulk
of the possible protective effects are very different. Our
finding that more vigorous-intensity exercise had no addi-
tional protective effects against future case-level depression
is also in contrast to previous findings regarding protective
factors against cardiovascular disease (39).

HARVEY ET AL.
 Taken together, these results suggest that processes such
as alterations in autonomic nervous system activity and
modification of metabolic factors, which require more reg-
ular or strenuous exercise, may be less important when
considering the protective effects of exercise against future
depressiveillness.Inkeepingwiththishypothesis,ourresults
suggest that the perceived social benefits of exercise may
mediate some of the protective effects against depression.
However, within our analysis, the increased levels of per-
ceived social support accounted for only a small proportion
of the effect observed, meaning the bulk of the observed
protective effect remains unexplained. Peo-
ple’s perception of their social support may be
subject to bias relating to their current mental
state. This type of reporting bias could lead
to an overestimate of the mediating effect of
perceived social support, meaning an even
greater proportion of the observed protective
effect of exercise may be unexplained. We
propose two possible explanations to account
for the unexplained protective effect of ex-
ercise. Firstly, the remaining prospective as-
sociations may be due to confounding from
factors not measured, such as shared genetic
factors, personality, or individual attitudes
toward health (40). Secondly, or alternatively,
theremay beothercausal factorsnot measured
in this study, such as changes in self-esteem,
serotonin release (41), increased expression of
neuroprotectiveproteinssuchasbrain-derived
neurotropic factor, altered hippocampal neu-
rogenesis,ormodificationstotheactivitylevels
of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis
(42). The lack of any association between ex-
ercise and future anxiety disorders suggests
that the link between exercise and depression
is not merely related to a general increase in
mentalwell-beingandisunlikelytoinvolverisk
factorssharedbetweendepressionandanxiety.
Despite the remaining uncertainty re-
garding causal pathways, the findings pre-
sented in this study have important public
healthimplications. Thereisevidencethat the
levels of exercise in the general population in
developed countries have decreased consid-
erably over the recent decades (43), with
similar trends now also being observed in
developing countries. The results of this study
indicatethatrelativelymodestincreasesinthe
overall amount of time spent exercising per
week may be able to prevent a substantial
number of new cases of depression. If cau-
sality is assumed and there are no other major
cofounders, our results suggest that at least
12% of new cases of depression could be
prevented if all adults participated in at least
1 hour of exercise each week. While education regarding the
higher levels of exercise required to achieve maximum
cardiovascular and metabolic benefits remains important,
informing individuals that significant mental health benefits
may be achieved with small changes in their behavior may be
valuable in facilitating behavioral change. Given that the
intensity of exercise does not appear to be important, it may
be that the most effective public health measures are those
that encourage and facilitate increased levels of everyday
activities, such as walking or cycling. The results presented in
this study provide a strong argument in favor of further
