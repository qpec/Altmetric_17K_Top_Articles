The trial is sponsored by Amarin Pharma Inc.
Residual cardiovascular risk persists despite statins, yet outcome studies of lipid-targeted thera-
pies beyond low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) have not demonstrated added benefit.
Triglyceride elevation is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular events. High-dose eicosa-
pentaenoic acid (EPA) reduces triglyceride-rich lipoproteins without raising LDL-C. Omega-3s
have postulated pleiotropic cardioprotective benefits beyond triglyceride-lowering. To date, no
large, multinational, randomized clinical trial has proved that lowering triglycerides on top of
statin therapy improves cardiovascular outcomes. The Reduction of Cardiovascular Events with
Icosapent Ethyl–Intervention Trial (REDUCE-IT; NCT01492361) is a phase 3b randomized,
double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of icosapent ethyl, a highly purified ethyl ester of EPA,
vs placebo. The main objective is to evaluate whether treatment with icosapent ethyl reduces
ischemic events in statin-treated patients with high triglycerides at elevated cardiovascular risk.
REDUCE-IT enrolled men or women age ≥45 years with established cardiovascular disease or
age ≥50 years with diabetes mellitus and 1 additional risk factor. Randomization required fast-
ing triglycerides ≥150 mg/dL and <500 mg/dL and LDL-C >40 mg/dL and ≤100 mg/dL with
stable statin (� ezetimibe) ≥4 weeks prior to qualifying measurements. The primary endpoint is
a composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, coronary
revascularization, or unstable angina. The key secondary endpoint is the composite of cardio-
vascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke. Several secondary, tertiary,
and exploratory endpoints will be assessed. Approximately 8000 patients have been rando-
mized at approximately 470 centers worldwide. Follow-up will continue in this event-driven
trial until approximately 1612 adjudicated primary-efficacy endpoint events have occurred.

INTRODUCTION
Statin therapy has been well established as a cornerstone of cardio-
vascular prevention, and yet despite potent therapies for lowering
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), substantial residual risk
remains.1–3 Clinical and epidemiological studies have demonstrated
that triglyceride (TG) elevation is an independent risk factor for
increased cardiovascular (CV) events, and therefore may represent
one contributive factor of residual CV risk beyond statin therapy.1–11
More recently, elegant Mendelian randomization studies have sup-
ported a causal role for TG in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular dis-
ease (CVD), showing that elevated TG are not merely a risk marker,
but rather a risk factor and thus potentially modifiable.3 Despite the
available data, an important question that remains is whether treat-
ment of modest degrees of TG elevation would decrease CV events,
in particular in patients already receiving LDL-C–lowering therapy
with statins. Prior CV outcome studies that administered therapies
with TG-lowering effects (niacin or fenofibrate) on top of statin ther-
apy did not reach their primary endpoints. Nonetheless, these studies
also did not prospectively enroll patients with elevated TG levels
despite statin therapy,6,12–15 and subgroup analyses suggested possi-
ble benefits to TG lowering in patients with dyslipidemia.5,6
Outcome studies of relatively low doses of prescription omega-3
therapies in Japan (the Japan EPA Lipid Intervention Study [JELIS])16
and Italy (Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della Sopravvivenza nell’In-
farto miocardico [GISSI])17,18 have suggested that omega-3 therapy
may provide CV protection. However, these studies were performed
in single countries prior to current treatment guidelines, and there-
fore provide supportive but not conclusive evidence of CV benefit.
Other more recent omega-3 therapy outcome studies conducted in
the presence of statins have been less encouraging, but these studies
were characterized by evaluating nonhypertriglyceridemic patient
FIGURE 1
Study design for REDUCE-IT.
During the screening period, patients were
evaluated for inclusion/exclusion criteria. If
patients met the inclusion criteria at Visit
1, they were asked to return for the
randomization visit (Visit 2) and entered
the treatment/follow-up period. Patients
who were not eligible at Visit 1 but who
became eligible in the next 28 days (such
as patients whose statin dose changed at
Visit 1 and/or needed to wash out
prohibited medications) may have returned
for an optional second screening visit (Visit
1.1). Such patients entered a statin
stabilization/medication washout period of
≥28 days prior to rescreening. Patients
who were eligible following screening/
rescreening entered the treatment/follow-
up period, with follow-up visits occurring
at 4 months, 12 months, and annually
thereafter. *A study amendment (May
2013) was made, increasing the lower end
of the fasting TG level from ≥150 mg/dL
to ≥200 mg/dL to increase enrollment of
patients with TG ≥200 mg/dL; it is
anticipated that mean and median
qualifying TG levels will be >200 mg/dL.
†Final values to be known at study
unblinding. Event-driven design:
approximately 1612 primary efficacy
events will be required during the study;
study duration will vary accordingly.

and/or docosoahexaenoic acid [DHA]).19–24
Omega-3 therapies, including EPA, have been postulated to have
cardioprotective effects such as beneficial changes to TG and other
lipid and lipoprotein parameters (eg, non–high-density lipoprotein
cholesterol [non-HDL-C], apolipoprotein CIII), as well as other
potential benefits beyond plasma lipid modification.19,25–30 Icosapent

 United States by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as an
adjunct to diet to reduce TG levels in adult patients with severe
hypertriglyceridemia (≥500 mg/dL).25,26 In this range of very elevated
TG levels, reduction is considered to be clinically necessary to decrease
the risk of pancreatitis.
In addition to beneficial changes to TG-rich lipoproteins and
other plasma lipid markers, some clinical studies with higher-dose
EPA also suggest beneficial effects on markers of oxidation and
inflammation,
coronary
plaque
characteristics,
and
major
CV
events.16,25,26,29,31–33 For example, in contrast to the fenofibrate
and niacin studies, JELIS found a 19% relative risk reduction in
CV events in statin-treated patients with relatively normal TG but
a more pronounced 53% reduction in the subgroup with mixed
dyslipidemia, specifically TG ≥150 mg/dL and HDL-C <40 mg/
dL.4,16 Although confirmation of these results is needed in west-
ern populations, the reduction of CV events with EPA therapy in
a patient population with relatively normal TG levels suggests that
EPA
may
have
pleiotropic
effects
beyond
plasma-lipid
modification.
It is worth noting that the promising results from JELIS occurred
with a high-purity EPA preparation dosed at 1.8 g/d in a Japanese
population, for whom the baseline EPA levels are higher than in
western populations due to greater dietary intake of marine omega-
3 fatty acids. Icosapent ethyl 12-week dosing at 4 g/d in a high-risk
population similar to that within the Reduction of Cardiovascular
Events with Icosapent Ethyl–Intervention Trial (REDUCE-IT) who
had persistent elevations of TG after treatment with statins resulted
in significant reductions in TG and atherogenic lipoproteins,26–28 as
well as comparable plasma EPA levels as the 1.8 g/d dosing group
in JELIS.34 Therefore, a dose of 4 g/d was selected as the dose for
further study. In this context, REDUCE-IT was designed to deter-
mine if treatment with icosapent ethyl 4 g/d vs placebo would
reduce ischemic events in patients at increased CV risk already
being treated with statins.

nificant TG elevations. LDL-C levels needed to be >40 mg/dL and
≤100 mg/dL, with patients on stable statin therapy (� ezetimibe) for
≥4 weeks prior to the LDL-C and TG qualifying measurements for
randomization.
The primary endpoint is a composite of CV death, nonfatal myo-
cardial infarction (MI), nonfatal stroke, coronary revascularization, or
unstable angina. The key secondary endpoint is the composite of CV
death, nonfatal MI, or nonfatal stroke. Several other secondary, terti-
ary, and exploratory endpoints are being assessed (Table 3), which
were designed to provide additional insights into the potential effects
of EPA therapy on various outcomes and in distinct high-risk patient
populations.
The sample-size calculation was based on a hazard ratio assump-
tion of 0.85. Therefore, 1612 events would be required to have
approximately 90% power with a 1-sided α-level of 2.5% and with
2 interim analyses. This results in a total target sample size of 7990
patients. Approximately 70% of randomized patients were to be in
CV risk stratum 1 (established CVD) and approximately 30% of ran-
domized patients were to be in CV risk stratum 2 (high-risk primary
prevention defined by diabetes mellitus and other risk factors). Ran-
domization was stratified by CV risk strata, ezetimibe use, and by
geographical region.
The first patient was randomized on November 28, 2011. Proto-
col amendment 1 (May 2013) changed the lower limit of TG levels
for entry into the trial from 150 mg/dL to 200 mg/dL, as a majority
of the steering committee members felt that those were the patients
most likely to benefit from TG lowering. Protocol amendment 2 (July
2016) designated the composite of hard major adverse cardiovascular
events (CV death, nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke) as the “key secondary
endpoint” per suggestions from the FDA with steering committee
concordance. The last patient was randomized on August 4, 2016.
Approximately 8000 patients have been randomized at approximately
470 centers worldwide (see Supporting Information, Appendix, in the
online version of this article). Follow up will continue in this event-
driven trial until approximately 1612 adjudicated primary efficacy
endpoint events have occurred. This study is being conducted in
accordance with a special protocol assessment agreement with
the FDA.

DISCUSSION
Despite CV risk reduction through potent LDL-C–lowering therapies
such as statins, substantial residual CV risk remains. Epidemiological,
biological, and genetic studies have provided robust evidence of a
strong association between elevated TG levels and higher rates of CV
events.1–11 Furthermore, TG reduction lowers several inflammatory
markers associated with CV risk, and subgroup and post hoc analyses
of outcome studies suggest possible reductions in major CV events
with TG-lowering therapy.3–11 Finally, studies administering higher-
dose EPA suggest additional beneficial effects beyond lipid-lowering

 that may be unique to EPA relative to other TG-lowering therapies,
such as beneficial changes in coronary plaque characteristics, which
may lead to reductions in major CV events.4,16,25–33
However, randomized data from large outcome studies across
broad populations regarding pharmacological TG lowering and
effect on CV outcomes have been mixed (Table 4).1–24 Part of the
reason may involve differences between the classes of drugs stud-
ied, such as fibrates, niacin, and omega-3 fatty acids. Even among
omega-3 fatty acid studies, there are marked differences with
respect to the relatively low doses of omega-3 administered and
the ratio of EPA to DHA.16–24 In addition, different TG-lowering
therapies may exert differential effects across lipid profiles. For
example, fibrates and DHA-containing omega-3 fatty acid mixtures
have been shown to increase LDL-C, which in turn might adversely
influence trial results. Among outcome studies administering TG-
lowering agents beyond statin therapy, only the JELIS trial using
pure EPA demonstrated a significant reduction in CV events in
patients with relatively normal TG levels.16 The subgroup data
(Table 5) from the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabe-
tes (ACCORD) Lipid,6 Atherothrombosis Intervention in Metabolic
Syndrome with Low HDL/High Triglycerides and Impact on Global
Health Outcomes (AIM-HIGH),5 and JELIS4 trials further support a
prospective study of EPA in a broader patient population with
hypertriglyceridemia, as exemplified in REDUCE-IT, as a potential
add-on to statin therapy to reduce residual CV risk. That the lipid
changes in JELIS were relatively modest (ie, approximately a 5% TG
reduction) raises the possibility that other pleiotropic effects
beyond lipid lowering may have also contributed to the reduction
in CV risk.4,16 Finally, any benefits to TG-lowering therapies may be
most pronounced among statin-treated patients in the higher range
of TG elevation (ie, ≥200 mg/dL),4–6 for whom randomized pro-
spectively designed outcome studies have not been previously con-
ducted prior to the REDUCE-IT study.
REDUCE-IT is designed to evaluate whether treating at-risk
patients with high-dose EPA will lower the rates of important ische-
mic events beyond statin therapy. However, this trial alone will not
validate whether lowering TG specifically in patients with elevated
TG levels will result in lower rates of important ischemic events,
because the effects of EPA may be broader than TG reduction
alone. Several trials, including REDUCE-IT, are ongoing or planned
to determine if different TG-lowering therapies in patients with ele-
vated TG levels lower the rate of important ischemic events.35–38
The use of different therapeutic agents across these trials may in
aggregate help us better understand the relative importance of TG
lowering alone and may also help define which potential effects
observed in REDUCE-IT might be uniquely attributable to EPA
therapy. Several lines of data, including comparison of the JELIS
study results to those of fibrate and niacin outcome studies, sug-
gest that EPA may be differentiated from other TG-lowering agents
as statin add-on therapy, by potentially providing unique pleiotropic
cardioprotective benefits in addition to TG lowering.
Other changes in the lipid-lowering field may also affect the
interpretation of the ongoing REDUCE-IT trial. For example, the
proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors are being
tested in large CV outcome trials of patients for whom LDL-C

 control from statin (� ezetimibe) therapy may be insufficient or
poorly tolerated. If these LDL-C–lowering agents are found to be
beneficial, EPA therapy could potentially serve as a complementary
approach to reduce residual CV risk even further, though this specific
combination would not have been studied well in terms of incremen-
tal effects on CV events. Importantly, residual CV risk remains high in
patients with LDL-C well controlled by statins, and many of these
patients will likely need to be treated from multiple angles. The grow-
ing body of TG-related evidence suggests that TG-rich lipoproteins
may be a causal factor in such residual risk. Consequently, TG lower-
ing represents a target of great interest to optimize further CV risk
reduction beyond the LDL-C–lowering benefits attained with statin
use. EPA-specific studies suggest that EPA may provide unique CV
benefits through favorable effects on plasma lipid parameters, as well
as on other pleiotropic pathways.

CONCLUSION
A major remaining question is how to achieve CV risk reduction
beyond the benefits realized from effective management of LDL-C.
For patients with persistently high TG levels despite statin therapy,
an agent that improves atherogenic dyslipidemia without raising LDL-
C and provides other potentially pleiotropic benefits may improve CV
outcomes. The addition of EPA to statin therapy may thus provide
additional CV benefit. The REDUCE-IT trial with high-dose EPA is
designed to address this long-standing scientific gap and to provide
physicians with this much-needed information to guide clinical care
of patients at high CV risk.
