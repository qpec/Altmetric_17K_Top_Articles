Cutaneous wound healing is a complex process that aims to re-establish the original struc-
ture of the skin and its functions. Among other disorders, peripheral neuropathies are known
to severely impair wound healing capabilities of the skin, revealing the importance of skin
innervation for proper repair. Here, we report that peripheral glia are crucially involved in this
process. Using a mouse model of wound healing, combined with in vivo fate mapping, we
show that injury activates peripheral glia by promoting de-differentiation, cell-cycle re-entry
and dissemination of the cells into the wound bed. Moreover, injury-activated glia upregulate
the expression of many secreted factors previously associated with wound healing and
promote myofibroblast differentiation by paracrine modulation of TGF-β signalling. Accord-
ingly, depletion of these cells impairs epithelial proliferation and wound closure through
contraction, while their expansion promotes myofibroblast formation. Thus, injury-activated
glia and/or their secretome might have therapeutic potential in human wound healing
disorders.

 T
he skin is the largest organ of the human body and acts as
the primordial barrier of the organism against the outside
environment. It mainly consists of two principle compo-
nents: a stratified epidermis and an underlying layer of supportive
connective tissue, the dermis. In various occasions throughout
life, acute injuries challenge the integrity of this frontline defence.
In most cases, they trigger an immediate emergency response to
establish a sealed environment and prevent blood loss and
infection, but also slower, long-lasting repair mechanisms. The
latter involve various cell types to restore, at least partly, the initial
biological
properties
of
the
injured
site1–3.
Tissue
repair
mechanisms of the skin have been studied for decades and have
highlighted that many key processes, such as, for instance, neo-
vascularisation, are required to support the increased prolifera-
tion of fibroblasts and keratinocytes3,4.
Besides increased blood supply, the healing response includes a
second essential biological aspect: the neural response. Studies
have shown that under normal circumstances hyperinnervation
follows at the location of the injury5. Impairment of the periph-
eral nervous system (PNS), whether traumatic or pathologic,
results in improper tissue repair and failure to heal6. One of the
main functions of innervation has been attributed to axonal
sprouting of neurons and their associated secretome of growth
factors released in the wound bed upon injury5,7,8. However, non-
neuronal cells of the PNS have also been associated with wound
healing. In particular, cells expressing the progenitor marker Sox2
and originating either from nerve terminals around hair follicles
(HFs), from injured peripheral nerves or from distant sites out-
side the regenerating dermis, were shown to be involved in skin
wound healing9. How these cells contribute to the repair process
is not entirely clear.
To specifically address the role of peripheral glia in cutaneous
wound healing we used genetic mouse models allowing the tra-
cing, conditional depletion, and conditional expansion of per-
ipheral nerve cells in an otherwise undisturbed in vivo context.
In this study, we report a novel role of PNS glia during wound
healing of the skin. After a dedifferentiation and expansion
process, injury-activated glia promote wound contraction and
healing. This process is mediated by the secretion of factors
enhancing transforming growth factor (TGF)-β signalling, which
results in increased myofibroblast formation.
Results
Tracing PNS glia in the injured skin. Skin is a densely inner-
vated organ10 with major nerve bundles (NB) visible in both
intact skin and in skin healing from full-thickness excisional
wounds (Fig. 1a). To determine the potential involvement of skin
innervation in wound healing, we first used genetic lineage tra-
cing to study the fate of nerve-derived cells upon skin wounding.
Tamoxifen (TM)-mediated activation of CreERT2 in the intact
skin of Plp-CreERT2; tdTomato mice led to genetic tracing of
peripheral glial cells in NBs of the reticular dermis, nerve term-
inals around HFs, as well as in nerve endings between muscle
fibres11–13. Apart from NBs and a fraction of melanocytic cells in
HFs, the epidermis and the rest of the dermis appeared void of
Plp-CreERT2-recombined cells (Fig. 1b, and Supplementary
Figs. 1a, 2). Upon full-thickness excision wounding, however, we
observed the presence of many Plp-CreERT2-traced (tdTomato+)
single cells within the wound bed (Fig. 1c). In the intact dermis,
expression of Sox10, a marker for the peripheral glial lineage14,
was mostly confined to NBs surrounded by a prominent laminin-
positive perineurium. In contrast, NBs located adjacent to the
wound displayed disrupted perineurial laminin expression and
were associated with many single Sox10-positive (Sox10+) cells
that seemingly disseminated from the disrupted nerves (Fig. 1d)
and made up for the vast majority of Plp-CreERT2-traced nerve-
derived cells (97.4%) (Supplementary Fig. 1b).
To confirm that NBs indeed serve as a source for cells homing
to the wound bed in injured mouse skin, we made use of a
separate Cre line, Dhh-Cre, which efficiently labels the glial
lineage in the PNS15,16. To visualise the glial lineage before and
after skin injury, we employed confocal 3D-imaging techniques
combined with a fructose-based tissue clearing protocol of Dhh-
Cre; tdTomato animal samples17. Using this method, we observed
a network of tdTomato+ NBs in intact skin, while the stroma in-
between the nerve fibres was devoid of labelling. In contrast, the
granulation tissue of wounded skin, already 6 days post injury
(D6), displayed many single cells apparently stemming from the
injured nerves at the wound edge. By day 14 (D14), the entire
granulation tissue was densely populated by Dhh-Cre-traced cells
(Fig. 1e). Similar to the Sox10+ cell population observed in Plp-
CreERT2; tdTomato mice (Fig. 1d), cells traced by Dhh-Cre
appeared to emigrate from NBs upon injury by D6 (Fig. 1f).
Interestingly, the majority of NB-derived cells found in the
wound both on D7 and D14 were not associated with axons, as
shown by double labelling for Sox10 and neurofilament (NF)
staining (Fig. 1g, h). The combined data from separate tracing
methods
show
that
cells
derived
from
peripheral
nerves
disseminate into granulation tissue upon wounding of the skin.
Wounding induces glial de-differentiation and proliferation.
Schwann cells in peripheral nerves possess a remarkable plasticity
and have been described to de-differentiate and re-differentiate
following injury to the nerve18. To clarify the identity of nerve-
associated cells populating skin wounds, we performed several
immunohistological stainings for markers known to be associated
with different Schwann cell states. Based on these experiments,
we identified two classes of NBs located adjacent to or within the
wound, which we term “quiescent” and “activated”, respectively
(Fig. 2a). Quiescent NBs expressed high levels of myelin basic
protein (MBP), a marker of myelinating Schwann cells, and
axonal NF, but showed weak expression of the low-affinity nerve
growth factor receptor (p75) (Fig. 2b, d). In contrast, activated
NBs were often associated with a distorted NB morphology,
displayed increased levels of p75 protein expression, and stained
only weakly for MBP and NF (Fig. 2c, d). These features resemble
the processes of myelin and axon degradation observed in
Wallerian degeneration.
In addition, only activated NBs and cells dissociating from
them were positive for pERK (Fig. 2e) and c-Jun (Fig. 2g)–markers
associated with Schwann cell plasticity and de-differentiation19–
21. Importantly, cells within activated NBs displayed an increased
proliferation rate (quantified as percentage of Ki67+ cells)
compared to quiescent nerves that were mostly composed of
terminally differentiated, non-proliferative cells (Fig. 2e, f). Of
note, 77% of all p75+ cells also expressed c-Jun. 33% of these
double-positive cells were also marked by Ki67, a nearly 10-fold
increase compared to the number of p75+ c-Jun− Ki67 expressing
cells (3.6%) (Fig. 2g, h). These data demonstrate that wounding of
murine skin results in de-differentiation and active proliferation
of a peripheral glial cell population and suggest that this process
allows peripheral glia to dissociate and emigrate from injured
nerves.
Peripheral nerves in the skin have been shown to harbour cells
that upon isolation and in culture exhibit properties of multi-
potent neural crest stem cells (NCSCs), from which peripheral
glia develop during embryonic development22. To assess whether
disseminating injury-activated nerve-derived cells generate NCSC
lineages other than glial in vivo, we followed their fate at later
time points post injury. In addition to Sox10 (which apart from

 glia also marks NCSCs23), over 90% of the disseminated cells
expressed the de-differentiation marker p75 (Supplementary
Fig. 1b, c). Furthermore, 77.8% of the genetically traced cells
transiently lost the glial lineage marker GFAP at D7, which was
however regained through D14. In addition, 77.4 ± 4% of the p75+
cells displayed the activation marker c-Jun, of which 32.0 ± 3.6%
were positive for the proliferation marker Ki67 (Supplementary
Fig. 1d, e).
Because Plp-CreERT2 not only marks peripheral glia, but also
labels a subpopulation of melanocytes within the skin (Supple-
mentary Fig. 2a, b)11,13, we aimed to assess the contribution of
melanocytic cells to regenerating skin tissue. To do so, we
compared wounding experiments in Plp-CreERT2; tdTomato mice
with Tyr-CreERT2; tdTomato animals, in which the melanocytic
lineage can be specifically traced in vivo24,25. Immunolabelling of
wound sections from both mouse strains ruled out the presence of
any Dct+ cells in the granulation tissue and of any traced cells in
Tyr-CreERT2; tdTomato animals, suggesting that the melanocytic
lineage does not contribute to the cell population traced by Plp-
CreERT2 upon injury (Supplementary Fig. 2c, d). Although during
embryonic development, neural crest cells can give rise to
mesenchymal
derivatives,
Plp-CreERT2-traced
cells
did
not
significantly contribute to the formation of myofibroblasts, as
shown by the lack of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) expression
in tdTomato+ cells (Supplementary Fig. 2e). Thus, activated
peripheral glial cells disseminating into the wound bed appear to
be lineage restricted under our experimental settings in vivo and,
in particular, do not significantly contribute to the myofibroblast
pool, a cell population with important function in matrix
deposition and wound contraction26.
Activated glia secrete factors implicated in wound healing. To
address the role of injury-activated glia during wound healing, we
considered the possibility that these cells provide support by
paracrine secretion of factors or microenvironment modulation
of the healing tissue. Such a mode of action is conceivable given
that Schwann cells have been reported to upregulate chemokines
as well as growth factors upon nerve injury in order to modulate
inflammation and axon sprouting, respectively27,28. To identify
glia-derived factors potentially involved in skin wound healing,
we performed RNA sequencing of Dhh-Cre-traced nerve-derived
tdTomato+ cells isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting
(FACS) from uninjured control animals and 7 days post injury
(Fig. 3a).
Of the 1033 genes found to be differentially expressed between
normal and wounded skin, 526 were upregulated and 506
downregulated (Fig. 3b, c). Among the genes downregulated in
nerve-derived cells upon injury, we found several genes regarded
as positive regulators of myelination, such as Egr2 and Pou3f1/
Oct6, as well as myelin genes and other genes—Mbp, Mal, and
Cdh1—previously reported to be repressed in Schwann cells upon
injury and de-differentiation29–31. Further, among the genes
significantly upregulated upon injury were, for instance, Ngfr,
Gap43, Thy1, Igfbp2, Mdk, Pdgfb, Runx2, Cxcr4, which have all
been reported to be upregulated in Schwann cells upon injury in
previous studies28,29,32–34. Consistent with previous reports, we
observed similar regulation of genes implicated in axon growth,
guidance and protection, including the upregulated genes Epha5
and Sema4f, as well the downregulated genes Nfasc, Nrn1, and
Atp1b235. We also found a set of upregulated genes previously
described as important players in Schwann cell-mediated innate
immune response, chemotaxis, and myelin phagocytosis, such as
Lif, Cxcl5, Areg, Megf10, Mmp14, which all followed a similar
regulation pattern in our data set as previously described after
sciatic nerve injury21,27,28.
Because we hypothesised that injury-activated glia could exert
their function through secretion of soluble factors, using
MetaCore analysis from GeneGO, we focused on the predicted
localisation of the gene products that were differentially expressed
between non-wounded and wounded states. Intriguingly, extra-
cellular space and membrane were the predominant localisations
of gene products activated in peripheral nerve-derived cells upon
wounding. Whereas most of the annotated genes from the
downregulated gene list coded for proteins important in cell–cell
contacts and adhesion, products of the upregulated genes tended
to be secreted and associated to the extracellular matrix and
extracellular space (Fig. 3d). In particular, consistent with our
hypothesis of a paracrine function of injury-activated glia, the
upregulated gene fraction showed a 3.5-fold enrichment in
extracellular space/ECM-related genes upon injury—up to 53.4%
(Fig. 3e).
When considering all differentially expressed genes coding for
proteins with extracellular localisation (n = 455), 61.8% of them
were upregulated (n = 281) and 38.2% downregulated (n = 174)
(Fig. 3f). We clustered these 455 genes according to their function
based on previous reports in the literature and annotations given
in GeneCards (www.genecards.org). According to their described
roles, we defined the following categories for upregulated genes:
(1) growth factors and cell signalling, (2) TGF-β signalling, (3)
chemotaxis and inflammation, (4) migration and adhesion, (5)
ECM remodelling, and (6) angiogenesis. Interestingly, many
genes from this list have been implicated before in different
processes important for wound healing and tissue repair (Fig. 3g;
Supplementary Tables 1–6).
Depletion of injury-activated glia impairs wound healing. In
order to assess the role of injury-activated glia in an in vivo
context, we decided to deplete this cell population using genetic
tools. Sox10 is an important survival and maintenance factor for
the Schwann cell lineage during all stages of its differentia-
tion23,36. In the skin, Sox10 is exclusively expressed in the mel-
anocytic lineage (confined to HFs in murine back skin) and the
glial lineage25,37. To deplete nerve-derived cells in skin wounds
and/or interfere with their migration into the wound, we gener-
ated Plp-CreERT2; Sox10lox/lox; tdTomato animals by breeding
Plp-CreERT2; tdTomato mice with mice carrying floxed alleles of
the Sox10 gene to specifically delete Sox10 in the glial linage
(Fig. 4a). Since effective depletion of Sox10 protein upon genetic
ablation of the allele is a relatively slow process in adult mice38,
we allowed 3 weeks post-TM injection before we subjected both
Sox10 conditional knock-out (cKO) and control littermates to
excisional wounding, although early enough to limit potential
effects of peripheral neuropathy which peaks at 40 days post TM
treatment38. Tissue samples were collected for analysis at several
time points as depicted in Fig. 4a. NBs of Sox10 cKO animals
visually appeared similar to those of control animals and axons in
quiescent NBs were preserved as shown by NF staining (Fig. 4b).
To verify depletion of glial cells in the nerves, we quantified Sox10
+ cells within NBs located close to the wound bed and found that
56.8 ± 4.9% of all cells expressed Sox10 in control vs. 12.5 ± 3.2%
in Sox10 cKO mice at D7 (Fig. 4c).
To assess the number of injury-activated, de-differentiated glia
present upon Sox10 cKO, we performed immunofluorescence
analysis and quantification of p75+ and traced tdTomato+ cells in
the wound bed at two different time points. The data show a
similar significant decrease of p75+ and traced cells in Sox10 cKO
animals at both D7 (46.5 ± 4.4 vs. 7.0 ± 1.8 p75+ cells mm−2 and
40.2 ± 5.4 vs. 2.8 ± 0.9 tdTomato+ cells mm−2 in control vs. Sox10
cKO) and D14 after wounding (90.2 ± 12.8 vs. 24.1 ± 5.0
p75+ cells mm−2 and 153.6 ± 28.8 vs. 43.9 ± 3.3 tdTomato+ cells

Fig. 3a, b). Therefore, rather than adopting alternative fates,
peripheral glial cells having lost Sox10 were virtually all
eliminated, in agreement with previous studies36,38 (Supplemen-

 of Sox10 in the glial linage using Plp-CreERT2 is an efficient
method to decrease the number of peripheral nerve-derived cells
in the wound.
To study possible effects caused by genetic depletion of nerve-
derived cells in the wound bed, we performed macroscopic
measurements and morphometric analysis of control and Sox10
cKO wounds. Although the dynamics of wound contraction can
be variable, as previously described39, we found a significant
difference in the mean wound size at D7 (14.2 ± 1.6% vs. 22.2 ±
3.1% of initial size in control vs. Sox10 cKO) as well as at D9 (4.8
± 1.2% vs. 11.1 ± 3.0%) (Fig. 5a, b). Since the most significant
difference in wound contraction was observed at D7, we carried
out morphometric analyses of D7 wound sections to assess
whether other commonly measured wound healing parameters
were changed as well. The principle of measurements and
representative pictures of wounds at this stage are shown (Fig. 5c).
Quantification of the distance of newly formed epidermis
covering the wound revealed a delay in wound closure in Sox10
cKO animals—an average of 84% of the wound was covered by
epidermis in control, while only 66% of the wound was covered in
Sox10 cKO at the same time point (Fig. 5d). Likewise, the area of
hyperproliferative epidermis (HPE) was significantly decreased
(0.282 ± 0.017 vs. 0.220 ± 0.015 mm2) in Sox10 cKO wounds
(Fig. 5e). Importantly, in the absence of activated glia, the wound
width was increased (1.99 ± 0.08 vs. 2.46 ± 0.08 mm), while the
length of wound epithelium remained unchanged in Sox10 cKO
animals compared to controls, suggesting impaired contraction
(Fig. 5f, g). In sum, injury-activated glia in the wound bed is
required for proper healing.
Activated glia are dispensable for angiogenesis and immune
response. Some of the genes upregulated in peripheral nerve cells
upon wounding encode secreted factors, such as Apln, Esm1,
Mdk, and Vcan, which have previously been shown to influence
angiogenesis. Therefore, depletion of injury-activated glia could
affect neovascularisation (Supplementary Tables 1 and 6). How-
ever, when compared to the granulation tissue of control wounds,
genetic depletion of nerve-derived cells in the wound did neither
significantly change the number nor the density of blood vessels
labelled by the endothelial cell marker CD31 (Supplementary
Fig. 4a).
Further, we assessed the role of these cells on immune cell
chemotaxis, as our differential expression profiling revealed
several genes coding for proteins known to be important for
innate immune cell chemotaxis, such as Cxcl5, Cxcl2, Lif, and
Trem2, among others (Supplementary Table 3). However, no
detectable changes in the number of total immune cells marked
by CD45 or of CD206+ macrophages were observed upon
manipulation of the number of nerve-derived cells in the wound
bed (Supplementary Fig. 4b, c).
Similarly, the above-mentioned expression profile analysis
underlined significant changes in the transcription of genes
involved in ECM deposition (Supplementary Table 5). Hence, we
investigated the state of collagen maturation of D14 control and
Sox10 cKO wound sections using Herovici stainings. However, we
could not detect obvious changes in young vs. mature collagen
deposition between control and Sox10 cKO animals with our
experimental settings (Supplementary Fig. 4d).
Glial depletion impairs TGF-β signalling and myofibroblast
formation. In the wound granulation tissue, α-SMA is a marker
for myofibroblasts, which, as previously mentioned, are impor-
tant for wound healing through their role in wound contraction
and extracellular matrix protein (ECM) deposition40. Our
expression profiling analysis showed upregulation of a number of
genes important for TGF-β signal regulation and myofibroblast
formation, such as Inhba, Ltbp2, Mmp2, Bmp1, Loxl2, Plod1, and
Plod2 (Supplementary Table 2). Hence, we looked at the area
occupied by myofibroblasts post injury. Interestingly, the area of
α-SMA expression was significantly reduced in Sox10 cKO
wounds at D7 (20.7 ± 2.7% of the total granulation tissue area)
compared to control (33.6 ± 2.3%) (Fig. 5h, i). To substantiate
these findings, we performed western blot analysis of protein
isolated from tissue of control and Sox10 cKO wounds at D7 and
measured a significant decrease of α-SMA protein levels upon
Sox10 cKO-mediated depletion of injury-activated glia (Fig. 5j
and Supplementary Fig. 5a). Likewise, Sox10 cKO wounds con-
tained significantly reduced amounts of Periostin (Postn), a
multifunctional promoter of wound healing that has been asso-
ciated, among others, with formation of myofibroblasts from
fibroblasts41 (Fig. 5k and Supplementary Fig. 5b).
To investigate whether TGF-β signal activation is indeed
altered in skin wounds upon ablation of the glial population, we
quantified the number of cells with prominent nuclear pSMAD2
localisation—a downstream marker of activated TGF-β/activin
signalling—in the granulation tissue of the wounds. At D7,
depletion of activated glia led to a significant decrease in the
number of pSMAD2+ nuclei in Sox10 cKO vs. control wounds
(11.29 ± 0.8%
vs.
24.1 ± 1.8%
in
Sox10
cKO
vs.
control,
respectively) (Fig. 5l, m). In sum, conditional ablation of Sox10
in peripheral nerves prior to injury is sufficient to prevent
colonisation of the wound tissue by nerve-derived cells and leads
to delayed wound contraction and re-epithelialisation.
Activated glia promote myofibroblast formation in vivo. Loss
of the tumour suppressor gene Pten has previously been shown to
result in proliferation of both myelinating and non-myelinating
Schwann cells42. Hence, Pten inactivation might represent a
genetic tool to expand the number of nerve-derived cells in
wounds. Therefore, we crossed Plp-CreERT2 mice with mice
carrying floxed alleles of the Pten gene. Pten was then depleted
homozygously shortly prior to injury (Fig. 6a). In both quiescent
and activated NBs of control animals, pAKT expression was not
detectable by immunohistochemical methods. However, upon
Plp-CreERT2-mediated recombination, peripheral nerve cells
prominently expressed pAKT, indicating efficient activation of
PI3K/AKT signalling pathway upon Pten deletion (Fig. 6b).
Remarkably, NBs of Pten cKO animals displayed an overt
expansion of nerve-derived cells in the wound (Fig. 6c). Quan-
tification revealed an approximately two-fold increase in the
number of p75+ and lineage-traced cells in the wound bed of Pten
cKO mice (Fig. 6d, e).
Normal wound healing in healthy mice appears to be naturally
optimised and it has been notoriously hard to experimentally
improve this process2,43. Indeed, the increase in the number of
nerve-derived cells in the wound of Pten cKO mice did neither
lead to a significant acceleration of the wound closure D7 (86.3 ±
5.0% covered by epidermis in control vs. 87.2 ± 5.1% in Pten
cKO) nor did it alter the area of HPE (0.250 ± 0.02 vs. 0.278 ±
0.03 mm2), wound width (2.12 ± 0.09 vs. 1.90 ± 0.10 mm) or
length of wound epithelium (1.81 ± 0.06 vs. 1.68 ± 0.08 mm),
measured at the same time point (Fig. 6f–i).

significantly
increased
upon
Pten

myofibroblasts occupying around 47% of the total granulation

TGF-β signalling was reduced upon depletion of injury-activated
glia (Fig. 5l, m), we found that increasing the number of activated
glial cells led to enhanced TGF-β signalling in cells of the

increased number of cells with nuclear staining for pSMAD2
compared to control (22.2 ± 2.9% vs. 14.2 ± 1.2%, respectively)

 myofibroblast differentiation from dermal fibroblasts, we estab-
lished a co-culture system of human fibroblasts (HuFs) and
murine sciatic nerve explants (SN Exp) obtained from Dhh-Cre;
tdTomato animals, as depicted schematically in Fig. 7a. In this
system, cells of murine origin can be distinguished from unla-
belled HuFs by virtue of their tdTomato expression. Intriguingly,
upon dissection and culture alone, glia in peripheral nerves
appear to undergo processes very much resembling those
observed in vivo upon wounding. Indeed, murine tdTomato+
Sox10+ glial cells in the SN Exp—fibroblast co-culture system de-
differentiated through expression of p75 and c-Jun and sponta-
neously emigrated from the nerve explants (Fig. 7b). To assess the
effect of these activated glial cells on myofibroblast differentiation,
and to decipher a potential implication of TGF-β signalling in this
process, we performed α-SMA staining of HuFs cultured with or
without murine SN Exp, in the presence or absence of the TGF-β
signalling inhibitor SB431542 (SB43)44 (Fig. 7c). Of note, co-
culture with SN Exp significantly increased the number of
α-SMA+ HuFs when compared to cultures without peripheral
nerves (16.1 ± 1.2% vs. 22.3 ± 1.8%, respectively) (Fig. 7d).
Moreover, α-SMA expression was higher in close proximity to the
murine tissue as compared to areas in the same culture dish but
further away from the SN Exp, further demonstrating the
α-SMA-inducing effect of nerve-derived cells (Fig. 7e, f).
Importantly, nerve-dependent induction of α-SMA expression in
HuFs was abolished upon TGF-β signalling blockade (Fig. 7d, f).
Thus, activated glial cells induce myofibroblast formation through
paracrine activation of TGF-β signalling.
Discussion
In the present study, we demonstrate a novel role of injury-
activated peripheral glia during wound healing of the skin.
Lineage-specific genetic tracing, visualised among others by tissue
clearing techniques combined with 3D-imaging, revealed that
glial cells upon skin injury de-differentiate to express markers
characteristic for repair Schwann cells formed in response to
nerve injury18,29 and start proliferating. Intriguingly, activated
glia then disseminate from the injured nerves into the granulation
tissue, where they support non-neural tissue repair of the
wounded skin by paracrine signalling. In particular, depletion of
injury-activated glia impaired TGF-β signal activation and the
appearance of myofibroblasts in the skin; in contrast, genetically
induced expansion of injury-activated glia in vivo as well as their
co-culture with fibroblasts promoted TGF-β signalling and,
consequently, myofibroblast formation.
It is known that injury to peripheral nerves is associated with
peripheral glia activation and de-differentiation29. However, the
signalling event triggering this process remains largely elusive.
Although certain extracellular factors including interleukin (IL)-
645 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α46 have been implicated
in Schwann cell activation, culture of dissected peripheral nerves
without addition of these factors was sufficient to enhance p75
and c-Jun expression in glia. Likewise, co-culture with other cell
types was not required to obtain glial activation in dissected
peripheral nerves, speaking against a major involvement of skin
cells, such as keratinocytes, dermal fibroblasts, or immune cells.
Together with the correlation between loss of axonal NF and glial
de-differentiation that we measured in activated NBs of wounded
skin, our data suggest that impaired physical integrity of per-
ipheral nerves might be sufficient to trigger glial activation.
Activated peripheral glia induced by nerve injury have been
reported to acquire a plastic phenotype reminiscent of Schwann
cell precursors found during embryonic development29. Schwann
cell precursors appear to be multipotent and, apart from glia, can
give rise to endoneurial fibroblasts47, melanocytes12, para-
sympathetic neurons48,49, and mesenchymal cells50. Moreover,
after environmental challenge, PNS glia in the adult can also give
rise to melanocytes12, neurons51, and tooth mesenchymal cells50.
Therefore, we had to consider the possibility that activated glia in
the wound bed structurally contribute to scar formation through
differentiation into non-glial lineages. However, lineage tracing
combined with marker expression analyses did not provide sig-
nificant evidence for injury-activated glia adopting alternative
fates. In particular, traced cells neither generated melanocytes nor
myofibroblasts, which are both cell types that can be produced by
neural crest cells, the precursors of Schwann cells during devel-
opment. Instead, in the undisturbed 3D context of the healing
wound, injury-activated glia displayed lineage-restriction in vivo
and continued to express peripheral glial lineage markers even
after prolonged time points after injury. This is reminiscent of
Schwann cell precursors in the Mexican salamander axo-
lotl (Ambystoma mexicanum) that maintain Schwann cell identity
after limb amputation while promoting regeneration52 and of
astroglia in the mammalian CNS that are also activated in
response to injury and contribute to tissue repair, but exclusively
give rise to astrocytes unless genetically manipulated53.
Rather than a direct contribution of activated peripheral glia to
cell types constituting the wound bed, our study demonstrates a
cell non-autonomous effect on these cells during wound healing.
Expression profiling of genetically traced peripheral glial cells
either from intact or wounded skin demonstrated a significant
enrichment for expression of various ligands and gene products
destined to the extracellular space, representing a putative
secretome of Schwann cells upon injury. This secretome includes
gene products reported to affect multiple pathways, such as ECM
remodelling, angiogenesis, chemotaxis of immune cells, or TGF-β
signalling, which are all biological processes well known to

 influence wound healing2. To test whether any of these processes
were significantly impacted by our cell population of interest, we
genetically ablated injury-activated glia by preventing their
expansion into the wound bed using lineage-specific conditional
deletion of the transcription factor Sox10, a factor known to
control neural crest cell survival and glial lineage specification54.
Preventing dissemination of glial cells into the wound bed
delayed wound healing and, notably, interfered with wound
contraction and proper myofibroblast formation, which was
associated with decreased TGF-β signalling in a non-cell auton-

 myofibroblasts, and wound contraction in vivo55,56. Accordingly,
expansion of injury-activated glia in the wound bed, achieved by
genetic ablation of Pten, led to increased paracrine TGF-β sig-
nalling and myofibroblast counts. Furthermore, genetically traced
glia emigrating from dissected peripheral nerves promoted a
fibroblast to myofibroblast transition in a newly established co-
culture system. This effect was fully blocked by addition of a
TGF-β signalling inhibitor, identifying TGF-β signalling as a
mediator of the paracrine effect exerted by injury-activated glia.
However, besides the activin/inhibin ligand Inhba, our study
did not provide evidence for specific TGF-β ligand expression by
injury-activated glia. Rather, it pointed to modulation of ligand
availability through ECM remodelling and TGF-β post transla-
tional modification, likely conferred by factors known to regulate
these processes and present in the glia secretome, such as Lox,
Loxl2, and Plod2 and Bmp1 (references in Supplementary Tables
2 and 5). This is consistent with previous reports indicating that
non-myelinating Schwann cells have the potential to secrete
molecules regulating latent TGF-β activation57. Although many
other factors of the glia secretome characterised in our study have
been functionally associated before with wound healing (see
references in Supplementary Tables 1–6), their contribution to
the paracrine effects by injury-activated glia remains to be elu-
cidated. Notably, the amount of Periostin, a known inducer of
myofibroblast formation and modulator of several other processes
involved in wound healing41, was decreased in the wound bed
upon genetic depletion of injury-activated glia. Given the many
distinct classes of factors present in the glia secretome, it is
conceivable that injury-activated glia take part in processes of
skin wound healing other than promoting myofibroblast forma-
tion. Indeed, loss of injury-activated glia also affected the area of
newly formed, HPE. However, expansion of peripheral glia in the
wound bed did not influence this process, presumably because it
is naturally optimised in murine skin wound healing43. None-
theless, our data speak for multiple effects of injury-activated glia
and point to a therapeutic potential of these cells and/or of their
secretome in human wound healing.
Our work is in line with other recent reports that showed
crucial roles of peripheral nerve-derived cells in tissue regenera-
tion and repair, both in amphibians and mice9,58,59. For instance,
specialised repair glial cells forming after nerve injury were found
to guide axons and restore innervation21,28. Ablation of Sox2-
expressing cells, which are located in nerve terminals in the skin,
peripheral nerves, and dermal papillae in HFs, impaired mouse
skin wound healing and digit regeneration9,59. Likewise, trans-
plantation of Schwann cell precursors isolated from sciatic nerves
elicited a positive effect on digit tip regeneration by promoting
mesenchymal cell proliferation and bone regeneration via secre-
tion of Oncostatin M and PDGF-AA59. Together with our study
showing their influence on TGF-β-mediated myofibroblast for-
mation and skin wound closure, peripheral glia emerge as
important players in tissue regeneration. Possibly, this involves
interaction of activated glia with other stem and progenitor cells
types. In fact, Schwann cell precursors purified from neonatal
sciatic nerve can stimulate self-renewal of skin-derived pre-
cursors59, a mesoderm-derived mesenchymal cell population able
to reconstitute the dermis60,61. It remains to be shown, though,
whether the nerve-derived cell populations reported in the lit-
erature to have regenerative potential represent distinct cell types
or one dynamic cell population eliciting distinct paracrine
responses to injury depending on the type of injury or the organ
affected. Likewise, it will be highly relevant to address whether
injury-activated glia are also implicated in other tissues for which
regeneration was shown to depend on innervation62, including
heart and skeletal muscle63–65.
Methods
Mouse strains. Dhh-Cre: Tg(Dhh-cre)1Mejr15–a transgene consisting of a Cre
coding sequence inserted at the start codon of a Dhh genomic clone (strain of
origin: FVB/N). Plp-CreERT2: Tg(Plp1-cre/ERT2)1Ueli11–a transgene consisting of
the mouse promoter of the Plp gene driving the expression of a TM inducible Cre
recombinase (strain of origin: (C57BL/6 × DBA/2)F1). Ptenlox: Ptentm1Hwu66–a
floxed allele of Pten allowing the suppression of its phosphatase activity upon
Cre-mediated recombination (strain of origin: 129S4/SvJae). Sox10lox:
Sox10tm7.1(Sox10)Weg54–a floxed allele of Sox10 allowing the conditional KO of the
gene upon Cre-mediated recombination (strain of origin: 129P2/OlaHsd). tdTo-
mato: Gt(ROSA)26Sortm14(CAG-tdTomato)Hze67–a tdTomato sequence preceded by a
loxP-flanked STOP cassette targeted to the Rosa locus. This allows Cre reporting
and subsequent lineage tracing by following tdTomato-expressing cells (strain of
origin: (129S6/SvEvTac × C57BL/6NCrl)F1). Tyr-CreERT2: Tg(Tyr-cre/ERT2)
13Bos24–a transgene consisting of 5.5 kb fragment of the Tyr promoter and a 3.6 kb
fragment of the Tyr enhancer driving expression of a TM inducible form of Cre
recombinase.
Experimental mouse lines. For genetic tracing of neural crest-derived population
Plp-CreERT2; tdTomato, Dhh-Cre; tdTomato, and Tyr-CreERT2; tdTomato trans-
genic mouse lines were used. For the ablation of neural crest-derived cell popu-
lation we used Plp-CreERT2; Sox10lox/lox; tdTomato transgenic mice. For the
expansion of neural crest-derived cell population Plp-CreERT2; Ptenlox/lox; tdTo-
mato transgenic mice were used. All animal experiments have been approved by
the veterinary authorities of Canton of Zurich, Switzerland, and were performed in
accordance with Swiss law on the care, welfare, and treatment of animals.
Genotyping. DNA extracted by standard procedures from tissue samples was
analysed by PCR, using gene-specific primers (Supplementary Table 7).
Experimental animals. In our wound healing experiments, we used animals bred
in-house, aged between 2 and 6 months of several combined transgenic lines, with
their skin hair cycle in the late anagen to telogen phases. Due to the various strains
of origin of our transgenes, the genetic background is empirically considered
mixed. Cell population characterisation by immunolabelling was performed on a
cohort mixed gender. Littermates were evenly distributed across control and cKO
experimental groups. All quantifications were performed on tissue samples
obtained from males only. The experimenters were not blinded and were aware of
the genotype of the animals prior to experimentation. No statistical method was
applied to predetermine the same size of experimental groups. Sample sizes were
large enough to measure the effect size. Appropriate animal health status, in
accordance with our animal experimentation protocol, was used for exclusion

 criteria. No randomisation of the animals was used as experimental group
assignment was primarily dependent on the appropriate animal genotype.
Cre-mediated allele recombination. cKO of Sox10 using the Plp-CreERT2 driver
was performed using i.p. injection of a 10 mg ml−1 TM solution in sunflower oil/
EtOH 9:1. Animals were injected daily with 200 µl TM for 5 consecutive days for a
total of 10 mg TM per animal. To obtain efficient depletion of the Sox10-expressing
population in the skin, cKO of Sox10 was performed 3 weeks prior to injury.
Pten cKO was performed using a 3-day treatment of daily i.p. injection of 10
mg ml−1 TM solution. Operative procedure was performed 5 days after the initial
injection.
Excisional wounding of murine skin. Following a protocol approved by the
Zurich cantonal veterinary office, general anaesthesia of the animals was induced
by 5% Isoflurane in 100% O2 and subsequently maintained using 3% Isoflurane.
The back skin was shaved, thoroughly cleaned, and disinfected prior the surgery
using antibacterial soap solution and 75% EtOH solution. Preoperative analgesia
was applied using a subcutaneous injection of Buprenorphine (0.1 mg kg−1). Four
circular full-thickness excisional wounds of 5 mm of diameter were generated on
the lower back skin of each animal, two on each side, 1 cm of the midline of the
animal and roughly 2 cm apart from each other. Post-operative analgesia was
performed by a 5-day treatment of Buprenorphine through the drinking water.
Wounds were allowed to heal without dressing.
Macroscopic wound size measurement. Wound area was determined for each
wound by quantification of wound area based on pictures taken from day 0 to day
14 post surgery. The area at different time points after wounding were then
reported to the original area value at day 0 for each wound.
Histological analysis of murine skin samples. At the day of sample collection,
animals were euthanised using CO2 and skin samples were excised post-mortem,
fixed in a buffered 4% formaldehyde solution at 4 °C, overnight for samples to be
embedded in paraffin. For samples to be embedded in tissue freezing medium or
subjected to clearing 4 h fixation at 4 °C was performed. Paraffin blocks were
processed into sections of 5 µm while cryoblocks were processed into 12 µm sec-
tions. For immunofluorescence, protocols described elsewhere were applied.
Briefly, sections were deparaffinised and subjected to an antigen retrieval step using
citrate buffer (S2369, Dako). Primary antibodies (Supplementary Table 8) were
applied in blocking buffer (2% BSA in PBS and 0.05% Triton X-100) overnight at 4
°C and visualised using secondary antibodies (Supplementary Table 9) in blocking
buffer for 1 h at room temperature. For pERK, c-Jun and pSMAD2 staining TSA
amplification kit was used (ThermoFischer). Hoechst 33342 (14533, Sigma-
Aldrich) usually was used as nuclear counterstain at a 1 µg ml−1 working con-
centration, unless stated otherwise. Haematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) and Herovici-
stained slides were processed according to standard protocols. Immuno-
fluorescence-stained, H&E-stained, and Herovici-stained sections were imaged
using either a DMI 6000B microscope (Leica) or an Axio Scan.Z1 slide scanner
(Zeiss). Image analysis and quantifications were performed using ImageJ 1.49
(National Institutes of Health, USA) and ZEN (Zeiss) imaging software. For
pSMAD2 quantification three high magnification fields (HMF) per wound were
randomly selected within the area positive for α-SMA, percentage of nuclei positive
for pSMAD2 was quantified and averaged.
Morphometric analysis. Morphometric analysis was performed on 5 µm sections
obtained from the middle of D7 wounds and stained with H&E. Measurements of
wound closure, area of HPE (area of epidermis measured from the point outside of
the wound, where it starts to become thicker than normal epithelium), distance
between wound border HFs (contraction assessment), and length of newly formed
wound epithelium (re-epithelialisation) were carried out using ImageJ as explained
in Fig. 5c and as previously described68.
Expression profiling of genetically traced cells. The skin of three non-wounded
control Dhh-Cre; tdTomato animals and the 7-day-old wounds of their three lit-
termates were collected post mortem and pooled in two groups. Subsequently, the
tissue samples were mechanically chopped using a disposable scalpel and further
dissociated to a single cell suspension using 0.25 mg ml−1 Liberase DH Research
Grade (05401054001, Roche) in RPMI 1640 (42401, Life Technologies) for 60 min
at 37 °C with gentle rocking followed by a treatment with 0.55 mg ml−1 Dispase II
(17105, Life Technologies) and 0.2 mg ml−1 DNase I (10104159001, Roche) for 20
min at 37 °C. The cell suspension was then passed through a 40 µm cell strainer
and sorted for tdTomato positivity using FACSAria III (BD Biosciences) laser.
Sorted cells were directly placed into RNA lysis buffer for subsequent RNA iso-
lation using RNeasy Micro Kit (74004, Qiagen). Total RNA obtained from three
control and three wounded skin samples (pools from four wounds) was then
amplified using Ovation Single Cell RNA-Seq Multiplex System (0342-32-NUG,
NuGEN) and subjected to sequencing on Illumina Hiseq 2500 platform at the
Functional Genomics Center Zurich (http://www.fgcz.ch/). Differential gene
expression analysis was performed using a minimum fold change of 1.5 and a False
Discovery Rate inferior to 0.05. Gene ontology network analysis was performed
with MetaCore (Thomson Reuters).
SN Exp co-culture and immunofluorescence. Fibroblasts used in this study were
derived from a human foreskin sample69 after obtaining permission from the
Ethics Commission of the Canton Zurich and after informed consent given by
parents. For nerve explant co-cultures human dermal fibroblasts were seeded in 12-
well plates at 7 × 103 cells cm−2 density and cultured for 24 h in 10% FBS-
supplemented DMEM. After 24 h the media was changed to 1% FBS DMEM and
sciatic nerve fragments were placed in the middle of the well at low media volume
(300 µl/well). Sciatic nerves were isolated from adult Dhh-Cre; tdTomato mice and
processed as previously published70. Briefly, sciatic nerves were dissected under
sterile conditions–nerves were cut in 2–3 mm pieces followed by careful epineur-
ium and perineurium removal using fine forceps and binoculars. These fragments
can be used as explants and passaged. After 4 days of co-culture fresh DMEM/F12
media containing 1% FBS only or combinations of supplements was added for final
concentration of 10 ng ml−1 TGF-β1 (100-21, Peprotech) and 10 µM SB 431542
(301836-41-9, Tocaris). DMSO was used as vehicle control. Fresh supplements
were added to the media every day for 9 days.
For immunofluorescence cells were fixed for 6 min with 4% formaldehyde in
PBS and blocked for 45 min (3% BSA, 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS). Cells were
incubated with primary antibodies (Supplementary Table 8) overnight at 4 °C (1%
BSA in PBS) and for 1 h at room temperature with secondary antibodies
(Supplementary Table 9) and Hoechst 33342 (PBS). For quantification, in each well
cells positive for α-SMA with visible stress fibres were counted in at least four 1
mm2 HMFs using a DMI 6000B microscope (Leica) and Image J software (National
Institutes of Health, USA). Cells were quantified either distally from the explant (at
least 1 mm from the migrating explant cells) or proximally–with migrating cells
present in HMFs.
Protein isolation and western blotting. For wound protein isolation two D7
wounds were pooled for each sample. Wound tissue was transferred into RIPA
buffer (89900, Thermo Scientific) containing Halt™ Phosphatase and Protease
Inhibitor Cocktail (78440, Thermo Scientific) and tissue was homogenised using
tissue homogeniser (Polytron) and subsequently sonicated three times for 10 s
using ultrasonic homogeniser (Bandelin). SDS–PAGE was carried out on 4–20%
Mini-PROTEAN TGX Gels (456-1094, Bio Rad). Primary antibodies (Supple-
mentary Table 8) were applied in Odyssey blocking buffer (927–40000, LI-COR
Biosciences) overnight at 4 °C and secondary antibodies (Supplementary Methods
Table 9) for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were scanned and quantified using
Odyssey imaging system (LI-COR Biosciences). Quantified band intensities were
normalised using β-Actin and plotted on the graph. Full size scans of the blots are
presented in Supplementary Fig. 5.
Statistical analyses. Statistical analysis was performed and graphs created using
Prism 6 software (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). Variation estimates
were not performed or compared for each data sets. Statistical significance between
two groups was calculated using unpaired Student’s t-test for normally distributed
data sets. For wound area measurements in Fig. 5b nonparametric Mann–Whitney
test was used.
Data availability. The data sets generated during and analysed during the current
study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request. RNA
sequencing data have been deposited to the European Nucleotide Archive under
the accession code PRJEB22372.
