Predictive tools for guiding therapy in children with brain tumors are
urgently needed. In this first molecular drug imaging study in children, we
investigated whether bevacizumab can reach tumors in children with
diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) by measuring the tumor uptake of
89Zr-labeled bevacizumab by PET. In addition, we evaluated the safety of
the procedure in children and determined the optimal time for imaging.
Methods: Patients received 89Zr-bevacizumab (0.1 mg/kg; 0.9 MBq/kg)
at least 2 wk after completing radiotherapy. Whole-body PET/CT scans
were obtained 1, 72, and 144 h after injection. All patients underwent
contrast (gadolinium)-enhanced MRI. The biodistribution of 89Zr-bevaci-
zumab was quantified as SUVs. Results: Seven DIPG patients (4 boys;
6–17 y old) were scanned without anesthesia. No adverse events oc-
curred. Five of 7 primary tumors showed focal 89Zr-bevacizumab uptake
(SUVs at 144 h after injection were 1.0–6.7), whereas no significant up-
take was seen in the healthy brain. In 1 patient, multiple metastases all
showed positive PET results. We observed inter- and intratumoral hetero-
geneity of uptake, and 89Zr-bevacizumab uptake was present predom-
inantly (in 4/5 patients) within MRI contrast-enhanced areas, although
89Zr-bevacizumab uptake in these areas was variable. Tumor target-
ing results were quantitatively similar at 72 and 144 h after injection,
but tumor–to–blood-pool SUV ratios increased with time after injec-
tion (P 5 0.045). The mean effective dose per patient was 0.9 mSv/MBq
(SD, 0.3 mSv/MBq). Conclusion: 89Zr-bevacizumab PET studies are
feasible in children with DIPG. The data suggest considerable het-
erogeneity in drug delivery among patients and within DIPG
tumors and a positive, but not 1:1, correlation between MRI con-
trast enhancement and 89Zr-bevacizumab uptake. The optimal
time for scanning is 144 h after injection. Tumor 89Zr-bevacizumab
accumulation assessed by PET scanning may help in the selec-
tion of patients with the greatest chance of benefit from bevacizumab
treatment.

The need for predictors to guide therapy in individual patients
applies to the entire field of pediatric oncology but, in particular,
to malignant brain tumors. One of the most challenging brain
tumors in children is diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG), a
lethal childhood malignancy of the brain stem comprising 10% of
all pediatric central nervous system tumors (1). DIPG tumors are
resistant to all kinds of systemic therapies, including targeted agents,
and hardly any patient survives beyond 2 y from diagnosis (2,3).
One hypothesis for therapy failure is that drugs actually do not reach
the tumors, as in most DIPG tumors at diagnosis MRI shows little or
no gadolinium contrast enhancement, suggesting an intact blood–
brain barrier for large molecules (4). Molecular drug imaging may
help in the investigation of this hypothesis; however, despite a recent
boost in molecular drug imaging in adults, no immuno-PET imaging
studies have yet been performed in children (5).
Recent messenger RNA profiling studies revealed overexpression
of the proangiogenic vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in
DIPG compared with the normal brain and compared with adult
high-grade glioma, a result that makes proangiogenic VEGF a
potential drug target (6,7). The biologic activity of VEGF can be
neutralized by bevacizumab, a recombinant humanized monoclonal
antibody. The potential of bevacizumab in DIPG is being studied
in several trials (clinicaltrials.gov: NCT01182350; Trialregister.nl:
NTR2391), but few trials have been published (8–10). The overall
survival outcome in these DIPG trials was as poor as in patients
receiving standard treatment (8,9), but individual patients with sig-
nificant responses and prolonged survival after bevacizumab treat-
ment have been reported (10,11). Hence, the challenge is to identify
patients who will benefit from bevacizumab treatment.
89Zr-labeled bevacizumab PET imaging may help in assessment
of the inter- and intrapatient heterogeneity of drug biodistribution in
vivo, thereby predicting the presence or absence of a response in
patients subsequently treated with bevacizumab. Studies in both
mice and adult patients confirmed that 89Zr-bevacizumab PET im-
aging was feasible and able to reveal bevacizumab accumulation in
VEGF-positive tumors (7,12–14). In addition, in adult renal cancer
tumors, 89Zr-bevacizumab uptake was correlated with a response to
bevacizumab treatment (13). The results of our preclinical research
with 89Zr-bevacizumab in mice suggested poor bevacizumab uptake
in intracranial tumors; using pontine, striatal, and subcutaneous glioma
mouse models, we found no significant uptake of 89Zr-bevacizumab in
intracranial tumors at any stage of the disease or in the normal
nonneoplastic surrounding brain in any of the tumor models used
(7). In contrast, a high level of accumulation of 89Zr-bevacizumab
was observed in the subcutaneous glioma xenograft. Therefore, poor
bevacizumab distribution in the brain seemed to be a major issue,
but we also observed a significantly lower level of VEGF expression
in intracranial tumors than in the subcutaneous glioma xenograft.

 As a first step in investigating the clinical utility of immuno-
PET in this setting, we performed a pilot study to investigate
whether bevacizumab can reach tumors in children with DIPGs by
measuring the tumor uptake of 89Zr-bevacizumab. In addition, we
assessed the optimal time for PET imaging, evaluated the biodis-
tribution and radiation dosimetry of 89Zr-bevacizumab, and ascer-
tained the safety and tolerability of scanning procedures without
anesthesia.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Population
The study was conducted at VU University Medical Center, Amster-
dam, The Netherlands. DIPG patients who were 4–18 y old and had
completed radiotherapy (the standard DIPG therapy) at least 2 wk earlier
were eligible. Patients with a known hypersensitivity to humanized mono-
clonal antibodies were excluded, as were those previously treated with
bevacizumab or any other anti-VEGF agent. To reduce patient burden,
PET-related blood sampling and the use of anesthetics were not allowed.
The latter was the reason for the minimum age of 4 y, as children younger
than 4 y were not expected to complete a PET scan with no movement
artifacts without the use of anesthesia.
For all subjects, both parents signed a written informed consent form.
In addition, all subjects who were at least 12 y old signed a written
informed consent form. The study (registered as NTR3518 in The
Netherlands National Trial Register) was approved by the Dutch Central
Committee on Research Involving Human Subjects and the Institutional
Review Board of VU University Medical Center and was performed in
accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
To determine the optimal time for scanning (72 or 144 h after
injection), we aimed to include at least 5 patients with visible tumor
uptake of 89Zr-bevacizumab. These postinjection times were based
on previous research in mice and clinical studies in adults with
89Zr-bevacizumab (7,12,14).
89Zr-Bevacizumab Labeling, Infusion, and PET Procedures
The production and purification of 89Zr and its coupling to bevaci-
zumab were performed in accordance with good manufacturing practice
at VU University Medical Center. The labeling process as well as qual-
ity controls were described previously (15–17), and the results were
similar to those described by Bahce et al. (14). The administered dose
of 89Zr-bevacizumab (0.1 mg/kg; 0.9 MBq/kg) was 1% of the therapeu-
tic bevacizumab dose in humans.
Patients were imaged with a whole-body Philips Gemini TF64 PET/
CT scanner (18). Each PET scan was preceded by a low-dose CT
scan with routinely applied settings. The CT scan was followed by a
10-min static PET/CT scan covering the brain and a whole-body PET
scan (4 min per bed position covering the neck to the upper legs and
1 min covering the legs). PET scans were performed at 1, 72, and 144 h
after injection. Patients were clinically observed for 3 h after injection to
check for allergic reactions, and they were instructed to contact the
hospital in case of later adverse events. All patients underwent T1-
weighted pre- and postgadolinium MRI and T2-weighted MRI without
anesthesia (Siemens Sonata 1.5-T MRI scanner) within a 2-wk period
before PET.
Image Analysis
Visual analysis of the PET scans was first performed without
knowledge of the MRI results. Focal uptake exceeding the local
background was considered to be a positive result. Volumes of interest
were generated manually for tumors and metastases with enhanced
tracer uptake and for the blood pool (1.6 mL in the aortic arch), liver,
kidneys, spleen, lungs, and bone (vertebrae). SUVs were calculated as
the decay-corrected activity concentration (kBq/mL) per injected dose
(MBq) per body weight (kg). PET images of the brain were coregistered
with gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted MR images to enable compar-
ison of postcontrast MR images with PET images. T2-weighted MRI
was used to determine whether 89Zr-bevacizumab uptake was present in
the whole tumor or focally. Whole-body dosimetry was performed with
OLINDA software (19). This dosimetry model takes into account an
age-dependent weight factor.
Statistics
Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS version 19 (IBM
SPSS). For correlations between SUVmean ratios and time after injec-
tion, a nonparametric correlation test (Kendall tb) was used.
RESULTS
Population: Safety and Feasibility
We included 7 patients with primary DIPG tumors; 1 patient
had metastatic disease in the spinal cord and subependymal space,
and another had tumor extension in the facial nerve. The baseline
characteristics of the patients are shown in Table 1. The median
age was 8 y (range, 6–17 y), and all patients had been pretreated
with radiotherapy (in combination with gemcitabine for 3 patients
and in combination with temozolomide for 1 patient). No adverse
events were observed after injection of 89Zr-bevacizumab, and all
patients tolerated the scans and related procedures well. The du-
ration of the whole-body PET scans (including the brain) ranged
from 40 to 50 min. All PET and MR images were of good quality
and had no movement artifacts.
89Zr-Bevacizumab Uptake in DIPG
The PET scans of 5 patients showed focally enhanced
89Zr-bevacizumab accumulation in their primary DIPG tumors
(tumor transverse size range on MRI, 25–37 mm), whereas the
PET scans for 2 patients did not show 89Zr-bevacizumab accumu-
lation (tumor transverse size range on MRI, 36–39 mm) (Figs. 1C
and 1E). The results of all tumor PET scans were negative at 1 h
after injection and became positive as of 72 h after injection (Fig.
2A). In none of the patients was 89Zr-bevacizumab uptake present
throughout the entire tumor, as depicted by T2-weighted MRI. For
example, in the T2-weighted image (Fig. 1B), 89Zr-bevacizumab
uptake was concentrated on the lower right side of the tumor, but
the tumor extended into the whole pons. There was no visually
detectable 89Zr-bevacizumab uptake in healthy brain tissue in any
patient.
Tumor uptake of the tracer among patients was heterogeneous,
with tumor SUVs ranging from 1.0 to 5.3 and from 1.0 to 6.7 at
72 and 144 h after injection, respectively (Fig. 2B). Five DIPG
tumors showed focal areas of modest to strong contrast enhance-
ment on gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted MRI (Fig. 1). Core-
gistration of PET/MR images revealed focal 89Zr-bevacizumab
uptake in these contrast-enhanced areas in 4 of 5 DIPG tumors.
For 1 tumor with an area of gadolinium contrast enhancement
(transverse enhancement size, 13 mm), the PET results were neg-
ative (Fig. 1C). In 1 DIPG tumor, the area of 89Zr-bevacizumab
uptake on PET was not in an area of gadolinium contrast enhance-
ment (Fig. 1D). SUVs in gadolinium-positive tumors varied
widely (Table 1).
In 1 DIPG patient, 11 metastases were observed, and the PET
results for all of them were positive (Fig. 3). The 2 largest metas-
tases were in the spinal cord at the C1 level and in the subependy-
mal space (volumes of 2.0 and 1.2 mL, respectively); the SUVmeans
for these metastases were 2.4 and 6.5 at 72 h after injection and 2.5

 and 7.2 at 144 h after injection, respectively. In 1 patient, exten-
sion of the tumor in the facial nerve was seen on T2-weighted
MRI, but there was no visually detectable PET signal.
Optimal Moment of Scanning and Dosimetry
There was no significant difference in the SUVmeans for the
5 tumors with positive PET results at 72 and 144 h after injection
(Fig. 2B). Because blood-pool activity de-
clined
over
time,
tumor–to–blood-pool
SUV ratios were positively correlated with
time after injection (P 5 0.045) (Fig. 2C).
Whole-body PET evaluation revealed that
organ uptake of 89Zr-bevacizumab among
patients was, in contrast to that in tumors,
quite homogeneous; uptake was highest in
the liver and then in the kidneys, spleen,
lungs, and vertebrae (Fig. 4). The mean
effective dose per patient was 0.9 mSv/
MBq (SD, 0.3 mSv/MBq) (Table 2).
DISCUSSION
There is an urgent need to predict the
potential of a drug before therapy in chil-
dren with brain tumors. In this first (to our
knowledge) immuno-PET imaging study of
pediatric oncology patients, we performed
89Zr-bevacizumab PET imaging of children
with DIPG and showed that the procedure is
feasible without the use of anesthetics from
the age of 6 y. We observed inter- and intra-
tumoral heterogeneity of 89Zr-bevacizumab
uptake in 5 of 7 patients with DIPG,
whereas the normal brain showed no uptake
at all. Two of 7 primary tumors showed
high-level but focal uptake, whereas 89Zr-
bevacizumab was not detectable at all in 2
DIPG tumors. The optimal time for scan-
ning was 144 h after injection, as the tumor–
to–blood-pool SUV ratios increased

 significantly over time. Therefore, we suggest the use of a single
PET/CT scan at 144 h after injection in future studies.
The 89Zr-bevacizumab uptake pattern in all tumors was focal;
interestingly, 4 of 5 tumors showed significant 89Zr-bevacizumab
uptake only within MRI contrast-enhanced areas. Gadolinium up-
take in the brain is associated with degradation of the blood–brain
barrier; thus, when gadolinium–DPTA, with an average molecular
weight of 545 kDa, is able to pass the blood–brain barrier, other
large molecules, such as bevacizumab (149 kDa), may be able to
pass as well—although blood–brain barrier permeability is, of
course, dependent on more than molecular weight alone. In addi-
tion, contrast-enhanced “leaky” tumors have been associated with a
higher level of local VEGF expression (20). However, we observed
high variability in the level of 89Zr-bevacizumab uptake in gadoli-
nium-enhanced areas (from intense to absent 89Zr-bevacizumab
uptake), suggesting large differences in local VEGF expression
among DIPG tumors. Moreover, 1 tumor showed 89Zr-bevacizumab
uptake in an area without gadolinium contrast enhancement. Un-
fortunately, we were not able to validate VEGF expression in tissue,

89Zr-bevacizumab in tumor at 1 h after injection, but there was clear
uptake at both 72 and 144 h after injection (arrows). Uptake in liver was
stable and represented vascularization (1 h after injection) and metab-

 as biopsies are not done routinely in DIPG patients. At least the
clear differences in SUVs among gadolinium-enhanced tumors
(reflecting differences in local drug uptake) and the presence of
drug uptake in tumor areas without gadolinium contrast enhance-
ment suggested that MRI alone is insufficient to predict the tumor
accumulation of large molecules such as bevacizumab and that
immuno-PET is of additional value.
We realize that the influence of radiotherapy is important. In our
preclinical study with nonirradiated DIPG mouse models, we
observed poor uptake of 89Zr-bevacizumab in intracranial tumors
(7). In the present study, the fact that the patients had completed
radiotherapy at least 2 wk earlier may have induced a temporary
disruption of the blood–brain barrier as well as increased VEGF
expression via the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (21).
We expected that DIPG patients would be more eligible for bev-
acizumab treatment after radiotherapy and that the effect on
blood–brain barrier integrity would dissipate with increasing time
after radiotherapy. Therefore, ideally, scans should be performed
before, during, and after radiotherapy in each patient to determine
the susceptibility of tumors to bevacizumab over time.
More studies are needed to show the correlation of tumor uptake
of 89Zr-bevacizumab and the response to treatment in DIPG pa-
tients. In adults with renal cell carcinoma, it has been shown that
a high level of baseline 89Zr-bevacizumab uptake in tumors before
treatment is positively associated with time to progression in bev-
acizumab-treated patients (13). A difficulty in performing such a
study with DIPG patients is that current DIPG trials involve multi-
agent therapy regimens. The finding that bevacizumab can reduce
the penetration of other drugs into tumors (22,23) underlines the
need for labeled-drug imaging in this multiagent setting. On the
other hand, in contrast to single-agent settings, multiagent therapy
may confound the association of the imaging biomarker and
outcome—so that clinical validation of this immuno-PET method
as a predictive biomarker of the response to therapy requires larger
datasets. However, because immuno-PET allows for international
application (long physical half-life of 89Zr; relatively simple, cen-
trally or locally performed radiochemistry), we suggest (on the basis
of the data from the present pilot study) the inclusion of this method
in future international DIPG clinical trials. Furthermore, molecular
imaging data from different trials could be included in the recently
established SIOPE DIPG Registry to enable comparison of results.
Whole-body molecular drug imaging can help to predict organ-
related toxicity. These data are particularly important in children
because drugs developed to target overexpressed cancer-specific
signal proteins (such as VEGF) also target tissues in which these
proteins are expressed during children’s development. In the pre-
sent study, the whole-body
89Zr-bevacizumab biodistribution
revealed a relatively high level of organ uptake in the liver and
then in the blood, kidneys, lungs, and bone. These results are
comparable to the results of the 2 89Zr-bevacizumab clinical trials
in adults and correspond to the results of toxicity trials with bev-
acizumab in children; in these trials, hypertension, bleeding, ele-
vation of the aspartate aminotransferase level, and proteinuria were
reported as the main side effects (13,14,24). We observed moderate
bone uptake, but osteonecrosis is a rarely reported symptom in
bevacizumab-treated children (1%). Whether 89Zr-bevacizumab
uptake also correlates with long-term organ or bone toxicity needs
to be addressed in long-term follow-up studies of children treated
with bevacizumab.
The mean effective dose in the present study was slightly higher
than doses of 89Zr-labeled compounds in studies with adults (25);
this finding likely was due to the age-dependent weight factors in
the dosimetry models. In the present study, the 29-mSv radiation
burden of immuno-PET (including 3 low-dose total-body CT scans)
for an average DIPG patient (25 kg) was considerable, although in
future studies the radiation dose will be reduced to 22 mSv because
only 1 PET/CT (low-dose) scan of the brain will be performed.
However, the possible benefits may outweigh the risks, especially
in light of the poor prognosis (2-y survival of ,10%) for patients
with DIPG.
CONCLUSION
In the present study, we used immuno-PET imaging for pediatric
cancer patients. The procedure was found to be safe and feasible
in children without the use of anesthetics, and the optimal time
for scanning was 144 h after injection. Clear differences in 89Zr-
bevacizumab uptake among DIPG tumors were observed, with
2 tumors showing no uptake at all. Interestingly, 4 of 5 tumors
showed significant 89Zr-bevacizumab uptake on PET within MRI

 contrast-enhanced areas. However, we observed high variability in
SUVs in these contrast-enhanced areas, suggesting differences in
local VEGF expression, and we observed positive PET results in a
non–gadolinium-enhanced area in 1 patient. Therefore, MRI alone
seems to be insufficient for predicting drug accumulation in tumors.
The results suggest that the addition of 89Zr-bevacizumab PET
imaging may be helpful in the selection of potential candidates
for bevacizumab treatment of DIPG because this procedure assesses
both target availability and drug accessibility of the tumor.
