Abstract
IMPORTANCE—Septic shock currently refers to a state of acute circulatory failure associated 
with infection. Emerging biological insights and reported variation in epidemiology challenge the 
validity of this definition.
OBJECTIVE—To develop a new definition and clinical criteria for identifying septic shock in 
adults.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS—The Society of Critical Care Medicine and the 
European Society of Intensive Care Medicine convened a task force (19 participants) to revise 
current sepsis/septic shock definitions. Three sets of studies were conducted: (1) a systematic 
review and meta-analysis of observational studies in adults published between January 1, 1992, 
and December 25, 2015, to determine clinical criteria currently reported to identify septic shock 
and inform the Delphi process; (2) a Delphi study among the task force comprising 3 surveys and 
discussions of results from the systematic review, surveys, and cohort studies to achieve consensus 
on a new septic shock definition and clinical criteria; and (3) cohort studies to test variables 
identified by the Delphi process using Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) (2005–2010; n = 28 
150), University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) (2010–2012; n = 1 309 025), and Kaiser 
Permanente Northern California (KPNC) (2009–2013; n = 1 847 165) electronic health record 
(EHR) data sets.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES—Evidence for and agreement on septic shock 
definitions and criteria.
RESULTS—The systematic review identified 44 studies reporting septic shock outcomes (total of 
166 479 patients) from a total of 92 sepsis epidemiology studies reporting different cutoffs and 
combinations for blood pressure (BP), fluid resuscitation, vasopressors, serum lactate level, and 
base deficit to identify septic shock. The septic shock–associated crude mortality was 46.5% 
(95%CI, 42.7%–50.3%), with significant between-study statistical heterogeneity (I2 = 99.5%; τ2 = 
182.5; P < .001). The Delphi process identified hypotension, serum lactate level, and vasopressor 
therapy as variables to test using cohort studies. Based on these 3 variables alone or in 
combination, 6 patient groups were generated. Examination of the SSC database demonstrated that 
the patient group requiring vasopressors to maintain mean BP 65 mmHg or greater and having a 
serum lactate level greater than 2 mmol/L (18 mg/dL) after fluid resuscitation had a significantly 
higher mortality (42.3%[95%CI, 41.2%–43.3%]) in risk-adjusted comparisons with the other 5 
groups derived using either serum lactate level greater than 2 mmol/L alone or combinations of 
hypotension, vasopressors, and serum lactate level 2 mmol/L or lower. These findings were 
validated in the UPMC and KPNC data sets.

 CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE—Based on a consensus process using results from a 
systematic review, surveys, and cohort studies, septic shock is defined as a subset of sepsis in 
which underlying circulatory, cellular, and metabolic abnormalities are associated with a greater 
risk of mortality than sepsis alone. Adult patients with septic shock can be identified using the 
clinical criteria of hypotension requiring vasopressor therapy to maintain mean BP 65 mmHg or 
greater and having a serum lactate level greater than 2 mmol/L after adequate fluid resuscitation.
Consensus definitions, generated in 19911 and revisited in 2001,2 describe septic shock as a 
state of cardiovascular dysfunction associated with infection and unexplained by other 
causes. The increasing availability of large electronic health record (EHR) data sets, 
registries, national case mix programs, trial data sets, and claims databases using 
International Classification of Diseases code shave since generated multiple observational 
studies reporting septic shock epidemiology. However, variable interpretation and 
application of the consensus definitions1,2 have contributed to variable estimates of both 
incidence and outcomes.3–8 It is unclear to what extent these variations represent true 
differences or an artifact attributable to inconsistent use of definitions.8,9 Furthermore, 
emerging insights into sepsis pathophysiology10–13 warrant a review of the current septic 
shock definition and the criteria used to identify it clinically.
Against this background, the Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) and the European 
Society of Intensive Care Med (ESICM) convened an international task force to review 
definitions of sepsis and septic shock in January 2014.To support the task force deliberations 
on redefining septic shock, a series of activities was performed: a systematic review and 
meta-analysis of criteria used in observational studies reporting sepsis epidemiology in 
adults; a Delphi study to achieve consensus; cohort studies using the Surviving Sepsis 
Campaign (SSC) registry; and subsequent testing of the applicability of the new criteria in 
patients with suspected infection from 2 large EHR-derived data sets. The aims of this study 
were to develop an updated septic shock definition and to derive clinical criteria for 
identifying patients with septic shock meeting this updated definition. Specifically, this 
updated definition and these criteria are intended to provide a standard classification to 
facilitate clinical care, future clinical research, and reporting.
Methods
In this article, “definition” refers to a description of septic shock and “clinical criteria” to 
variables used to identify adult patients with septic shock.
Task Force
The SCCM and ESICM each nominated cochairs of the task force and provided unrestricted 
funding support toward the work conducted. The 2 cochairs then selected 17 other task force 
participants based on their scientific expertise in sepsis epidemiology, clinical trials, and 
basic or translational research. Task force participants are listed at the end of the article. The 
task force retained complete autonomy for all decisions. ESICM and SCCM had no role in 
study design, conduct, or analysis but were consulted for peer review and endorsement of the 
manuscript.14

 Systematic Review and Meta-analysis
The aims of the systematic review were to assess the different criteria used to identify adult 
patients with septic shock and whether these criteria were associated with differences in 
reported outcomes. MEDLINE was searched using search terms, MeSH headings, and 
combinations of sepsis, septic shock, and epidemiology and limits of human studies; adults 
19 years or older; English-language publications; and publication dates between January 1, 
1992 (1991 definitions1), and December 25, 2015. For full-text review, only 
noninterventional studies reporting sepsis epidemiology and all-cause mortality were 
included. Randomized clinical trials were excluded, because the additional inclusion and 
exclusion criteria might confound the effect of criteria on mortality (the study objective).8 To 
avoid variability in outcomes related to specific pathogens, specific patient groups, and 
interventional before-and-after studies, studies reporting these populations were also 
excluded. Data were extracted on cohort recruitment period, cohort characteristics, setting, 
criteria used to identify septic shock, and acute mortality. Detailed methods, including 
search strategy, are presented in eMethods 1 and eTable 1 in the Supplement.
Delphi Study
To generate consensus on the septic shock definition and criteria, 3 face-to-face meetings, 3-
round sequential pretested questionnaires, and email discussions among the task force 
participants were conducted. One task force member did not participate in these surveys 
because of lack of content expertise, and 1 did not respond to the first 2 surveys. 
Questionnaires were developed, refined, and administered consisting of single- and multiple-
answer questions, free-text comments, and a 5-point Likert agreement scale. For consensus 
discussions and noting agreement, the 5-point Likert agreement scales were grouped at the 
tails of the scale choices (ie, “strongly disagree” grouped with “disagree”; “strongly agree” 
grouped with “agree”). All outputs from the systematic review, surveys, and the results of 
cohort studies were made available to participants throughout the Delphi study.
In the first round (August 2014), using 26 questions in 4 domains, agreement and opinions 
were explored on (1) components of the new septic shock definition; (2) variables and their 
cutoffs identified by the systematic review; (3) definitions of, and criteria for, hypotension, 
persistent hypotension, adequacy of resuscitation, and resuscitation end points; and (4) 
septic shock severity scoring. In the second round (November 2014), 4 questions were used 
to generate statements for key terms (persistent hypotension, adequacy of resuscitation, and 
septic shock) and to reach agreement on test variables and outcomes for subsequent analysis 
of predictive validity. The objectives of the third round (January 2015) were to establish a 
consensus definition of septic shock and related clinical criteria. In the third survey, the task 
force members were given 4 choices for the septic shock updated criteria ([1] serum lactate 
level alone; [2] hypotension alone; [3] vasopressor-dependent hypotension or serum lactate 
level; [4] vasopressor-dependent hypotension and serum lactate level) and were asked to 
provide their first and second choices. The cumulative first or second choices were used to 
agree on the reported septic shock criteria.
Questionnaire items were accepted if agreement exceeded 65%. Choices for which 
agreement was less than 65% were rediscussed to achieve consensus or were eliminated, as

 appropriate to achieve the project aims. The survey questionnaires are presented in 
eMethods 2 in the Supplement.
Cohort Studies
The institutional review boards of Cooper University Hospital (Camden, New Jersey),15 
University of Piitsburgh Medical Center (UPMC; a network of hospitals in western 
Pennsylvania), and Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC)16 provided ethics 
approvals for research using the SSC and EHR data sets, respectively.
The SSC registry includes data collected from 218 hospitals in 18 countries on 28 150 
patients with suspected infection who, despite adequate fluid resuscitation as judged by the 
collecting sites, still had 2 or more systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria and 1 
or more organ dysfunction criteria (eMethods 3 in the Supplement). The SSC database 
setup, inclusion, and reporting items are described in detail elsewhere.6,17 To select clinical 
criteria for the new septic shock definition, an analysis data set was created that included all 
patients with a serum lactate level measurement or a mean arterial pressure less than 65 
mmHg after fluids, or who received vasopressors.
For external validation, mortality was determined using the same clinical criteria in patients 
with suspected infection (cultures taken, antibiotics commenced) within 2 large EHR 
databases from UPMC (12 hospitals, 2010–2012,n = 1 309 025) and KPNC (20 hospitals, 
2009–2013, n = 1 847 165). Three variables (hypotension, highest serum lactate level, and 
vasopressor therapy as a binary variable [yes/no]) were extracted from these 2 data sets 
during the 24-hour period after infection was suspected. Descriptive analyses, similar to 
those performed on the SSC data set, were then undertaken. Because of constraints on data 
availability, hypotension was considered present if systolic blood pressure was 100 mmHg 
or less for any single measurement taken during the 24-hour period after infection was 
suspected. Serum lactate levels were measured in 9% of infected patients at UPMC and in 
57%of those at KPNC after implementation of a sepsis quality improvement program.
Statistics
Meta-analysis—A random effects meta-analysis of septic shock mortality by study-
specific septic shock criteria and sepsis definitions was performed. Two meta-regression 
models of septic shock mortality were tested with the covariates: sepsis definition, criteria 
for shock, mid–cohort-year of study population, single center or multicenter, and World 
Health Organization member state regions.18 These 2 models (with and without per capita 
intensive care unit beds) were generated to account for international cohorts and countries 
for which per capita intensive care unit bed data were unavailable (See eMethods 1 in the 
Supplement for details).
Cohort Studies—Hospital mortality was used as the primary outcome for derivation and 
descriptive validation analysis. Using the 3 dichotomous variables identified in round 2 of 
the Delphi process, the SSC cohort was divided into 6 groups and the variables tested either 
alone or in combination: (1) hypotension (mean arterial pressure <65 mm Hg) after fluid 
administration; (2) vasopressor therapy; and (3) serum lactate level greater than 2 mmol/L or

 2 mmol/L or less (to convert serum lactate values to mg/dL, divide by 0.111). Hypotension 
was assumed when vasopressor therapy was being administered, generating 6 distinct 
potential septic shock patient groups using the 3 selected variables (eTable 5 in the 
Supplement). Analyses were performed using either the 6 groups or the 3 dichotomous 
variables as the risk factor. Subsequent analyses using the serum lactate level as a categorical 
variable were performed using a χ2 test of trend for mortality.
Currently, there are no gold standard septic shock criteria for predictive validity 
comparisons.8 Thus, these analyses aimed to identify a patient population that has the 
attributes of the newly proposed definition, which includes higher mortality compared with 
other patient populations commonly reported as having septic shock in the literature 
identified by the systematic review. Therefore, the independent relationship between the 3 
potential criterion variables (hypotension, serum lactate level, and vasopressor therapy) 
agreed on the second round of the Delphi process and a future outcome (hospital mortality) 
was tested using 2 generalized estimating equation population-averaged logistic regression 
models with exchangeable correlation structure, where hospital site was the panel variable.
The first model used the potential septic shock groups 1 to 6 derived from these variables 
(eTable 5 in the Supplement), with group 1 as the referent group and adjusted for other 
covariates to assess true mortality difference between these groups. The second model 
assessed the independent association of these 3 potential criterion variables on hospital 
mortality adjusted for other covariates. These models also included an a priori adjustment 
variable for covariates including region (United States and Europe), location where sepsis 
was suspected (emergency department, ward, or critical care unit), antibiotic administration, 
steroid use, organ dysfunction (pulmonary, renal, hepatic, and acutely altered mental state), 
infection source (pneumonia, urinary tract infection, abdominal, meningitis and other), 
hyperthermia (>38.3°C), hypothermia (<36°C), chills with rigor, tachypnea (>20/min), 
leukopenia (<4000 cells/μL), hyperglycemia (plasma glucose level >120 mg/dL [6.7 
mmol/L), platelet count <100 ×103/μL, and coagulopathy.
These models were used to estimate acute hospital mortality odds ratios (ORs) and adjusted 
ORs for mortality per-unit increase in the serum lactate level using continuous natural log–
transformed serum lactate level. The operating characteristics (sensitivity/specificity over 
hospital mortality curves; positive and negative predictive values) of different serum lactate 
cutpoints (2, 3, and 4 mmol/L) were also tested using the logistic regression model. Multiple 
imputations (n = 20) were used to assess the statistical effect of missing serum lactate 
values.
P < .05 (2-sided) was considered statistically significant. All analyses were performed using 
Stata version 13.1 (StataCorp).

 20155–7,19–107 (Figure 1; eTable 2 in the Supplement). Different shock criteria were used for 
systolic blood pressure (<90 mmHg; <100 mmHg; decrease >40 mmHg; or decrease >50% 
of baseline value if hypertensive), mean arterial pressure (<70; <65; <60 mm Hg), serum 
lactate level (>4, >2.5, >2, >1 mmol/L) and base deficit (−5 mmol/L) (Table 1; eTable 2 in 
the Supplement). Temporal relationships between resuscitation status and end points to 
shock diagnosis were seldom reported. The studies differed in the description of 
resuscitation, persistent hypotension, and in their vasopressor definitions when using the 
cardiovascular Sequential [Sepsis-related] Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score 
categories.113 Diverse infection and organ dysfunction codes were also used in the 
International Classification of Diseases–based derivations.63,70,79,90 Variables highlighted in 
Table 1 and in eTable 2 in the Supplement informed the Delphi survey questions.
The random-effects meta-analysis showed significant heterogeneity in septic shock mortality 
(mean mortality, 46.5% [95% CI, 42.7%–50.3%], with a near 4-fold variation from 23.0% to 
81.8%; I2 = 99.5%; τ2 = 182.5; and P < .001) (Figure 2). Statistically significant 
heterogeneity was also observed in random-effects meta-analysis by clinical criteria reported 
for septic shock case definition in studies (Table 2). The meta-regression models described 
could not explain this heterogeneity (eTable 3A and eTable 3B in the Supplement).
Delphi Study
In the first round, informed by the systematic review, 15 task force members (88%) voted to 
include persistent hypotension, vasopressor therapy, and hyperlactatemia in the updated 
criteria. There was no agreement on the lower cutoff for serum lactate level in this round. 
Eleven members (65%) voted that including fluid resuscitation would improve the criteria. 
The task force determined that neither a severity grading for septic shock nor criteria for 
either adequacy of fluid resuscitation or persistent hypotension should be proposed because 
of the nonstandardized use of hemodynamic monitoring, resuscitation protocols, and 
vasopressor dosing in clinical practice. (Other results are reported in eTable 4 in the 
Supplement.)
In Delphi round 2, the task force was provided with a preliminary descriptive analysis from 
the SSC database. With agreement on the description of the septic shock illness concept, 3 
test variables (hypotension after fluid resuscitation, vasopressor therapy, and serum lactate 
level) were agreed on for predictive validity analyses. The “after fluids” field in the SSC 
database was used as a proxy for resuscitation. The need for vasopressors was agreed as a 
proxy for persistent hypotension by 95%of the task force. Twelve members (71%) voted that 
a minimum vasopressor dose should not be proposed in view of the variability in blood 
pressure targets and resuscitation protocols identified by the systematic review, and because 
of variable sedation use. Vasopressor therapy was therefore treated as a binary variable 
within the analysis. To derive an optimal cutoff for serum lactate level, 13 task force 
members (77%) agreed on acute hospital mortality as the outcome variable. The test 
variables could be present either alone or in combinations, thus identifying 6 potential 
groups of patients with septic shock (Table 3; eTable 5 in the Supplement).
Prior to the final round of the Delphi process, all analyses from the SSC data set and the 
EHR data sets were provided. These findings generated the new definition—“septic shock is

 defined as a subset of sepsis in which underlying circulatory, cellular, and metabolic 
abnormalities are associated with a greater risk of mortality than sepsis alone”—and the 
clinical criteria described below.
Cohort Studies
SSC Database—Patients with serum lactate levels greater than 4 mmol/L who did not 
receive fluids as recommended by the SSCguidelines111 (n = 790 [2.8%]) were excluded. 
Patients without any serum lactate values measured were excluded initially for full case 
analysis (n = 4419 [15.7%]) but were reassessed in the missing data analysis. Of the 22 941 
remaining patients, 4101 coded as having severe sepsis were excluded from this analysis, 
generating the analysis set of 18 840 patients who were either hypotensive after fluids or 
required vasopressors or had a serum lactate level measurement (Figure 3 and Table 3). 
Hypotension was reported in 83.1%, serum lactate level greater than 2 mmol/L in 78.1%, 
and receipt of vasopressors in 66.4%. Overall, crude hospital mortality was 34.7%. Cohort 
characteristics by setting are shown in eTable 6 in the Supplement.
Predictive Validity of Potential Septic Shock Groups—Of the 6 groups of potential 
patients with septic shock (Table 3), the most prevalent was group 1 (hypotension + 
vasopressor therapy + serum lactate level >2 mmol/L) (n = 8520); followed by groups 2 (n = 
3985) and 4 (n = 3266). Crude hospital mortality rates in these 3 groups were 42.3%, 30.1%, 
and 25.7%, respectively. Statistically significant increasing trends in crude mortality were 
observed over increasing serum lactate level categories within groups (χ2 test of trend: P < .
001 for groups 1 and 4, P = .04 for group 3). The adjusted OR for hospital mortality using 
group 1 for reference was significantly lower in all other groups (P < .01 for groups 2 to 6), 
suggesting that group 1 represents a distinct subpopulation with a significantly greater risk 
of death (eTable 7 in the Supplement). By a majority (cumulative first choice, 72.2%; second 
choice, 55.6%) (eTable 4 in the Supplement), the task force agreed that group 1 was most 
consistent with the proposed septic shock definition, thus generating the new septic shock 
criteria.
Derivation of Serum Lactate Cutoff Value and Missing Data Analysis—In the 
generalized estimating equation model (shown in eTable 8 in the Supplement), serum lactate 
level was associated with mortality, and the adjusted OR for hospital mortality increased 
linearly with increasing serum lactate level. An increase in serum lactate level from 2 to 10 
mmol/L increased the adjusted OR for hospital mortality from 1.4 (95%CI, 1.35–1.45) to 
3.03 (95%CI, 2.68–3.45) (referent lactate = 1; Figure 4). A serum lactate level greater than 2 
mmol/L was chosen as the preferred cutoff value for the new septic shock criteria, the 
rationale being the trade-off between highest sensitivity (82.5% when using the n = 18 840 
subset, and 74.9%when using patients in groups 1 and 2 combined [n = 12 475]), and the 
decision from the Delphi process to identify the lowest serum lactate level independently 
associated with a greater risk of death (OR of 1.4 at a lactate value of 2 mmol/L) (Table 4; 
eTable 9, eFigure 1, and eFigure 2 in the Supplement).
Predicated on this understanding of the SSC database structure and the regression analyses 
completed (eTable 6, eTable 7, and eTable 8 in the Supplement), we assumed that data were

 missing at random; ie, any difference between observed values and missing values did not 
depend on unobserved data. Complete case analysis was therefore performed, followed by 
multiple imputation analysis to support the missing-at-random assumption.114 The ORs for 
mortality per unit increase in serum lactate level using complete case analysis (n = 18 840) 
and imputed analyses (n = 22 182) were similar (1.09 [95%CI, 1.08–1.10]; P < .001 vs 1.09 
[95%CI, 1.08–1.09]; P < .001, respectively). The imputed and complete case analysis 
probabilities of hospital mortality were also similar (36.4% and 35.5%, respectively).
EHR Data Sets
The UPMC and KPNC EHRs included 148 907 and 321 380 adult patients with suspected 
infection, respectively (eTable 10 in the Supplement). Forty-six percent (n = 5984) of UPMC 
patients and 39% (n = 54 135) of KPNC patients with 1 or more SOFA score points and 
suspected infection fulfilled criteria for 1 of the 6 potential septic shock groups described. 
Patients meeting group 1 criteria (hypotension + vasopressor therapy + serum lactate level 
>2 mmol/L) comprised 5.3% (UPMC) and 14.9% (KPNC) of the EHR population of 
patients with suspected infection and had a mortality of 54%and 35%, respectively. Similar 
to the SSC database, crude mortality rates within each group were higher among those with 
higher serum lactate levels (Table 5).
Discussion
The systematic review illustrated the variability in criteria currently used to identify septic 
shock, whereas the meta-analysis demonstrated the heterogeneity in mortality. Informed by 
this systematic review, a Delphi process was used to reach a consensus definition of septic 
shock and related clinical criteria. Three large data sets were then used to determine the 
predictive validity of these criteria. Septic shock was defined as a subset of sepsis in which 
circulatory, cellular, and metabolic abnormalities are associated with a greater risk of 
mortality than sepsis alone. The clinical criteria representing this definition were the need 
for vasopressor therapy to maintain a MAP of 65 mm Hg or greater and having a serum 
lactate level greater than 2 mmol/L persisting after fluid resuscitation.
The proposed definition and criteria of septic shock differ from prior definitions1,2,111 in 2 
respects: (1) the need for both a serum lactate level and vasopressor-dependent hypotension 
(ie, cardiovascular SOFA score ≥2) instead of either alone and (2) a lower serum lactate level 
cutoff of 2 mmol/L vs 4 mmol/L as currently used in the SSC definitions. In the new septic 
shock definition, an increase in serum lactate level is positioned as a proxy for a cellular 
metabolic abnormality, and as a variable independently associated with acute mortality 
(predictive validity), which is consistent with the published literature.115–118 An elevated 
serum lactate level is not specific for cellular dysfunction in sepsis118,119 but has face 
validity given the lack of a superior yet readily available alternative. This present study 
identifies a lower serum lactate level cutoff as an independent prognostic variable when 
compared with a recent analysis of the entire SSC database. This disparity is explained by 
using a data set of 18 840 patients in the analysis in this study rather than the total 28 150-
patient SSC data set used by Casserly et al.17 From this subpopulation 6 groups were 
identified and analyzed as risk strata within the generalized estimating equation model and

 performance-tested for various serum lactate level cutoffs. The group with a significantly 
greater risk of death was then selected. In contrast, Casserly et al17 reported the independent 
relationship of hypotension and serum lactate levels with mortality in severe sepsis.
The 6 potential septic shock patient groups analyzed in this study also provide an 
explanation for the heterogeneity in septic shock mortality highlighted by the meta-analysis. 
Depending on the group selected, septic shock mortality ranged from 12.8%to 51.2%within 
the SSC data set and from 7.0% to 64.0% in the EHR data sets. The KPNC EHR data set 
corroborated the consistent trends of higher mortality associated with a higher serum lactate 
level, even in a population with a wider range of illness severity captured by more prevalent 
measurement of serum lactate levels.
The key strengths of the present study are in the methodology used to arrive at the new 
definition and clinical criteria for septic shock, a clinical syndrome with a range of signs, 
symptoms, and biochemical abnormalities that are not pathognomonic. Furthermore, the 
supporting studies (systematic review, Delphi process, and analyses of the SSC and EHR 
cohorts) were iterative and concurrent with the consensus process, a significant step forward 
from previous definitions.
This study also has several limitations. First, the systematic review did not formally assess 
study quality and was restricted to MEDLINE publications, adult populations, and 
observational studies reporting epidemiology. Second, only the Delphi-derived variables 
were tested in multiple data sets to generate the proposed septic shock criteria. Other 
variables, including tissue perfusion markers (eg, base deficit, oliguria, acute alteration in 
mentation), blood pressure characteristics (eg, diastolic pressure), resuscitation end points 
(eg, central venous saturation, lactate clearance), and numerous biomarkers reported in the 
literature,17 could potentially improve on the proposed septic shock criteria but were not 
included. However, operationalizing the definition of septic shock with 3 commonly 
measured variables should increase both generalizability and clinical utility. Third, the lack 
of a gold standard diagnostic criteria for septic shock8 precludes comparative assessment of 
these proposed criteria. Fourth, all data sets had missing data that could potentially introduce 
a form of selection bias.120 In the primary data set (SSC database) this issue was addressed 
by demonstrating that full case analysis is an appropriate method (see “Derivation of Serum 
Lactate Cutoff Value and Missing Data Analysis”). Fifth, serum lactate measurements are 
not universally available, especially outside of a critical care setting or in resource-limited 
environments. Although feasibility is a quality indicator for a definition,8 identification of a 
critically ill patient would generally trigger obtaining a serum lactate measurement, both to 
stratify risk and to monitor the response totreatment.17 Sixth, although the proposed new 
definition and clinical criteria for sepsis are arbitrary, these do have predictive validity for 
mortality, alongsidefaceandcontentvalidity.8
This study represents one step in an ongoing iterative process and provides a resourceful 
structure and a predictive validity standard for future investigations in this area. Prospective 
validation of the clinical criteria may improve on the variables and cutoffs proposed herein, 
and identification and validation of novel markers of organ dysfunction and shock may 
replace lactate level.8

 Conclusions
Based on a consensus process using results from a systematic review, surveys, and cohort 
studies, septic shock is defined as a subset of sepsis in which underlying circulatory, cellular, 
and metabolic abnormalities are associated with a greater risk of mortality than sepsis alone. 
Adult patients with septic shock can be identified using the clinical criteria of hypotension 
requiring use of vasopressors to maintain mean blood pressure of 65 mm Hg or greater and 
having a serum lactate level greater than 2 mmol/L persisting after adequate fluid 
resuscitation.

Selection of Surviving Sepsis Campaign Database Cohort
Hypotension was defined as mean arterial pressure less than 65 mm Hg. Vasopressor therapy 
to maintain mean arterial pressure of 65 mm Hg or higher is treated as a binary variable. 
Serum lactate level greater than 2 mmol/L (18 mg/dL) is considered abnormal. The “after 
fluids” field in the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) database was considered equivalent to 
adequate fluid resuscitation. “Before fluids” refers to patients who did not receive fluid 
resuscitation. Serum lactate level greater than 2 mmol/L after fluid resuscitation but without 
hypotension or need for vasopressor therapy (group 4) is defined as “cryptic shock.” Missing 
serum lactate level measurements (n = 4419 [15.7%]) and patients with serum lactate levels 
greater than 4 mmol/L (36 mg/dL) who did not receive fluids as per SSC guidelines (n = 790 
[2.8%]) were excluded from full case analysis. Of the 22 941 patients, 4101 who were coded 
as having severe sepsis were excluded. Thus, the remaining 18 840 patients were categorized 
within septic shock groups 1 to 6.
aPatients with screening serum lactate levels coded as greater than 2 mmol/L (n=3342) were 
included in the missing-data analysis.

Serum Lactate Level Analysis
Adjusted odds ratio for actual serum lactate levels for the entire septic shock cohort (N = 18 
840). The covariates used in the regression model include region (United States and Europe), 
location where sepsis was suspected (emergency department, ward, or critical care unit), 
antibiotic administration, steroid use, organ failures (pulmonary, renal, hepatic, and acutely 
altered mental state), infection source (pneumonia, urinary tract infection, abdominal, 
meningitis, and other), hyperthermia (>38.3°C), hypothermia (<36°C), chills with rigor, 
tachypnea (>20/min), leukopenia (<4000 cells/μL), hyperglycemia (plasma glucose >120 
mg/dL [6.7 mmol/L]), platelet count <100 ×103/μL, and coagulopathy (eMethods 3 in the 
Supplement). The adjusted odds ratio (OR) for the 6 groups presented in eTable 7 in the 
Supplement and the adjusted OR for the individual variables (lactate, vasopressor therapy, 
and fluids) are reported in eTable 8 in the Supplement. To convert serum lactate values to 
mg/dL, divide by 0.111.

aMean arterial pressure less than 65 mm Hg was used to define hypotension. “After fluids” was defined using the field “crystalloids” coded as a binary term within the Surviving Sepsis Campaign database.
bUsing χ2 tests, trends in mortality across serum lactate categories within groups (>2 to ≤3 mmol/L; >3 to ≤4 mmol/L and >4 mmol/L) were assessed.

aGroup 1 refers to patients with hypotension + vasopressors + serum lactate levels greater than 2 mmol/L. Group 2 refers to patients with hypotension + vasopressors + serum lactate levels less than 2 
mmol/L. Group 3 refers to patients with hypotension and serum lactate levels greater than 2 mmol/L. Groups 4 and 5 refer to isolated serum lactate level greater than 2 mmol/L. Counts within a group are 
not mutually exclusive, as those with serum lactate levels greater than 2 mmol/L will include those in the higher serum lactate cutoffs.
