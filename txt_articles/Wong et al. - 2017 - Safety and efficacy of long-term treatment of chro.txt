Key Points
• Median platelet counts
increased to 50 3 109/L or
more by week 2 in patients
with ITP and were maintained
for $2 years.
• Lower platelet counts, more
previous therapies, and/or
splenectomy resulted in
good but somewhat lower
responses to eltrombopag.
In phase 2/3 trials, eltrombopag treatment of 6 months or less in patients with chronic/
persistent immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) increased platelet counts and reduced
bleeding. The open-label EXTEND study evaluated long-term safety and efficacy of
eltrombopag in adults with ITP who had completed a previous eltrombopag study. For
the 302 patients enrolled, median duration of eltrombopag treatment was 2.37 years
(2 days-8.76 years). Median platelet counts increased to 50 3 109/L or more by week 2 and
were sustained throughout the treatment period. Overall, 259 patients (85.8%) achieved a
response (platelet count ‡50 3 109/L at least once in the absence of rescue), and 133 (52%)
of 257 patients achieved a continuous response of 25 weeks or longer. Responses in
patients with platelet counts lower than 15 3 109/L, more previous therapies, and/or
splenectomy were somewhat lower. Thirty-four (34%) of 101 patients receiving
concomitant ITP medication discontinued 1 or more medication. In patients with
assessments, bleeding symptoms (World Health Organization grades 1-4) decreased
from 57% at baseline to 16% at 1 year. Forty-one patients (14%) withdrew because of
adverse events. Hepatobiliary adverse events (n 5 7), cataracts (n 5 4), deep vein thrombosis (n 5 3), cerebral infarction (n 5 2),
headache (n 5 2), and myelofibrosis (n 5 2) occurred in more than 1 patient; the remaining adverse events occurred only once.
Rates of thromboembolic events (6%) and hepatobiliary adverse events (15%) did not increase with treatment duration past
1 year. EXTEND demonstrated that long-term use of eltrombopag was effective in maintaining platelet counts of 50 3 109/L or more and
reducing bleeding in most patients with ITP of more than 6 months’ duration. Important adverse events (eg, thrombosis, hepatobiliary,
and bone marrow fibrosis) were infrequent. (ClinicalTrials.gov:NCT00351468). (Blood. 2017;130(23):2527-2536)
Introduction
Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune disorder charac-
terized by reduced platelet counts and increased bleeding risk.
Although traditionally a disorder of accelerated antibody-mediated
platelet destruction, the pathophysiology of ITP also encompasses
impaired platelet production.1-4 ITP of 12 or more months’ duration is
currently defined as chronic.5 Bleeding symptoms may range from
common, relatively mild events such as petechiae and bruising to much
less common but more serious events such as intracranial hemorrhage.
The severity of thrombocytopenia imperfectly correlates with bleeding
risk; very low platelet counts are permissive but not sufficient to cause
bleeding.6
Eltrombopag is a small-molecule, oral, nonpeptide, thrombopoietin-
receptor-agonist (TPO-RA) widely approved for treatment of patients
with chronic ITP who are older than 1 year, patients with chronic
hepatitisCandthrombocytopeniatoallowinterferon-basedtherapy,and
patients with severe aplastic anemia who have insufficient response to
immunosuppressive therapy.7 Eltrombopag increases platelet produc-
tion by binding to the transmembrane domain of the TPO-R and
activating proliferation of megakaryocytes from bone marrow
progenitors.8,9 In 6-week and 6-month placebo-controlled studies
in patients with previously treated ITP, eltrombopag increased
platelet counts to 50 3 109/L or more in approximately 60% to
80% of patients and reduced bleeding.10-14 Although headache
and nasopharyngitis were the most frequently reported adverse
events (AEs) with use of eltrombopag in ITP, more serious AEs
(SAEs) have occurred such as increased liver enzymes, develop-
ment of cataracts, thrombosis,7 and bone marrow fibrosis, all of
which have sometimes led to discontinuation of treatment.12-15
The other widely approved TPO-RA is romiplostim.16
Because of their unique mechanism of action, which has limited
anticipation of producing curative effects, TPO-RAs are usually
considered for bridging and maintenance therapy, and administered on

 a daily or weekly basis.5 Because of the unremitting nature of ITP in
most patients with chronic disease, treatment with eltrombopag may be
prolonged, extending for not just months but years. Hence, the efficacy
and safety of eltrombopag beyond 6 months needed to be investigated.
EXTEND (Eltrombopag Extended Dosing) was a phase 3, open-
label, long-term extension study of the safety, tolerability, and efficacy
of eltrombopag in patients with ITP of at least 6 to 12 months’ duration
who had completed a previous eltrombopag study. Interim results from
this study showed that treatment with eltrombopag was safe, well-
tolerated, and effective in maintaining platelet counts in the desired
range for most of the 299 patients treated for up to 3 years.17 This final
study report describes up to 8 years of continuous treatment with
eltrombopag.17
Patients and methods
Study design
EXTEND (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00351468) included adults with
ITP who had previously beenenrolled in one of the followingeltrombopag trials:
two 6-week and one 6-month randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
studies (TRA100773A, TRA100773B, and RAISE)12-14 and an open-label,
single-arm study of intermittent dosing (REPEAT).15 All enrolled patients had
completed the treatment and follow-up periods in the prior studies. To qualify for
the prior studies, patients must have had thrombocytopenia for at least 6 months
(chronicITPwaspreviouslydefinedasthrombocytopeniafor 6ormore months),
insufficient response to at least 1 previous ITP treatment, and a platelet count
lower than 30 3 109/L (20 to 50 3 109/L in REPEAT).12-15 Patients with
secondaryITPwereexcluded.Therewasnoplatelet-countcriterionforentryinto
EXTEND. Patients who had experienced an SAE related to eltrombopag in their
previous study were excluded. Medications prohibited during the study included
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, aspirin or aspirin-containing compounds,
salicylates, rosuvastatin, pravastatin, anticoagulants, quinine, and herbal
supplements.
The eltrombopag dose could be adjusted. The starting dose was 50 mg daily
and was titrated to as low as 25 mg daily or less often if platelet counts were too
high, and to as high as 75 mg daily if platelet counts were too low at 50 mg.
The study was conducted in 4 stages.17
1. Stage 1: Dosing was initiated at 50 mg once daily and adjusted to
identify a dose that increased platelet counts to 100 3 109/L or more.
2. Stage 2: Concomitant ITP medications were reduced or eliminated while
maintaining platelet counts of 50 3 109/L or more with eltrombopag.
3. Stage 3: The dose of eltrombopag was adjusted to identify the minimal
dose of eltrombopag necessary to maintain platelet counts of 50 3 109/L
or more in conjunction with the minimal dose of any concomitant ITP
medication.
4. Stage 4: The safety and efficacy of eltrombopag were monitored at
the minimal effective dose (with or without the minimal dose of any
concomitant ITP medication) that maintained platelet counts at
50 3 109/L or more.
Patientswhoreceivedatleast2yearsoftherapyonstudyandhadtransitioned
off study because of the commercial availability of eltrombopag were considered
to have completed EXTEND, whether or not they continued eltrombopag.
Patients who did not achieve platelet counts of 50 3 109/L or more but
experienced benefit from eltrombopag treatment (as determined with their
physicians) were permitted to remain on treatment in the study. Patients were
discontinued if they were significantly nonadherent with the protocol, became
pregnant,orhadanadverseexperiencethatcouldleadtounacceptablerisk.Study
medication was discontinued for any thrombosis unless the investigator, in
consultation with the study sponsor, determined that the benefit of continuing
eltrombopag outweighed the potential risk. Study medication was also
discontinued for specific hepatobiliary laboratory abnormalities (HBLAs)18 or
ocular changes of clinical concern.
The study was approved by the ethics committee at every participating
institution and was conducted according to the recommendations of Good
Clinical Practice and the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients provided written
informed consent to participate in the study.
Endpoints and assessments
The primary endpoints were safety and tolerability parameters, including clinical
laboratory tests (hematology, coagulation assays, urine dipstick, and clinical
chemistry including liver enzyme assessments), ocular examinations (slit lamp
examination, visual acuity test, and general ophthalmoscopic examination), and
frequency of all AEs. AEs, including hepatobiliary AEs, were assessed with the
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.19
Prespecified secondary endpoints included the proportion of patients
achieving platelet count thresholds ($50 3 109/L and $30 3 109/L)
during treatment, maximum continuous duration of platelet count
elevation of 50 3 109/L or more or 30 3 109/L or more during treatment;
reduction or sparing of concomitant ITP therapies while maintaining a
platelet count of 50 3 109/L or more; proportion of patients achieving stable
platelet counts of 50 3 109/L or more while remaining free of concomitant
ITP medication during treatment; proportion of patients needing rescue
treatment (defined as a composite of new ITP medication, increased dose of
a concomitant ITP medication, platelet transfusion, or splenectomy); and
incidence and severity of signs and symptoms associated with ITP measured
using the World Health Organization (WHO) bleeding scale20 and ITP
bleeding score.21
Platelet counts and safety assessments were performed weekly during the
first4weeksofeltrombopagtreatmentorafteranychangeindoseofeltrombopag
or concomitant ITP medications. In patients receiving a stable dose of
eltrombopag for 4 or more weeks, platelet counts and safety assessments
were performed every 4 weeks.
Safety events of special interest were cataracts, HBLAs (assessed according
to the US Food and Drug Administration guidance for potential drug-induced
liver injury18), thromboembolic events (TEEs), and bone marrow (BM) fibrosis.
Secondary,post-hocanalysesoftime-to-eventforTEEandHBLAwereassessed
using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Cataracts were reported as an SAE. After the
study started, BM examinations were performed annually or when clinically
indicated.22 Analysis was primarily descriptive.
Results
EXTEND began in June 2006 and ended in July 2015. The median
time from ITP diagnosis to entry into EXTEND was 58.8 (range,
9-552) months. Before entering EXTEND, 290 (96%) patients
had a duration of ITP of more than 12 months. At baseline, 33% of
patients were using concomitant ITP medications, 53% had
received 3 or more prior ITP treatments, 38% had previously
undergone splenectomy, and 70% had a baseline platelet count
lower than 30 3 109/L (Table 1). The most common prior ITP
medications were corticosteroids (81%), intravenous immuno-
globulin (46%), and rituximab (23%).
Of 302 patients enrolled, 135 (45%) completed the study and
167 (55%) withdrew; 60% of patients were treated for at least 2 years,
and 35% for at least 3 years (supplemental Table 1, available on the
Blood Web site). The main reasons for withdrawal were AEs (41
[14%]), patient decision (39 [13%]), lack of efficacy (32 [11%]), and
other (39 [13%]; supplemental Table 2). The most frequent on-therapy
AEs leading to withdrawal were hepatobiliary AEs (16 events in
7 patients), cataracts (4 events in 4 patients), and deep vein thrombosis
(3 events in 3 patients). Cerebral infarction, headache, and myelofi-
brosis occurred in 2 patients each. The remaining AEs leading to
withdrawal occurred only once.

 Efficacy
Platelet counts.
Overall, 259 (86%) of 302 patients achieved a
platelet count of at least 50 3 109/L, and 276 (91%) of 302 patients
achieved a platelet count of at least 30 3 109/L at least once in the
absence of rescue therapy. Response rates of at least 1 platelet count
higher than 50 3 109/L were slightly lower in patients with lower
baseline platelet counts (,30 3 109/L, 81.5% [172/211]; 30-50 3
109/L, 98.1% [51/52]; .50 3 109/L, 92.3% [36/39]), those with
splenectomy (80% [92/115] of splenectomized patients vs 89.3% [167/
187]ofnonsplenectomizedpatients),andthosewhohad4ormoreprior
ITPmedications(79.6%[90/113]vs90.5%[171/189]ofthosewith1to
3 prior therapies). Of patients who achieved a platelet count of 50 3
109/L or more in their initial eltrombopag study, 92% to 96% achieved
this level of response again in EXTEND.
Median platelet counts increased to 50 3 109/L or more by week 2
and remained at least 50 3 109/L throughout 250 weeks of treatment
(Figure 1A). More than half of patients achieving a count higher
than 50 3 109/L (133/257; 52%) had a continuous platelet count
of 50 3 109/L or more or twice baseline for at least 25 weeks in the
absence of rescue therapy, and 183 (71%) of 257 patients achieved a
continuous platelet count of at least 30 3 109/L in the absence of
rescue therapy (Figure 1B) during the same period. A platelet count
of 50 3 109/L or more for at least 50% of on-treatment assessments
(continuous or intermittent) was achieved by 185/302 patients
(61%), with lower rates achieved in patients with splenectomy (59/
115; 51%) vs without splenectomy (126/187; 67%), and in those
receiving concomitant ITP medications at baseline (55/101; 54%) vs
no ITP medications at baseline (130/201; 65%). A platelet count of at
least 50 3 109/L for at least 75% of on-treatment assessments was
achieved by 126 (42%) of 302 patients, with lower rates achieved in
patients with splenectomy (36/115; 31%) vs without splenectomy (90/
187; 48%), and in those receiving concomitant ITP medications at
baseline (40/101; 40%) vs no ITP medications at baseline (86/201;
43%). Rates of response at various platelet cutoffs are shown in
supplemental Table 3.
Of 101 patients receiving concomitant ITP treatment at baseline,
34 (34%) of 101 permanently stopped 1 or more concomitant ITP
medication. In addition, 39% (39/101) reduced or permanently
stopped at least 1 ITP medication without ever receiving rescue
therapy, and 37 (95%) of the 39 patients had a sustained reduction
of at least 24 weeks. The most frequently discontinued or reduced
ITP medications were corticosteroids (11% [34/302]), danazol
(2% [5/302]), and azathioprine (1% [4/302]). Medications taken
at baseline and at the end of treatment are shown in Table 2.
Of 302 patients on study, 103 (34%) received 1 or more rescue
treatments: 82 (27%) started a new ITP medication, 27 (9%) increased
their dose of ITP medication from baseline, 21 (7%) received a platelet
transfusion, and 3 (,1%) underwent a splenectomy on study.
Bleeding.
Bleeding symptoms occurred in 171 (57%) of
302 patients at baseline and decreased to 16% (13/80 patients) at
1 year; 50 patients (17%) reported WHO grade 2 to 4 bleeding at
baseline. During the study, rates of bleeding declined in both
splenectomized and nonsplenectomized patients; the great majority
weregrade1or2(Figure2).Nineteenpatientsreportedgrade3bleeding,
and 1 patient reported grade 4 bleeding. The incidence of WHO grade
3 or 4 bleeding was 4.01/100 patient-years. On the ITP bleeding scale,
most patients had no bleeding and those with grade 2 other than skin
bleeding were evenly divided among oral bleeding, epistaxis, and
gynecological bleeding (supplemental Table 4).
Dose adjustments
The median duration of eltrombopag exposure was 2.37 years (range,
2 days to 8.76 years). During the study, 285 (94%) of 302 patients
required a change in the dose (including frequency) of eltrombopag. Of
these,252 (83%) of302 patients hadatleast1 dose increase(or frequency
of dosing) and 218 patients (72%) had at least 1 dose decrease (or
frequency of dosing) (supplemental Table 5). A dose interruption
occurred in 166 patients (55%), with 77 (25%) interrupting dosing once
and 36 (12%) interrupting dosing at least 5 times. Only 15 patients (5%)
required no dose modifications and received eltrombopag 50 mg during
theentirestudyperiod.Amongpatientswithdoseadjustments,48%hada
combination of eltrombopag dose increases, decreases, and interruptions
basedonplateletfluctuations;18%hadbothincreasesanddecreases,23%
had increases only, and 11% had only decreases or decreases and dose
interruptions (Figure 3). Most of these were minor changes; only a very
small number of patients had problematic fluctuations.
At the end of the study, the majority of patients were receiving either
eltrombopag50mgdaily(23%)or75mgdaily(39%);108patients(36%)
used an alternate daily dosing regimen (eg, eltrombopag 25 mg every
other day or less frequently). In 133 patients with a continuous response
for at least 25 weeks, the median dose of eltrombopag was lower (44.4
[range, 1-74.9] mg) than in 168 patients without at least a 25-week
continuous response (63.2 [range, 3.5-74.6] mg; supplemental Table 5).
Safety
Adverse events.
The most frequent AEs were headache, nasophar-
yngitis, and upper respiratory tract infection (Table 3). Most AEs were
grade 1 or 2. Grade 3 and 4 AEs occurred in 78 (26%) and 19 (6%)
patients, respectively. Most grade 3 or 4 events occurred in 1 patient
each, and none occurred in more than 6 patients. Grade 3 events
occurring in at least 3 patients included 6 (2%) patients with pain in
extremity; 5 (2%) each with pneumonia, fatigue, back pain, alanine
aminotransferase (ALT) increase, aspartate aminotransferase (AST)
increase, anemia, or hypertension; 4 (1%) with cataracts; and 3 (1%)
each with diarrhea, headache, migraine, dyspnea, platelet count
decreased, or menorrhagia. Three of the patients included here had

 (6 SAEs), 5 myocardial infarctions (all SAEs), 1 pulmonary embolism
and 1 pulmonary infarction (both SAEs), and 4 cerebral infarction
(3 SAEs; 1 was a nonserious event of left centrum semiovale infarct
[small stroke]; Table 5). This corresponds to an incidence rate of 2.69
TEE/100 patient-years receiving eltrombopag (95% confidence
interval, 1.67-4.11). Of these 19 patients, 9 were splenectomized.
A post-hoc analysis of time-to-first TEE revealed that most events
occurred in the first year and none after year 4 (Figure 4A).
Supplemental Figure 1 shows the relationship between platelet
counts and timing of TEEs in the individual patients.
Hepatobiliary adverse events and laboratory abnormalities.
A post-hoc Kaplan-Meier analysisshowed that the highest incidence of
hepatobiliary events occurred within the first year (Figure 4B). Forty-
fivepatients(15%)hadhepatobiliaryAEs(supplementalTable6),none
of which were grade 4. Grade 3 hepatobiliary AEs included 5 patients
(2%) with increased ALT, 5 (2%) with increased AST, 4 (1%) with
increased bilirubin, 2 (,1%) with increased transaminase, 1 (,1%)
withincreasedbloodalkalinephosphatase,and1(,1%)withincreased
hepatic enzymes. Five patients met criteria for Hy’s law (ALT or AST
.3 3upper limitof normal [ULN] with bilirubin .2 3ULN and ALP
,2 3 ULN); all 5 cases were confounded (see narratives in sup-
plemental Materials). One patient was rechallenged with eltrombopag
after 7 days, and 1 patient continued eltrombopag 75 mg. Of the 37
patients with HBLAs (supplemental Table 6), 24 were considered to
have hepatobiliary AEs.
BM fibrosis.
Centrally22 and locally reviewed BM biopsies
(n 5 356) were obtained from 166 patients treated with eltrombopag for
up to 7 years and were analyzed using the European Consensus Scale
(supplementalTable 7).23In thecombinedcentrallyandlocally reviewed
samples, the majority of patients remained at a marrow fibrosis (MF)
score of 0 (87, 52%) or had a maximal increase to MF-1 (68, 41%). Ten
patients(6%)hada maximal increase to MF-2,and 1(,1%)increased to
MF-3. The 356 on-treatment biopsies were all prompted by study
protocol; none was prompted by abnormal cell counts, morphol-
ogy, or clinical symptoms suggestive of BM dysfunction.22
Deaths
Four patients died while receiving therapy plus 1 day. The causes of
deaths included a traffic accident; bleeding, sepsis syndrome, and
cardiovascular events in a patient with fever on steroids; multiorgan
failure resulting from pulmonary sepsis; and adenocarcinoma. Two
other patients died more than 50 days after treatment. Causes included
hypovolemic shock secondary to gastrointestinal hemorrhage and

 intracranial hemorrhage. None of the 6 deaths was considered related to
eltrombopag treatment.
Discussion
Onthe EXTENDstudy,median plateletlevelsincreasedto503109/L
or more within 2 weeks. Just more than 40% of all patients and 50%
treated for at least 30 weeks achieved a 25-week continuous platelet
count of 50 3 109/L or more, and nearly 70% of patients achieved a
continuous platelet count of 30 3 109/L or more, for at least 25 weeks.
Responses were seen in heavily pretreated patients, splenectomized
patients, more previous therapies, and those with lower platelet counts
at baseline; however, response rates in these groups were lower
than those in nonsplenectomized patients, those receiving 3 or
fewer prior therapies, and those with higher platelet counts at
baseline, respectively. None of the differences between subgroups
was substantial enough to be considered prognostic factors or to
recommend using or withholding eltrombopag in specific patient
subgroups.
WHO grade 3 to 4 bleeding events were infrequent (approximately
4 events/100 patient-years), and TEEs occurred at approximately half
that rate. One third of patients receiving concomitant ITP medications
were able to stop 1 or more concomitant medications without ever
receiving on-treatment rescue therapy, despite many patients having
already reduced these medications in their prior eltrombopag study.
Here, we extend the interim report of the EXTEND study reporting
results inpatientstreatedforupto 3years with eltrombopag,andfurther
explore its long-term safety and efficacy.17 Overall, eltrombopag was
well-tolerated and reasonably safe, with 18 patients being exposed for
6 or more years. Looking at AEs of special interest, TEEs occurred in
6% of patients overall, very similar to results reported with romiplostim
treatment of similar duration24 and in retrospective (6%-8%)25,26 and
prospective (5%) studies of patients with ITP.27 Sarpatwari et al
reported a 4.6% incidence of TEEs in patients without ITP vs 6.1% in
those with ITP.25 Notably, many TEEs occurred in the first year of
treatment, as was found with hepatobiliary events, which occurred at
relatively low rates. Nonetheless, patients should be monitored for
TEEsandHBLA;whentoreducethefrequencyofmonitoring(eg,after
1-3 years) remains to be determined. Rates of cataracts were also low.
Eltrombopag’s contribution to cataract development was difficult to
determine given patients’ multiple confounding risk factors (eg, past
steroid use, age .60 years, and smoking). At this time, screening and
monitoring patients for cataracts before initiating and during
eltrombopag treatment is not routine, but might be appropriate for
patients with 1 or more risk factors.

From 
 BM fibrosis of more than MF-1 was uncommon in EXTEND, with
MF-2 and MF-3 assessment at any time during the study period in
10 and 1 patients, respectively. A prospective longitudinal study of
BM changes during 2 years of eltrombopag found that 5 (3%) of
162 patients had biopsies graded MF-2 or MF-3 at any time during the
study.28 A single-center study reported a similar higher frequency of
MF-2 or MF-3 over time with TPO-RAs.29 The current international
consensus is not to perform routine marrow surveillance in patients
treated with TPO-RAs,30 and to perform them only after loss of platelet
response or when abnormal cells are seen in peripheral blood smears; in
this study, the latter did not occur.5
The goal of managing chronic ITP is to minimize the bleeding risk
by increasing platelet counts to within the hemostatic range,5 with
maximum tolerability and the fewest possible treatment-associated
AEs. Guidelines and expert opinion recommend clinicalintervention in
adult patients with platelet counts lower than 30 3 109/L or lower than
50 3109/L with significant bleeding or risk factors for bleeding or with
fatigue.5,31-34 After initial treatment with corticosteroids or intravenous
immunoglobulin or anti-D immunoglobulin, many patients require
second-line therapy, which in addition to TPO-RAs may also include
immunosuppressants, rituximab, or splenectomy.33,35 As extensively
discussed previously, there is no clear way to decide which second-line
therapy to use in an individual patient.36,37 Randomized studies com-
paring eltrombopag (or romiplostim) with any other treatments are
lacking.
An important premise of using TPO-RAs has been that they
combine a high rate of efficacy with good tolerability and low toxicity
rates. Intravenous immunoglobulin, steroids, and splenectomy have
comparable rates of efficacy (eg, .50% responding).38-41 However,
intravenous immunoglobin is limited by difficulty with intravenous
administration, the postinfusion headaches associated with its use, and
theroller-coastereffectsonplateletcounts.Rituximabandsplenectomy
both have the advantages of long-term and potentially curative
effects.42,43 Rituximab alone has an approximately 20% to 40%
long-term response rate in adults.42-44 Even with 3 cycles of
dexamethasone, the cure rates for rituximab are similar, except in
women with ITP duration of less than 1 year, whose response rates
appear to be higher.45 Splenectomy has a higher curative rate, but
has its own set of toxicities and currently has decreasing
acceptance by patients.46 Therefore, despite the lack of curative
effects and the dietary limitations of eltrombopag, which must be
taken 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal and 4 hours from
supplemental calcium (eg, dairy products),7 use of eltrombopag and
other TPO-RAs are increasing among patients with chronic ITP.
It is worth noting that the dosing of eltrombopag is not straightfor-
ward. Asshown by the number of patients who required doseincreases,
decreases, and interruptions, including those done to reduce concom-
itant medications (eg, reduced steroids), all but 5% required dose
adjustment, and many required increases and decreases in the dose.
Therefore, in addition to regular liver tests to monitor HBLA,
monitoring of blood counts is required at regular intervals even in
patients with apparently stable platelet counts.
The EXTEND study demonstrates that even if eltrombopag is used
for years as maintenance treatment, it may be not only consistently
efficacious but also tolerable and safe in most patients. The American
Society of Hematology convened an expert panel in 2015 to revise the
2011evidence-basedpracticeguidelineforimmunethrombocytopenia,
with publication of new guidelines anticipated in late 2017. Assessing
where TPO-RAs fit within the recommended treatment paradigm will
be hampered by the lack of comparative evidence to other treatments
and uncertainty as to the existence of curative effects.
Limitations include that patients who completed the study were not
followed, so their long-term outcomes are unknown and data on
patients who were able to discontinue therapy were not captured.
In conclusion, in this clinical trial setting, eltrombopag increased
platelet counts in most patients with ITP in a consistent fashion to
adequate levels, was well-tolerated, and appeared safe, with a low

 frequency of SAEs, TEEs, and BM fibrosis. It was effective in
essentially all patient subgroups, although less so in splenectom-
ized and heavily pretreated patients and in those with very low
baseline platelet counts. Good responders maintained platelet
counts of at least 30 to 50 3 109/L for prolonged periods, leading to
lower bleeding rates and reducing the need for concurrent ITP
medications.
