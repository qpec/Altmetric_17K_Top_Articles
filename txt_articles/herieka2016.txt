Abstract 
1 
Background and aims: Because pro-inflammatory stimulants of Toll-like receptor-2 and 
2 
TLR-4 (pathogen-associated molecular patterns, PAMPs), are abundant in some processed 
3 
foods, we explored the effects of diets enriched or depleted in these molecules on markers of 
4 
cardiometabolic risk in man. 
5 
Methods and results: Adherence to a low PAMP diet for 7 days reduced LDL-cholesterol 
6 
(-0.69 mM, P=0.024) and abdominal circumference (-1.6 cm, P=0.001) in 11 habitual 
7 
consumers of high PAMP foodstuffs, and these markers, together with leukocyte counts 
8 
(+14%, P=0.017) increased significantly after 4 days consuming predominantly high PAMP 
9 
foods. Change in LDL-cholesterol and leukocyte counts correlated well with change in 
10 
frequency of intake of high PAMP foodstuffs per individual (r=0.540, P=0.0095 and 
11 
r=0.6551, P=0.0009, respectively). In an independent group of 13 healthy men, leukocyte 
12 
counts and expression of the activation marker CD11b on granulocytes and monocytes were 
13 
significantly reduced after a fresh onion meal (P<0.05), but these effects were reversed by a 
14 
high PAMP equivalent meal. 
15 
Conclusions: A low PAMP diet is associated with reduced levels of several 
16 
cardiometabolic risk factors, while a high PAMP diet reverses these effects. These findings 
17 
suggest a novel potential mechanistic explanation for the observed association between 
18 
processed food consumption and risk of cardiometabolic diseases. The study is registered at 
19 
clinicaltrials.org (reference NCT02430064).

Introduction 
22 
Evidence is accumulating to suggest that chronic metabolic diseases, including type II 
23 
diabetes and atherosclerosis, may be promoted by low-grade inflammation induced by 
24 
specific dietary patterns [1-3]. For example, observational studies have reported that the 
25 
consumption of processed meats, relative to unprocessed meats, is associated with elevated 
26 
C-reactive protein (CRP) levels [4], risk of type II diabetes [4,5] and risk of cardiovascular 
27 
disease [6,7]. However, the specific components of these diets which are responsible for 
28 
promoting inflammatory signalling, or metabolic risk, remain to be clearly defined. 
29 
Recent evidence suggests that conserved molecules of microbial origin termed pathogen-
30 
associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) may play a key role in this relationship [8,9]. In 
31 
particular, parenteral administration of PAMPs which stimulate the innate immune receptors 
32 
Toll-like receptor (TLR)-2 or TLR4 (bacterial lipopeptides, BLP, and lipopolysaccharides, 
33 
LPS, respectively), promotes inflammation, insulin resistance, impaired reverse cholesterol 
34 
transport and atherosclerosis in murine models [8-10]. Circulating endotoxin levels also 
35 
correlate positively with risk of atherosclerosis and type II diabetes in man [11]. 
36 
Because the human large intestine contains a very large number of bacteria (~100 trillion), 
37 
and a high PAMP content [12], it has been widely assumed that food-borne TLR-stimulants 
38 
are unlikely to be significant contributors to systemic inflammatory tone. However, we found 
39 
recently that of the four major phyla that dominate the human intestinal microbiota 
40 
(Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria), only key marker species of 
41 
the numerically minor (~0.1%) Proteobacteria group secreted large quantities of soluble 
42 
stimulants of TLR2 and TLR4 [12]. Accordingly the soluble PAMP content of the human 
43 
faecal microbiota was much lower than expected [12]. 
44 
By comparison, we found that a variety of commonly consumed foodstuffs associated with 
45 
the Western diet, particularly processed foods containing minced meats or chopped onion

stored at refrigeration temperature, frequently contained bacterial TLR-stimulants at 
47 
concentrations that were several orders of magnitude higher than those measured in the 
48 
healthy murine small intestine, which normally has a very low PAMP content but is the major 
49 
site of endotoxin absorption [12-14]. The present study was therefore conducted to explore 
50 
the hypothesis that dietary TLR-stimulants may modify systemic markers of inflammation 
51 
and cardiometabolic risk in human volunteers in vivo.

53 
Materials and methods 
54 
Recruitment and subjects 
55 
Two studies were conducted, one chronic sequential dietary intervention sampling at three 
56 
timepoints over 12 days and one acute, single blinded, cross-over study with 2 interventions 
57 
each sampled on three timepoints over 24 h (see Supplemental Figure 1 for a graphical 
58 
depiction of the study protocols). For the chronic study, 15 healthy male volunteers (age 
59 
37.5±10.0 years) were recruited, of whom 4 reported onset of mild infections during the trial 
60 
and were excluded from further study. For the acute study, 13 healthy male volunteers (age 
61 
27.8±10.7 years) were recruited and all completed the study. Baseline physical characteristics 
62 
of each cohort are summarised in Supplemental Table 1. For both studies, inclusion criteria 
63 
were healthy men between the ages of 18 and 65. Exclusion criteria included evidence of any 
64 
current inflammatory condition, infection or vaccination within two weeks prior to the study 
65 
and use of medications. All subjects gave informed consent, and ethical approval for the 
66 
study (reference NCT02430064 at clinicaltrials.org) was granted by the University of 
67 
Leicester College of Medicine Ethics Committee.

For the chronic study, volunteers were asked to avoid specific types of food we found in 
71 
recent studies to be at relatively high risk of containing high levels of PAMPs [14,15], and to 
72 
consume any quantity of fresh produce, including any form of meat, fish or vegetables that 
73 
had not been minced or processed unless immediately before consumption, for a run-in 
74 
period of 7 days. There were no restrictions on salt, sugar or non-alcoholic beverages. Fasting 
75 
blood samples were collected on days 0 and 7 of this run-in period. Then, over the next 4 
76 
days, subjects consumed a set lunch and evening meal provided to them, each chosen on the 
77 
basis of high PAMP content from prior screens (Figure S2, Table S2). Subjects were asked to 
78 
maintain a quantitative diet diary and to avoid excessive alcohol consumption for the duration 
79 
of the study. A more detailed description of dietary advice, nutrient and PAMP content of 
80 
provided food items, methods for assessing dietary intake and power calculations is provided 
81 
in the Supplemental Methods. 
82 
The acute study was of single-blinded, crossover design. 13 healthy male volunteers fasted 
83 
overnight before giving blood then ingesting either a low PAMP (control) or high PAMP 
84 
onion-based breakfast on separate occasions with at least two weeks washout between visits. 
85 
Subjects provided a postprandial blood sample at 3 h and a second fasted sample at 24 h. The 
86 
low and high PAMP meals differed only in the PAMP content of the onion used to prepare 
87 
each meal, and were otherwise nutritionally identical. Detailed methods for test meal 
88 
preparation and composition, biochemical measurements and nutritional analyses are 
89 
provided in the Supplemental Methods section.

91 
Statistics 
92 
For the chronic study, responses were compared using linear mixed models with Sidak’s 
93 
post-test. For the acute study, linear mixed models were used with meal and time as within 
94 
subject factors. Associations between cytokine production and TLR-stimulant contents of

foods were tested by Spearman correlation. Data were analysed using Graphpad Prism 6 and 
96 
IBM SPSS 22, and are presented as mean ± SE unless otherwise indicated. Statistical 
97

Results 
100 
PAMP content of test meals and diets 
101 
To identify foods at high risk of inducing inflammatory signalling for use in the study, a 
102 
panel of 23 potential test meals purchased from local supermarkets was screened to identify 
103 
inducers of the inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-1β and TNF-α by human whole blood. 
104 
Production of each of these cytokines correlated strongly with food content of soluble TLR4-
105 
stimulants, as measured using HEK-293-TLR4/MD2 transfectants (all r>0.65, P<0.001, 
106 
Figure S2), and also TLR2-stimulants (all r>0.48, P<0.05). As expected, numbers of viable 
107 
aerobic mesophile bacteria increased with time during storage at refrigeration temperature in 
108 
four representative pre-prepared meals (lasagne and bolognese from two suppliers, Figure 
109 
S3). Notably, concentrations of TLR2 and TLR4 stimulants in two of the tested meals were 
110 
already relatively high long before the advertised ‘best before’ date, and while bacterial 
111 
numbers were still low, raising the possibility that the majority of TLR-stimulants in these 
112 
products entered the supply chain prior to assembly and pre-cooking of the ingredients 
113 
(Figure S4). 
114 
Recall questionnaires revealed that the volunteers recruited to the chronic study were 
115 
habitual consumers of foodstuffs identified in earlier studies to be at relatively high risk of 
116 
containing high levels of PAMPs (i.e. processed meats, pre-prepared meals, cheese and 
117 
chocolate, which commonly contain >100 ng/g LPS or BLP [14-16]), consuming on average 
118 
1.4 servings of these items per day. Diet diaries confirmed that the study interventions 
119 
significantly reduced the number of servings of high PAMP foods to 0.5 per day (P=0.002)

7 
 
during the low PAMP run-in week and these increased to 4.8 servings per day during the high 
121 
PAMP arm (P<0.001, Table 1). The meals provided to volunteers during the high PAMP 
122 
period contained on average 73.5 µg Pam3CSK4-equivalent TLR2-stimulants, and 3,109 µg 
123 
E. coli LPS-equivalent TLR4-stimulants per day. Estimated typical daily nutrient intakes 
124 
based on the diet diaries revealed similar levels of consumption of total fat, carbohydrate, 
125 
sugar, fibre, protein and salt, although saturated fat intake was estimated to be ~75% higher 
126 
during the high PAMP arm of the study (Table S3). 
127 
 
128 
Effects of chronic intake of high PAMP meals on systemic markers of inflammation and 
129 
metabolism 
130 
Total leukocyte count was reduced by the low PAMP dietary intervention (-12%, 
131 
P=0.024), but increased significantly from this baseline after 4 days of high PAMP feeding 
132 
(+14%, P=0.017, Figure 1). This was driven by significant increases in numbers of 
133 
granulocytes (+12%, P=0.028) and lymphocytes (+17%, P=0.019). At the individual level, 
134 
there was a strong correlation between achieved change in daily intake of high PAMP foods 
135 
and change in leukocyte counts (r=0.6551, P=0.0009). However, there were no significant 
136 
changes to high sensitivity CRP (Figure 1). Unexpectedly, significant reductions in weight (-
137 
0.7 kg, P=0.028) and abdominal circumference (-1.6 cm, P=0.001) were also recorded after 
138 
the 7 day low PAMP diet (Figure 2). Waist measurements, but not weight, increased 
139 
significantly after the high PAMP intervention (1.2 cm, P=0.025), paralleling a similar fall 
140 
and restoration of serum leptin concentrations. Although the dietary interventions had no 
141 
significant effect on markers of insulin sensitivity (insulin, glucose and HOMA-IR), LDL-C 
142 
was significantly reduced by the low PAMP diet (-0.69 mM, P=0.024) and this was again 
143 
reversed by the high PAMP intervention (Figure 3). Accordingly, at the individual level, 
144 
change in LDL-C correlated well with achieved change in frequency of high PAMP food

consumption (r=0.540, P=0.0095). Blood pressure, serum endotoxin and endotoxin 
146 
neutralisation capacity values, as measured using the limulus assay, were not significantly 
147 
altered by diet (Figure S5). 
148 
 
149 
Acute effects of a single high PAMP meal on systemic markers of inflammation and 
150 
metabolism 
151 
As it was likely that daily intake of saturated fat and food additives, such as surfactants 
152 
and preservatives, differed substantially between the two arms of the chronic study, we could 
153 
not rule out a potential role for these agents in the regulation of inflammatory status from the 
154 
chronic study alone. A second study was therefore designed based on two meals that differed 
155 
in their content of bacterial products, but which were otherwise nutritionally identical. To 
156 
achieve this, we made use of the prior observations that while TLR-stimulants are 
157 
undetectable in freshly chopped onion, γ-proteobacteria (which are a major source of soluble 
158 
TLR2/4-stimulants [15,16]) grow rapidly in chopped onion stored at refrigeration 
159 
temperature [16]. Repeated testing of ready-chopped onion from a particular vendor revealed 
160 
reproducibly high content of PAMPs at the ‘best before’ date. Test meals for the acute study 
161 
were therefore prepared using either 200 g freshly chopped onion (low PAMP meal), or 200 g 
162 
ready-chopped onion (high PAMP meal). TLR-transfectant based bioassays confirmed that 
163 
the two meals differed significantly in their content of TLR2- and TLR4-stimulants (21.0±5.5 
164 
vs 746±324 µg, P=0.0286 and 14.6±5.3 vs 379±153 µg, P=0.0286, respectively). Nutritional 
165 
contents of the complete meals were otherwise identical (Table S4). 
166 
Apart from a significant increase in PBMC CCL-2 mRNA postprandially (38%, P=0.046, 
167 
Figure S6), we did not observe significant increases in inflammatory markers within 24 h 
168 
after the high PAMP onion meal. Unexpectedly, however, the fresh onion meal caused 
169 
significant reductions in several leukocyte markers of inflammatory status. For example, 
170 
 MANUSCRIPT

9 
 
leukocyte counts were significantly reduced 24 h after the low PAMP onion meal (P=0.013, 
171 
Figure S7), and flow cytometry revealed that surface expression of CD11b, which is a 
172 
sensitive marker of leukocyte activation, was significantly reduced on both monocytes and 
173 
granulocytes 3 h after the fresh onion meal (P<0.05, Figure 4). However, these effects were 
174 
not observed after the high PAMP meal. Accordingly, monocyte counts tended to fall after 
175 
the low PAMP meal, but rose after the high PAMP meal (P=0.041 for mealˣtime interaction). 
176 
Neither meal type induced significant changes to hsCRP, the percentage of CD16+CD14lo 
177 
monocytes or PBMC IL-6, TNF-α or IL-1β mRNA. Plasma glucose, insulin, lipids, 
178 
endotoxin, and physical parameters also were not significantly modified by meal type 
179 
(Figures S8-S10, Table S5).

181 
Discussion 
182 
Inflammatory signalling is thought to underpin the development of both atherosclerosis 
183 
and type II diabetes, yet the responsible stimuli remain poorly defined [1]. Dietary factors are 
184 
considered to be plausible candidates, since inflammatory markers are elevated among 
185 
consumers of the Western dietary pattern compared to those consuming predominantly a 
186 
prudent or Mediterranean dietary pattern [2,3]. However, it remains unclear which 
187 
components of these diets modify systemic inflammatory tone [17]. We showed previously 
188 
that many commonly consumed processed foods, but not fresh, unprocessed meats, fruits or 
189 
vegetables, promote inflammatory cytokine production by human monocytes in vitro [14]. 
190 
These effects were found to be dependent on the release of lipopeptides and 
191 
lipopolysaccharides by common food-spoilage bacteria which accumulate in foods containing 
192 
minced meat or finely chopped vegetables when stored at refrigeration temperature for 
193 
extended periods of time [15,16]. To examine the potential relevance of these findings in 
194 
vivo, we here explored the effects of dietary exposure to foods containing high levels of 
195 
 MANUSCRIPT

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
10 
 
lipopeptides and lipopolysaccharides on systemic markers of cardiometabolic risk in healthy 
196 
human volunteers. 
197 
We found that adherence to a high PAMP diet for as little as 4 days caused significant 
198 
increases in total leukocyte, granulocyte and lymphocyte counts. Notably, these markers are 
199 
considered to be not only very sensitive, if non-specific, indicators of low-grade 
200 
inflammation, but also independent risk factors for both type II diabetes and atherosclerosis 
201 
[18,19]. For example, in cohorts similar to those examined here (i.e. healthy young men), a 
202 
white blood cell count (WBC) increment of 1,000 cells/mm3 was associated with a 17.4% 
203 
increase in risk of incident angiographically confirmed CAD, and a 7.6% increase in risk of 
204 
incident type II diabetes over 7.5 years, after adjustment for other risk factors [18,19]. By 
205 
way of comparison, the high PAMP diet increased WBC by 630 cells/mm3. Interestingly, the 
206 
observed changes to WBC count were not paralleled by significant effects of diet on CRP. 
207 
However, these results are consistent with the observation that infusion of very low-dose (0.3 
208 
ng/kg) LPS induces readily detectable increases in leukocyte numbers in human volunteers, 
209 
even when the increase in inflammatory cytokine production is difficult to detect [20]. 
210 
The second major finding from the chronic study was the significant lowering of LDL-C 
211 
by the low PAMP diet, and its rapid reversal by the high PAMP diet. The magnitude of the 
212 
change (18%) is similar to that observed in volunteers randomised to a combined 
213 
Mediterranean diet with plant sterol supplement intervention for 4 weeks [21], but greater 
214 
than reported in trials of individual cholesterol lowering foods, such as psyllium, plant 
215 
sterols/stanols, soy protein or almonds (which typically reduce LDL-C by ~4-13% [22]). 
216 
Interestingly, volunteers were not asked to adopt components of a Mediterranean diet, or to 
217 
increase their consumption of cholesterol lowering foods during the low PAMP arm of the 
218 
study, and indeed no evidence of their adoption was present in the diet diaries. This suggests 
219 
that a PAMP exclusion diet may represent a novel potential means of LDL-C lowering.

Although the mechanisms connecting dietary PAMP intake with LDL-C remain to be 
221 
established, it is interesting to note that in animal models, very low dose (but not high dose) 
222 
endotoxaemia results in a marked increase in VLDL production [23]. We also note that 
223 
although daily intake of saturated fat was considerably higher during the high PAMP week, 
224 
this is unlikely to explain the change in LDL-C, since low saturated fat diets have been 
225 
reported to reduce LDL-C by only ~3% within 6 months [24]. The difference in saturated fat 
226 
intake is also not likely to explain the effects on inflammatory markers, since saturated fatty 
227 
acids were shown not to stimulate TLR2 or TLR4 or otherwise induce classical inflammatory 
228 
signalling cascades in vitro [25]. 
229 
Previous interventional studies have shown that several plant-based foods, such as grapes 
230 
or olive oil, promote systemic anti-inflammatory effects in man [26]. To our knowledge, the 
231 
discovery that fresh onion also induces anti-inflammatory effects in vivo, particularly with 
232 
respect to leukocyte numbers and CD11b expression, has not been reorted previously. 
233 
Nevertheless, these findings are supported by a recent report that onions contain molecules 
234 
(shown to be quercetin and quercetin-4’-O-β-glucoside) which inhibit TLR2- and TLR4-
235 
signalling in vitro [27]. Quercetin was also shown to inhibit LPS-induced CD11b activation 
236 
in human neutrophils in vitro [28]. The notion that processed onions promote inflammation 
237 
may therefore appear counter-intuitive. However, although the bacterial content of fresh 
238 
onion is very low, it has been shown to increase by a factor of ~30 immediately after factory 
239 
slicing [29], and the resulting increase in surface area then allows Gram-negative bacteria to 
240 
reach high levels (~108/g) after a short period of storage at refrigeration temperature [16]. 
241 
If the absorption of PAMPs from dietary sources modifies cardiometabolic risk factors, as 
242 
suggested by the present findings, this offers a novel potential explanation for the observation 
243 
that intake of processed meat (e.g. products containing minced meat) confers an increased 
244 
risk of type II diabetes and cardiovascular disease compared to intake of equivalent quantities 
245 
 MANUSCRIPT

12 
 
of unprocessed meat [4-7]. Indeed, increased processed meat intake was shown to be 
246 
associated with a significant increase in risk of diabetes [4,5], elevated CRP [4] and 
247 
cardiovascular disease [6,7]. By contrast, the Mediterranean dietary pattern is defined in part 
248 
by relatively low intake of pre-packaged ‘ready meals’ and processed meats, and is likely a 
249 
low PAMP diet for these reasons. 
250 
The study has some limitations that should be acknowledged. First, because subjects were 
251 
already habitual consumers of high PAMP foods, the control diet was administered first in 
252 
order to bring inflammatory markers to a uniform basal level before the high PAMP 
253 
intervention. Further studies using randomised order may shed more light on the observed 
254 
effects. Second, the chronic study was not designed to investigate caloric intake or satiety and 
255 
further studies will be required to address the mechanisms of weight change we observed. 
256 
Third, the direct measurement of PAMP absorption from the intestinal lumen to the 
257 
circulation remains very challenging; partly because the half-life of endotoxin, at least as 
258 
detectable by the limulus assay, in the circulation is ~5 minutes [30], and partly because 
259 
TLR2/4-stimulants in plasma are below the limit of detection by HEK-293 transfectants. 
260 
Alternative strategies will therefore need to be developed before the translocation component 
261 
of the hypothesis can be formally addressed. Finally, the cohorts examined here comprised 
262 
healthy, young men, while the pathways examined may be more apparent in subjects with 
263 
impaired intestinal barrier function, such as those with type-II diabetes, non-alcoholic fatty 
264 
liver disease or obesity. 
265 
In conclusion, we present evidence that a low PAMP diet exerts anti-inflammatory effects 
266 
on leukocyte markers of activation and reduces LDL-C, while a high PAMP diet reverses 
267 
these effects. These findings suggest that both the pro- and anti-inflammatory potential of 
268 
foodstuffs may need to be considered in future studies of the effects of dietary constituents on

Figure 1: Effects of chronic dietary PAMP intake on inflammatory markers 
Mean (±SE) leukocyte counts (A) and hsCRP (B) measured in fasted blood samples of 
healthy male volunteers (n=11), at study entry (visit 1), after a low pathogen-associated 
molecular pattern (PAMP) run-in diet for 7 days (visit 2), and after a further 4 days high 
PAMP diet (visit 3). Means were compared using linear mixed models with Sidak’s post-test. 
 
Figure 2: Effects of chronic dietary PAMP intake on regulation of body weight 
Mean (± SE) body weight and abdominal circumference (normalised to baseline, A,B) and 
plasma leptin concentrations (C) measured in healthy male subjects (n=11) at study entry 
(visit 1), after 7 days low pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) diet (visit 2) and 
after 4 days high PAMP diet (visit 3). Means of untransformed (weight, waistline) or log-
transformed (plasma leptin) values were compared using linear mixed models with Sidak’s 
post-test. 
 
Figure 3: Effects of chronic dietary PAMP intake on glucose and lipid metabolism 
Mean (±SE) fasting serum glucose (A), triglycerides (B) and cholesterol (C) measured in
