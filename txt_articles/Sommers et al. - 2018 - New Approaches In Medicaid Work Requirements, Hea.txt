 New Approaches In Medicaid: Work Requirements, Health 
Savings Accounts, And Health Care Access

Abstract
Alternative approaches in Medicaid are proliferating under the Trump administration. Using a 
novel telephone survey, we assessed views on health savings accounts, work requirements, and 
Medicaid expansion. Our sample consisted of 2,739 low-income nonelderly adults in three 
Midwestern states: Ohio, which expanded eligibility for traditional Medicaid; Indiana, which 
expanded Medicaid using health savings accounts called POWER accounts; and Kansas, which 
has not expanded Medicaid. We found that coverage rates in 2017 were significantly higher in the 
two expansion states than in Kansas. However, cost-related barriers were more common in Indiana 
than in Ohio. Among Medicaid beneficiaries eligible for Indiana’s waiver program, 39 percent had 
not heard of POWER accounts, and only 36 percent were making required payments, which means 
that nearly two-thirds were potentially subject to loss of benefits or coverage. In Kansas, 77 
percent of respondents supported expanding Medicaid. With regard to work requirements, 49 
percent of potential Medicaid enrollees in Kansas were already employed, 34 percent were 
disabled, and only 11 percent were not working but would be more likely to look for a job if 
required by Medicaid. These findings suggest that current Medicaid innovations may lead to 
unintended consequences for coverage and access.
The expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) has been associated with 
significant improvements in coverage, access to health care, and quality of care.1–6 But 
much of the debate at the state level since the 2016 election has shifted away from whether 
to expand Medicaid to what alternative approaches to take within the program. This article 
explores several new approaches (implemented or proposed) in Medicaid, using a novel 
survey of three Midwestern states.
The administration of President Donald Trump has prioritized increased flexibility for state 
Medicaid programs. This builds on section 1115 waivers approved during the administration 
of President Barack Obama, including Arkansas’s use of private coverage expansion (the 
“private option”) and Indiana’s consumer-oriented expansion featuring health savings 
accounts.7 Most recently, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) approved

 proposals from Kentucky, Arkansas, and Indiana for the first-ever work requirements in 
Medicaid, and other states such as Ohio have expressed interest in following suit.8
While the private option has been well studied,2,9,10 less is known about the effects of 
Indiana’s expansion. The Healthy Indiana Plan (HIP) was implemented under the leadership 
of Vice President Mike Pence and CMS administrator Seema Verma (then both Indiana state 
officials). Featuring premiums, health savings accounts (called Personal Wellness and 
Responsibility [POWER] accounts), and a lockout period for failure to make required 
payments, the plan’s focus on consumer-oriented provisions has been cited by Trump 
administration officials as a potential exemplar for other states.11,12
Preliminary evaluations of the Healthy Indiana Plan have been mixed, with one contracted 
evaluation concluding that the waiver did not result in significant disenrollment in Indiana or 
act as a barrier to care,13 though independent assessments have criticized that evaluation as 
misleading.14 In contrast, another analysis of the same data found that more than half of 
enrollees lost some benefits because they failed to contribute to their POWER accounts,14 
and qualitative interviews suggested that some enrollees did not understand the accounts.7 
Recently, CMS announced it was scaling back its own evaluation plans,15 which makes the 
need for ongoing independent assessments even more compelling.
Meanwhile, the potential implications of work requirements in Medicaid are of significant 
interest to policy makers.16 Previous analyses indicate that most Medicaid beneficiaries are 
disabled or already working.16,17 However, to our knowledge, no studies have explored how 
many potential enrollees would change their employment behavior (or which demographic 
groups might be most likely to do so) in response to a work requirement.
This study presents survey data collected in late 2017 from low-income adults in three 
Midwestern states with different Medicaid policies: Indiana, which expanded coverage in 
2015 via a section 1115 waiver; Ohio, which expanded Medicaid without a waiver in 2014; 
and Kansas, which has not expanded Medicaid (the governor vetoed an expansion bill in 
early 2017).18 In Kansas, debate over expanding Medicaid continues, and the state is 
considering imposing work requirements for both the expansion and traditional Medicaid 
populations.
The objectives of our study were to assess differences in coverage, access, and heath care 
satisfaction among low-income adults in these states; examine low-income adults’ 
experiences with some of the unique features of the Healthy Indiana Plan; and explore 
attitudes about expansion and the potential effects of Medicaid work requirements in 
Kansas.
Study Data And Methods
KEY STATE POLICIES
Medicaid policies in our three study states are shown in exhibit 1. Ohio had a traditional 
Medicaid expansion without premiums and with minimal cost sharing. Kansas has not 
expanded Medicaid under the ACA. This means that nondisabled childless adults in Kansas

 cannot qualify for Medicaid, and among other adults, only very poor parents (those with 
incomes at or below 38 percent of the federal poverty level) and disabled adults with 
incomes at or below 75 percent of poverty are eligible for Medicaid.
Indiana’s waiver program, HIP 2.0, built upon an earlier smaller waiver program (known 
retrospectively as HIP 1.0) and features two variations of Medicaid coverage, HIP Basic and 
HIP Plus. Eligibility is the same in the two variations, although only HIP Basic entails cost 
sharing in the form of graduated copayments for certain services. HIP Plus provides more 
generous prescription drug coverage than HIP Basic does, as well as other benefits not 
covered by HIP Basic—including vision and dental services. Those who enroll in HIP 2.0 
and make their first payment (which is essentially a premium, though some state materials 
refer to this as a “POWER account contribution”) initially receive benefits provided through 
HIP Plus. It has a $2,500 deductible, coupled with a state- and consumer-funded $2,500 
POWER account (similar to a health savings account) whose funds must be used to pay for 
health care services before the insurance benefit kicks in. Applicants with incomes of 101–
138 percent of poverty who do not make their original POWER account contributions within 
sixty days are never enrolled in the program; those with incomes up to 100 percent of 
poverty who never make a contribution are enrolled in HIP Basic.13
To maintain enrollment in HIP Plus, members are required to continue making monthly 
POWER account contributions equal to 2 percent of their income. Members with incomes 
up to 100 percent of poverty who fail to make payments for three consecutive months are 
moved from HIP Plus to HIP Basic. Members with incomes of 101–138 percent of poverty 
who fail to make payments for three consecutive months are removed from HIP 2.0 and 
“locked out” of Medicaid for six months (individuals deemed “medically frail” cannot be 
locked out of coverage). Any unspent POWER funds are rolled over at year’s end, reducing 
the contribution required in the following year.
STUDY SAMPLE
Our sample consisted of non-elderly adults with family incomes at or below 138 percent of 
poverty, the cutoff for the ACA’s Medicaid expansion. We oversampled in Indiana and 
Kansas, given our intention to ask additional state-specific questions in those states.
SURVEY DESIGN
We contracted with a survey research firm to conduct a random-digit-dialed telephone 
survey of low-income residents in Indiana, Kansas, and Ohio. The survey instrument was 
pretested in a population similar to our sampled respondents and then fielded between 
November 9, 2017, and January 2, 2018. All but eleven surveys (0.4 percent) were 
completed in 2017, and excluding those eleven surveys had minimal effect on our findings. 
Inclusion criteria were being a US citizen ages 19–64 and having a family income at or 
below 138 percent of poverty. The survey was conducted in English or Spanish and via cell 
and landline phones. The response rate was 15 percent overall (12 percent in Indiana, 17 
percent in Kansas, and 14 percent in Ohio), according to response rate 3 (RR3) definition of 
the American Association for Public Opinion Research.

 OUTCOMES
We measured several outcomes in all three states: source of health insurance; having a 
personal doctor; delays in care due to cost in the past twelve months; and needing to borrow 
money, skip paying medical bills, or skip paying other bills due to medical bills in the past 
twelve months (see the online appendix methods for survey questions and additional 
details).19 The survey asked whether respondents felt that they had been hurt or helped by 
the ACA or had experienced no effect and asked them to rate the quality of their health care 
over the past six months on a scale of 0 to 10, a question obtained from a recent Medicaid 
survey conducted by CMS.20
For respondents in Indiana, we asked state-specific questions of two coverage groups. Those 
with Medicaid whose responses indicated that they were eligible for HIP 2.0 (that is, people 
who were neither pregnant nor eligible for Medicaid due to a disability) were asked about 
their knowledge, use, and perception of POWER accounts. We asked currently uninsured 
people in Indiana for their primary reason for not enrolling in HIP 2.0. For respondents in 
Kansas, our state-specific outcomes of interest were whether they supported or opposed 
Medicaid expansion, how they perceived the quality of care with Medicaid compared to 
private insurance or being uninsured, their employment and disability status, and whether 
they would be more likely to look for work as a condition of Medicaid eligibility. Because of 
survey length constraints, we asked about work requirements in Kansas only.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
All responses were weighted to match state-specific population benchmarks in the 2016 
American Community Survey for education, race/ethnicity, marital status, geographic 
region, population density, and cell phone status.
Survey-weighted descriptive statistics were computed for all outcomes. Then, for binary 
outcomes, we used multivariate logistic regression, and for the only continuous measure 
(quality of care), we used multivariate linear regression to identify significant predictors of 
each outcome. These models included the following covariates: state of residence, age, race/
ethnicity, educational attainment, rural versus urban residence, sex, political party affiliation, 
marital status, and family income. Analyses of outcomes assessed within a single state (for 
example, work requirements in Kansas and HIP 2.0 experiences in Indiana) were similar 
except that they did not include the state as a covariate.
All analyses were conducted using Stata, version 15. We used the “margins” command to 
generate predicted probabilities from our regression models for ease of interpretation.
LIMITATIONS
Our study had several limitations. First, the response rate was 15 percent. However, our use 
of population benchmarks for weighting has been shown to reduce the potential nonresponse 
bias in random-digit-dialed surveys.21 Additionally, results in previous research using a 
similar instrument have been validated against two federal government surveys, which 
demonstrated similar overall patterns of coverage and access to care.9 More broadly, our

 response rate compares favorably to those of other surveys that are frequently used to 
evaluate the ACA.22,23
Second, our three-state comparisons relied on cross-sectional state differences, which can be 
biased by numerous unmeasured factors that differ between states despite multivariate 
adjustment. However, our results are quite similar to those of numerous more rigorous quasi-
experimental comparisons between expansion and nonexpansion states for similar outcomes.
1–5
Third, many of our state-specific questions, such as those related to Indiana’s POWER 
accounts, were asked of relatively few people. However, our sample size in Indiana was 
similar to or larger than those of two prior studies of HIP 2.0.7,13
Fourth, we asked respondents in Indiana whether they had heard of or were aware of 
POWER accounts. It is possible that some respondents did not know the program’s name or 
features but were still making payments (or receiving third-party assistance with plan 
payments), which would lead us to underestimate participation rates in that part of the 
program.
Fifth, our analysis of employment focused only on Kansas, based on survey length 
considerations in each state and the total study budget. However, work requirements are 
clearly also relevant in Indiana (which has received approval to implement them) and Ohio 
(which has proposed doing so). Moreover, our survey did not assess the reasons why people 
might not be working, though these issues have been evaluated in other research.16
Finally, type of insurance coverage was self-reported. Respondents might have incorrectly 
reported their type of coverage, particularly in Indiana—since confusion among HIP 2.0 
beneficiaries is a major challenge.7 We tried to mitigate the effects of this by including 
multiple state-specific names in the survey (for example, Medicaid, HIP 2.0, and Healthy 
Indiana). But we cannot exclude the possibility that measurement error affected our 
estimates.
Study Results
Our sample consisted of 2,739 people—1,007 in Indiana, 1,000 in Kansas, and 732 in Ohio. 
(Appendix exhibit 1 presents descriptive statistics.)19 The sample in Ohio had a higher share 
(33 percent) of racial/ethnic minorities than those in the other states (26 percent in Indiana 
and 27 percent in Kansas), while the Kansas sample was disproportionately rural (48 
percent) compared to Indiana (27 percent) and Ohio (17 percent).
THREE-STATE COMPARISONS OF COVERAGE, ACCESS, AND SATISFACTION
Exhibit 2 shows differences in coverage, access to care, attitudes toward the ACA, and 
ratings of overall health care quality across the three states, after adjustment for 
sociodemographic features. We found significantly higher rates of Medicaid coverage (53.1 
percent versus 35.9 percent; p < 0.001) and lower uninsurance rates (14.7 percent versus 
19.9 percent; p = 0.06) in Ohio compared to Kansas, but no significant differences between 
the two expansion states (Ohio and Indiana). Rates of having a personal doctor were similar

 in all three states. Rates of delaying care due to cost were higher in Kansas (p = 0.04) and 
Indiana (p = 0.06) than in Ohio. Respondents in Kansas were less likely to say that the ACA 
had helped them, compared to respondents in Ohio and Indiana, while those in Kansas and 
Indiana were more likely to say that the ACA had hurt them, compared to those in Ohio. 
Average health care ratings (on a 0–10 scale) were highest in Ohio and lowest in Kansas (7.3 
versus 6.9; p = 0.03), with Indiana in between (7.1; p = 0.22 compared to Ohio). (Appendix 
exhibit 2 shows full regression results for selected outcomes.)19
CONSUMER EXPERIENCE IN THE HEALTHY INDIANA PLAN
Among respondents in Indiana who reported having Medicaid coverage and who were likely 
enrolled in HIP 2.0 (that is, they were not receiving disability-related income or pregnant), 
39 percent said that they had not heard of the POWER accounts, 26 percent had heard of 
them but were not consistently making required payments, and 36 percent were making 
regular payments (exhibit 3). The most common reason for nonpayment was affordability 
(31 percent), while 22 percent of respondents said that they didn’t think the additional 
benefits were worth the money, and 19 percent were confused about the accounts.
Among those familiar with the POWER accounts, 57 percent agreed or strongly agreed that 
their account “helps me think about the health services I really need,” while 40 percent 
agreed or strongly agreed that the accounts were hard to understand or made it difficult to 
obtain necessary care. Nine percent of uninsured respondents in Indiana reported that they 
had been locked out of coverage as a result of premium nonpayment.
We found that various demographic characteristics served as predictors of several of these 
outcomes (appendix exhibit 3).19 Among Indiana Medicaid beneficiaries, Latinos, men, and 
those with less education were significantly less likely to have heard about the POWER 
accounts than whites, women, and those with more education, respectively. Younger adults 
were more critical of the accounts than adults ages forty-five and older.
ATTITUDES ABOUT MEDICAID EXPANSION AND WORK REQUIREMENTS IN KANSAS
Three-fourths of respondents in Kansas supported Medicaid expansion in the state, and just 
11 percent were opposed (exhibit 4). More than two-thirds said that they would receive 
higher-quality care if they had Medicaid than if they had no insurance, and only 9 percent 
said that the quality of care under Medicaid was worse than that with no coverage. In a 
comparison of Medicaid and private insurance, 32 percent said that quality was better with 
Medicaid, 31 percent said that it was better with private coverage, and 37 percent felt that it 
was similar with either type of insurance.
Work requirements would affect a fairly small share of the state’s potential Medicaid 
population. Of those with Medicaid currently or without any coverage (who would 
presumably be eligible if the state expanded Medicaid), 49 percent reported that they were 
working, and 34 percent had a disability that kept them from working. Eleven percent were 
not working but said that they would be more likely to look for a job if that was required as a 
condition of obtaining Medicaid; 6 percent were not working and said that they would not be 
more likely to look for work even if required. A multivariate analysis (appendix exhibit 4)19

 indicated that among those not working, a Medicaid work requirement would significantly 
increase rates of job seeking among single adults, Latinos, and people living in rural areas.
Discussion
With more than a dozen states proposing or implementing new Medicaid waivers over the 
past three years, evaluating low-income adults’ experiences in and attitudes toward waiver 
program features is critical. Using data from a novel survey of more than 2,700 low-income 
adults in three states, we found a mixed picture of the current and potential future effects of 
several waiver provisions.
WAIVER-BASED MEDICAID EXPANSION
Three years into the implementation of the consumer-based Healthy Indiana Plan, HIP 2.0, 
we found that nearly 40 percent of beneficiaries likely eligible for the program were 
unaware of the existence of the required POWER accounts that are one of the state’s key 
innovations. Given that another 26 percent of respondents were not making regular 
payments to their accounts, we estimate that as many as two-thirds of recipients could be at 
risk for losing benefits such as vision and dental care or being temporarily locked out of the 
program.
In touting HIP’s success, officials have said that “70 percent of HIP members make POWER 
account contributions.”24 This appears to refer to a state evaluation conducted by the Lewin 
Group,13 which reported a 29 percent rate of disenrollment from the program among those 
subject to that penalty (that is, people with incomes of 101–138 percent of poverty and not 
medically frail). However, this is not the same as the overall share of people who signed up 
for HIP who paid their premiums. This estimate excluded HIP Basic members, most of 
whom never made any payments and thus weren’t enrolled in HIP Plus in the first place. 
Elsewhere in the Lewin report, as highlighted by the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation in a 
critique of that evaluation,25 two broader measures of payment rates were reported: 57 
percent of those with incomes at or below 100 percent of poverty were moved to HIP Basic 
for nonpayment, and 51 percent of those with incomes above 100 percent of poverty who 
applied for and were deemed eligible for HIP 2.0 did not make premium payments—figures 
that are much closer to our estimates. In addition, the Lewin survey had a lower response 
rate (4.8 percent) than our survey did, and it did not use demographic weighting to reduce 
non-response bias.13
Troublingly, we found that lack of awareness of the program was highest among Latinos and 
less-educated adults, which could exacerbate disparities compared to traditional Medicaid. 
Meanwhile, 9 percent of uninsured respondents in Indiana reported being locked out of 
benefits because they did not make POWER account payments as required.
These findings are consistent with findings from studies of Medicaid waivers in Iowa and 
Michigan, which indicate that many enrollees do not participate in consumer-directed 
provisions in their states’ Medicaid expansions, often because of confusion or lack of 
awareness.7,26 In Michigan, fewer than 20 percent of Medicaid enrollees participated in a 
mandatory health risk assessment,27 and as of July 2016, more than 100,000 Healthy

 Michigan enrollees had past due out-of-pocket payments.7 In Iowa, just 17 percent of 
enrollees completed the program’s health-promoting activities (such as a wellness exam and 
health risk assessment), and one of the primary drivers of nonparticipation was lack of 
information.26 Researchers also found that disenrollment (typically for premium 
nonpayment) in Iowa led to financial hardship and barriers to care.28
While only a minority of Indiana residents with Medicaid knew about and were making 
regular payments to POWER accounts, many in this subgroup had favorable opinions of the 
accounts. Fifty-seven percent of respondents familiar with the accounts reported that the 
program helped them think about which health care services they needed. Increasing cost-
based awareness and consumerism in health care was one of the chief arguments the 
program’s creators put forward in favor of Indiana’s waiver approach,24 and that goal was 
met for the minority of beneficiaries who understood and paid into the program. However, 
taking into account the substantial confusion about Indiana’s program and its cost-sharing 
requirements, it is perhaps not surprising that difficulties affording care were higher in 
Indiana than in Ohio, which implemented a traditional Medicaid expansion with minimal 
cost sharing. While we found similar overall coverage rates in Indiana and Ohio, a recent 
study using a larger national data set found that Indiana’s coverage gains lagged behind 
those of its Midwestern neighbors, perhaps in part because of HIP 2.0’s cost-sharing 
requirements.29
Interestingly, Indianans were also more likely than Ohioans to report that the ACA had hurt 
them, though our results do not enable us to determine what led to this disparity in 
perceptions of the law. While Indiana modified aspects of HIP in its waiver renewal 
approved by CMS in February 2018 (including the addition of work requirements for 2019), 
the core features we evaluated here—the POWER accounts and lockout periods—remain in 
effect.
EXPANSION VERSUS NONEXPANSION
In Kansas, which has yet to expand Medicaid, we found very strong support for expansion 
among low-income adults in that state. This is consistent with public opinion in prior 
national and single-state studies.30,31 While most respondents agreed that having Medicaid 
was better than being uninsured, there was no clear preference for Medicaid versus private 
coverage in terms of quality of care.
Our cross-state comparisons demonstrate that the uninsurance rate, cost-related barriers to 
care, health care ratings, and problems paying medical bills were all significantly worse 
among low-income adults in Kansas, compared to those in Ohio—which had a traditional 
expansion of Medicaid. While these findings are only cross-sectional (albeit adjusted for 
sociodemographic factors), the basic pattern is consistent with quasi-experimental studies of 
expansion versus non-expansion states that have shown significant gains in coverage and 
access to and affordability of care after Medicaid expansion.2–5
WORK REQUIREMENTS
Our results in Kansas also shed light on the push for Medicaid work requirements in several 
states. Consistent with prior analyses,16,17,32 our study showed that most potential Medicaid

Author Manuscript
 beneficiaries are either already working or disabled. We add a new finding to this literature: 
Only 11 percent of potential Medicaid beneficiaries reported that a work requirement would 
have any effect on their looking for a job, though this did represent more than half of the 17 
percent who were not working and were not disabled. Notably, this potential effect was 
disproportionately reported by rural adults—which raises questions as to the availability of 
employment for people who would look for work if required, given the paucity of new jobs 
in rural areas over the past decade.33
Advocates of work requirements have pointed to the positive association between 
employment and health to argue that the policy could improve Medicaid health outcomes by 
inducing more beneficiaries to work34 (though the causality of this relationship is unclear). 
Our findings suggest that work requirements would likely produce modest impacts on job-
searching behavior in this population, inducing some people to look for jobs but not 
changing the likelihood of employment for the vast majority (nearly 90 percent) of people 
who might enroll in Medicaid. This builds on prior evidence that the ACA’s Medicaid 
expansion has had no detectable impact to date on employment decisions among low-
income adults.35,36
ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS
While our findings do not shed light directly on the costs of administering health savings 
accounts or work requirements, such costs are another consideration for Indiana’s POWER 
accounts and potential work requirements in Kansas or any other state. Implementing these 
alternative approaches requires additional resources. Even though the POWER accounts in 
Indiana built upon HIP 1.0, the predecessor of HIP 2.0, the expansion substantially increased 
per beneficiary administrative requirements. One study indicated that Indiana’s Medicaid 
managed care organizations had to increase administrative staffing ratios and devote more 
time to meet the state’s requirements for oversight of the POWER accounts.37 While Indiana 
officials have not released estimates of the program’s administrative costs, officials in 
Arkansas estimated that administrative costs for that state’s health savings accounts in 
Medicaid were over $1,100 per participating beneficiary per year.37
The costs to states of these accounts may outweigh the relatively modest benefits noted 
among some Indiana respondents in our survey. Similarly, a work requirement that changes 
behavior for only a tenth of the population but requires verification of employment or 
exemptions for medical frailty and other hardships for the vast majority of beneficiaries also 
raises concerns about administrative efficiency.16
Our findings suggest that work requirements would likely produce modest impacts 
on job-searching behavior in this population.
Of course, these administrative costs may ultimately be outweighed in the Medicaid budget 
if total enrollment falls substantially as a result of these requirements, which may be another 
reason that states are considering these changes. While some people would lose coverage 
because they chose not to comply with the new requirements (for example, to look for work, 
contribute to a health savings account, or make premium payments), others may be 
dissuaded from applying or be removed from the Medicaid rolls because of the added

 administrative difficulty of applying or reenrolling, even though they may meet the 
program’s requirements.8
Conclusion
Among low-income adults in three Midwestern states, we found that coverage rates and 
access to care were significantly higher in the expansion states (Indiana and Ohio) than the 
nonexpansion state (Kansas), but there was also some evidence that Indiana’s waiver 
program led to less affordable care than Ohio’s traditional expansion of Medicaid did. 
Consumers’ confusion about the Healthy Indiana Plan and difficulty paying premiums may 
have offset benefits among the subset of enrollees who perceived the health savings accounts 
to be helpful. Low-income Kansans strongly supported Medicaid expansion in their state, 
while a work requirement would have effects on job-seeking behavior for approximately 10 
percent of the potential Medicaid population. These findings suggest that current Medicaid 
innovations may lead to unintended consequences for coverage and access and that ongoing 
independent monitoring of their effects is essential.
