Summary
The retention of episodic-like memory is enhanced, in humans and animals, when something novel 
happens shortly before or after encoding. Using an everyday memory task in mice, we sought the 
neurons mediating this dopamine-dependent novelty effect, previously thought to originate 
exclusively from the tyrosine hydroxylase-expressing (TH+) neurons in the ventral tegmental area 
(VTA). We report that neuronal firing in the locus coeruleus (LC) is especially sensitive to 
environmental novelty, LC-TH+ neurons project more profusely than VTA-TH+ neurons to the 
hippocampus, optogenetic activation of LC-TH+ neurons mimics the novelty effect, and this 
novelty-associated memory enhancement is unaffected by VTA inactivation. Surprisingly, two 
effects of LC-TH+ photoactivation are sensitive to hippocampal D1/D5 receptor blockade and 
resistant to adrenoceptors blockade – memory enhancement and long lasting potentiation of

 synaptic transmission in CA1 ex vivo. Thus, LC-TH+ neurons can mediate post-encoding memory 
enhancement in a manner consistent with possible co-release of dopamine in hippocampus.
Numerous studies of memory, for over a century1, have established that there is substantial 
forgetting within a day2. Everyday memory includes many episodic-like memories that we 
may form automatically3,4. Important memory traces may be retained for longer, indeed for 
sufficiently longer that they can then be subject to stabilisation in the neocortex via systems 
consolidation5,6. Selective stabilisation can occur when something novel or categorically 
relevant happens shortly before or after the time of memory encoding, sometimes called 
‘flashbulb memory’7,8. Prospective studies of novelty-associated enhancement of memory 
persistence in animals point to possible mechanisms9–14, with one suggestion being that a 
novelty signal from VTA to the hippocampus is causally important15,16. Pharmacological 
studies of protein synthesis-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term 
depression support the concept of dopamine (DA)-dependent enhancement of 
persistence13,17–19, but do not identify the neuronal source of DA. We anticipated that VTA-
TH+ neurons would be critical, but the possibility that LC-TH+ neurons can sometimes 
release DA as well as noradrenaline (NA)20–22 led to our broadening of the project to 
include LC-TH+ as well as VTA-TH+ neurons.
Novelty enhances memory persistence
We used 120 mice and began by checking that the enhancement of memory retention by 
environmental novelty, previously shown in rats12,13, could also be observed in mice. This 
testing deployed our ‘everyday’ memory task that is a model for ‘episodic-like’ or ‘one-shot’ 
memory23. We created a smaller arena for mice who searched for food reward in one of 23 
different sandwells whose location varied across days (Figs. 1a, S1a). Male tyrosine 
hydroxylase-Cre (Th-Cre) mice were trained to encode the changing daily location of reward 
in ‘sample’ trials, displaying effective memory in later daily ‘choice’ trials (with 5 
sandwells). The data plotted as a 5-alternative forced-choice performance index revealing 
stable choice performance (circa 80%) across weeks of testing (Figs. 1a, S1b,c). A control 
test (sessions 61–65) established the absence of olfactory artefacts. Daily memory was tested 
using a counterbalanced series of unrewarded probe tests (PTs) that only occasionally 
followed the daily sample trial(s) at different times. Reward availability on sample trials 
(memory encoding) was varied (low and high reward). Effective memory at 1 h (memory 
retrieval) was displayed in PTs for even the smallest reward (Fig. 1b), but forgetting across 
24 h showed an inverse relationship with reward magnitude (Figs. 1b, S1d). A key finding 
was that unexpected environmental novelty for 5 min – exploration of a box with unfamiliar 
floor surfaces placed inside the event arena 30 min after the encoding trial prolonged spatial 
memory to 24 h (Fig. 1b). This post-encoding novelty was environmental and not a change 
in reward expectancy.
Memory retention in this task is selectively impaired by pharmacological interventions 
targeting D1/D5 receptor in hippocampus in rats13 and in our mice with the β-adrenoceptor 
antagonist propranolol (Prop) during environmental novelty being without effect, whereas 
the D1/D5 receptor antagonist SCH23390 (SCH) blocked novelty-induced enhancement of

 memory persistence (Figs. 1c, S1e). However, the mechanism by which reward and 
environmental novelty modulate memory retention may be distinct.
TH+ neurons show a novelty response
The next step was to identify whether TH+ neurons are activated by environmental novelty. 
Th-Cre mice were given stereotaxic injections of a Cre-inducible adeno-associated virus 
(AAV) carrying Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) fused to enhanced yellow fluorescent protein 
(eYFP) into the VTA or LC (Figs. 2a, S2) and implanted with an ‘optetrode’ microdrive. 
Several weeks later, brief low frequency blue light illumination was used to identify ChR2-
eYFP-positive neurons in awake mice. TH+ neurons were identified (Figs. 2a; S3a, b), and 
recording then continued without light pulses as the mice explored both familiar (visited 
regularly) and novel chambers (visited rarely, and each time with a novel floor surface) for 5 
min in a counterbalanced sequence (Fig. 2b). Raster plots of representative cases show 
novelty affected light-responsive neurons within both structures (Fig. 2c), with increased 
firing rates in most identified VTA-TH+ (12/15 neurons recorded) and all LC-TH+ (10/10) 
neurons (Fig. 2d). Firing rate modulation was not only quantitatively larger for LC-TH+ 
neurons, but also a clear increase from their usual tonic firing rate24 and habituated 
monotonically over time (Figs. 2e, S3c; Ref25). Both VTA-TH+ and LC-TH+ neurons 
showed a higher occurrence of bursts in novel environments (Fig. S3d), with a within-burst 
spike frequency of 12.8 to 53.4 Hz (Fig. S3e). This bursting pattern in both VTA and LC 
was intentionally used to determine an effective optogenetic stimulation protocol for both in 
vivo and ex vivo experiments.
LC projects extensively to hippocampus
Previous retrograde tracing and immunohistochemical work in the rat has estimated that 
only a subset of VTA afferents to the hippocampus are dopaminergic26. Focusing on TH+ 
neurons in mice, anatomical tract tracing revealed substantial projections from LC-TH+ 
neurons to the dorsal hippocampus, but a paucity of such projections from VTA-TH+ 
neurons (Figs. 3, S5). Cell-type specific anterograde tracing involved unilateral injection of a 
Cre-inducible eYFP virus into VTA or LC of Th-Cre mice (Fig. 3a–f). Most TH+ neurons in 
VTA and LC expressed eYFP (Fig. S2g). We first established co-localisation of TH in 
eYFP+ axons in the dorsal hippocampus (Fig. 3b, d – top panels), and then co-localisation of 
eYFP, TH and the noradrenergic transporter (NET) for LC- but not VTA-axons (Figs. 3b, d – 
bottom panels; see also Fig. S4). We identified and quantified eYFP+ axons projecting to the 
hippocampus, calculating both the area occupied by all eYFP-TH double-positive axons 
(Fig. 3e) and the ratio of double-positive axons relative to all TH+ axons (Fig. 3f). The data 
showed an overwhelmingly larger proportion of axons from LC-TH+ neurons with very few 
from VTA-TH+ neurons (see also Ref21 and Fig. S7a). Retrograde tracing involved injecting 
fluorescent retrobeads into the dorsal hippocampus and examining retrograde transport to 
VTA (Fig. S5a, b) or LC (Fig. S5c, d). Double-labelled neurons (retrobeads and TH-
positivity) were specific to LC.

 LC activation mimics the novelty effect
The overarching aim of this project was to identify neuromodulatory neurons whose firing 
promotes the consolidation of hippocampal-dependent memory. While we had originally 
planned to examine VTA-TH+ neurons, our data so far pointed to the need to change our 
focus to LC-TH+ neurons as likely mediators of environmental novelty. An optimum 
optogenetic burst stimulation frequency of 25 Hz was chosen (Fig. 4b) based on our within-
burst firing data (Fig. S3e); both LC-TH+ and VTA-TH+ neurons could follow this 
frequency in awake mice (Fig. S6a). Th-Cre mice were stereotaxically prepared with 
bilateral injections of Cre-inducible ChR2-eYFP virus (ChR2+) or a no opsin control (eYFP) 
virus (ChR2−) followed by implantation of bilateral optic cannulae into both LC and VTA 
and bilateral drug cannulae targeting the dorsal hippocampus (Fig. 4a). These animals were 
trained on the ‘everyday’ memory task until they were performing with a performance index 
at circa 75%, and showed effective memory in a 10-min probe test (Fig. S6b, c). The stage 
was then set for examining whether 5 min optogenetic activation, scheduled 30 min after 
memory encoding in place of environmental novelty, could mimic its beneficial effects on 
memory retention (Fig. 4c).
The key finding of this study was the striking persistence of memory over 24 h when 5 min 
of intermittent burst stimulation of LC-TH+ neurons with blue light was given to the ChR2+ 
mice in their home cages (Fig. 4d). Tested 24 h after weak memory encoding, LC activated 
ChR2+ animals remembered the location of the sample sandwell sampled 30 min prior to 
light activation (Fig. 4d left; ChR2+ in LC-ON, 52.2% correct dig). Memory that lasted 24 h 
was not observed in these mice without LC light stimulation (ChR2+ in OFF), nor seen in 
separate ChR2− controls. Light-activation of VTA, in the same ChR2+ animals, brought 
about only a non-significant trend favouring some memory at 24 h, but we observed a 
similar trend in ChR2− mice (Fig. 4d right, compare ChR2+ and ChR2− in VTA-ON). Not 
only did these upwards trends not differ from chance, they also did not differ from each 
other, suggesting that the trend is unrelated to light-activation of ChR2-positive neurons in 
VTA (e.g. light-induced temperature changes27).
While compatible with our electrophysiological and anatomical observations on LC-TH+ 
neurons (Figs. 2 and 3), we were confronted by the paradox that light activation of LC 
enhances retention (Fig. 4d) but intrahippocampal infusion of a D1/D5 receptor antagonist 
during behavioural novelty blocks it (Fig. 1c). Accordingly, we examined the impact of post-
encoding microinfusion of catecholaminergic antagonists into the hippocampus before 
optogenetic activation of LC (Fig. 4e). We confirmed that light activation of LC in ChR2+ 
mice enhanced 24-h spatial memory (Fig. 4f; ChR2+ in LC-ON with vehicle) whereas, in 
agreement with Fig. 1c, this effect was blocked by intrahippocampal D1/D5 receptor 
antagonist (ChR2+ in LC-ON with SCH) but not by β-adrenoceptor antagonist (ChR2+ in 
LC-ON with Prop; see also Fig. S6d). This raises the possibility of heterodimerization 
between NA and DA receptors or that LC-TH+ axons in the hippocampus may co-release 
DA.

 LC activation enhances synaptic efficacy
To explore one possible mechanism of this enhancement of memory, we conducted ex vivo 
electrophysiological experiments to examine the response of CA1 pyramidal neurons in 
hippocampus to CA3 Schaffer collateral glutamatergic synaptic input (Fig. 5a). Three weeks 
prior to obtaining the slices, bilateral injections of Cre-inducible ChR2-eYFP virus were 
made into the LC of Th-Cre mice (Fig. S7a) in keeping with the recently described ‘output-
defined elements’ concept28.
Following three trains of burst optogenetic stimulation of hippocampal LC-TH+ axons (Fig. 
S7b), the CA3 to CA1 excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) measured using whole-cell 
recording gradually increased by 55% over ~30 min (Fig. 5b, Light-ON), an increase 
unaffected by the presence of the α- and β-adrenoceptors antagonists, prazosin (Praz) and 
propranolol (Prop) (Light-ON with Praz/Prop). In contrast, there was no increase of the 
EPSC following optogenetic LC-TH+ activation in the presence of D1/D5 receptor 
antagonists (Light-ON with SCH), revealing a pattern of EPSC potentiation consistent with 
mediation by a dopaminergic mechanism.
LTP at CA3 to CA1 synapses was then examined using theta-burst stimulation to induce 
LTP (see Methods). As in the optogenetic behavioural study (Fig. 4), hippocampal LC-TH+ 
axons were selectively activated with a protocol closely mimicking LC-TH+ firing patterns 
recorded during novelty exploration (Fig. S7c). LTP differed in magnitude across 4 
conditions (Fig. 5c). Theta-burst stimulation alone induced LTP at 45 min of 29% (Light-
OFF + LTP) relative to a no-LTP baseline [Light-ON (no LTP)]; this increased to 59% when 
combined with optogenetic LC-TH+ activation (Light-ON + LTP); but D1/D5 receptor 
antagonist blocked this augmentation (Light-ON + LTP with SCH). Taken together, these 
electrophysiological findings indicate that depolarisation of hippocampal LC-TH+ axons by 
optogenetic stimulation can enhance synaptic transmission, and that a physiologic-like 
pattern potentiates LTP at CA3-CA1 synapses in a manner consistent with release of DA 
from hippocampal LC-TH+ terminals.
VTA blockade has no impact on novelty effect
Last, we turned to attempting to block LC-TH+ neurons during novelty to see if memory 
enhancement disappeared. Acute electrophysiological studies showed that firing of LC-TH+ 
neurons expressing the membrane trafficking-enhanced variants of archaerhodopsin 
(eArch3.0)-eYFP could be successfully inhibited by green light over 5 min (Fig. S8). 
However, these TH+ neurons always displayed a substantial ‘rebound’ of firing when the 
light was turned off29. Were this rebound to occur in a behavioural study of memory, the 
rebound would likely overcome the earlier 5 min period of neuronal quiescence.
At this point, we already had the Th-Cre mice expressing eArch3.0-eYFP or eYFP in LC 
trained in the everyday memory task showing comparable levels of task performance to 
those of the earlier experiments (Fig. S9a, b), displaying within-day forgetting with low-
reward encoding (Fig. 6c). While unable to use eArch3.0, we had the mice had bilateral drug 
cannulae targeting VTA. The sodium channel blocker lidocaine successfully inhibited VTA

 neuronal firing in separate acute electrophysiology experiments (Fig. 6a). We then examined 
the impact of intra-VTA infusion of lidocaine during novelty exploration (Figs. 6b and S9c). 
There was no effect, as we expected. It was then necessary to confirm that this novelty effect 
was sensitive a manipulation that inhibits LC neurons (but may have other effects), such as 
the α2-adrenoceptor agonist clonidine30 (and personal communication with O. Eschenko, 
MPI-Tuebingen). The mice were given a series of counterbalanced probe tests (Figs. 6c and 
S9c). One test showed normal forgetting over 24 h with low-reward encoding (No novelty 
with Vehicle), another the usual enhanced retention induced by environmental novelty 
(Novelty with Vehicle). Critically, systemic clonidine blocked the effect of novelty on 24 h 
memory retention (Novelty with Clonidine).
Discussion
These experiments sought to identify neuromodulatory neurons that, in response to 
environmental novelty, trigger intracellular signal-transduction cascades within hippocampal 
neurons responsible for the initial consolidation of everyday memory15,31,32. Lisman and 
Grace15 proposed that a mediator of novelty-associated enhancement of hippocampal-
dependent memory was a subiculum-accumbens-pallidal-VTA-CA1 pathway, an idea 
supported by both animal work and human studies33. Our data indicate, however, that VTA-
TH+ neurons display weak anatomical connectivity with hippocampus, are only slightly 
activated by environmental novelty, and their pharmacological blockade during novelty has 
no effect on memory enhancement. In contrast, LC-TH+ neuronal firing is more responsive 
to environmental novelty and displays habituation of enhanced firing over 5 min. An 
overwhelming majority of hippocampal TH+ axons come from LC, and their post-encoding 
optogenetic activation successfully enhances memory retention. The drug clonidine that 
decreases neuronal activity in LC30, but not in VTA34, prevents this novelty effect. At the 
synaptic level ex vivo, selective optogenetic activation of LC-TH+ axons in hippocampus 
mediates a D1/D5 receptor-sensitive enhancement of synaptic transmission and of 
electrically evoked LTP at CA3-CA1 synapses, consistent with the idea that LC-TH+ 
neurons might co-release DA20,21. Transmitter co-release from substantia nigra (SN)/VTA-
TH+ terminals, including glutamate and GABA, has been reported35,36. Lisman and his 
colleagues have modified their model to recognise this latter possibility37, rescuing DA 
receptor-dependence at the expense of recognising a different circuit for mediating the 
impact of environmental novelty on hippocampal memory.
Importantly, environmental novelty is different from changes in reward expectancy or 
magnitude. Reward expectancy is a critical component of the execution of learned actions 
until they become habitual38. Longstanding data point to the role of SN/VTA system in the 
processing of unexpected reward in striatal39–41 and hippocampal tasks42. VTA terminal 
activation can bidirectionally modulate CA3-CA1 synaptic responses ex vivo43, but in our in 
vivo study, post-encoding VTA-TH+ activation was without functional effect. Environmental 
novelty, in contrast to reward expectancy, is when something unexpected happens unrelated 
to reward during ongoing behaviour. It is likely to affect a distinct neuromodulatory system, 
but one with extensive connectivity to the hippocampus where it could activate processes 
including the synthesis and capture of plasticity-related proteins31. In this way, unexpected 
environmental novelty could enhance memory retention. The noradrenergic system of the

 LC, with its diverse projections to numerous brain areas44 has long been implicated in 
novelty, arousal and cognition24,45,46 and its firing is tied to distinct up and down states 
during sleep47. It appears that the time periods over which LC neurons exert their effects are 
much less precise than for VTA, in keeping with the synaptic tagging-and-capture 
hypothesis48–50. This idea has functional implications that extend well beyond the domain of 
LTP, affecting the retention of events via neural activity happening before and after the 
precise moment that encoding occurs, as in flashbulb memory7. In this and other ways, the 
retention of everyday experience is modulated over a period of time and not just at the 
precise moment that individual events are encoded.
Methods
Animals
The subjects were Th-Cre knock-in heterozygous male mice backcrossed more than 20 
times to the C57BL/6 strain (Thtm1(cre)Te; EM:00254)51 (behavioural and anatomical studies, 
n = 71 mice), Th-Cre transgenic heterozygous male mice on a mixed C57BL/6 and CD1 
background [Tg(Th-cre)1Tmd]52 (for ex vivo hippocampal electrophysiology, n = 42), and 
C57BL/6 male mice (Charles River; n = 7). They were > 8 weeks old at the start of the 
experiments, several of which continued for many months. All mice were given water ad 
libidum, kept under a 12 h light/dark cycle (lights on 7:00 am); given food ad libidum in unit 
recording studies but food-restricted for event arena training (85% of free-feeding weight 
monitored daily throughout the study, after behavioural training). Behavioural testing was 
carried out during the light phase of the cycle. All procedures were overseen by the 
University of Edinburgh Ethical Review Committee, compliant with the UK Animals 
(Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 and with the European Communities Council Directive of 
24 November 1986 (86/609/EEC) legislation governing the maintenance of laboratory 
animals and their use in scientific experiments; and with guidelines of the Animal Welfare 
Committee of Hokkaido University; were approved by the animal care and use committee 
(IACUC) at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center and comply with federal 
regulations set forth by the National Institutes of Health.
Viral vectors
The Cre-inducible AAV were obtained from the University of North Carolina (UNC) Vector 
Core Facilities. The viral concentration was 8.0 × 1012 particles ml−1 for AAV5/EF1a-DIO-
hChR2(H134R)-eYFP (ChR2-eYFP), 3.2 × 1012 particles ml−1 for AAV5/EF1a-DIO-
eArch3.0-eYFP (eArch3.0-eYFP), 4.0 × 1012 particles ml−1 for AAV5/EF1a-DIO-
eNpHR3.0-eYFP (eNpHR3.0-eYFP), 4.0 × 1012 particles ml−1 for AAV5/EF1a-DIO-eYFP 
(eYFP control), and 1–7 × 1012 particles ml−1 for AAV2/EF1a-DIO-hChR2(H134R)-eYFP 
(for ex vivo hippocampal electrophysiology). Virus were subdivided into aliquots stored at 
−80°C until use.
Stereotactic surgery
Anaesthesia was induced using isoflurane (induction, 5%; maintenance, 1–2%; air-flow, 1 l 
min−1). The animals were placed in the stereotactic frame (Kopf Instruments). For viral or 
retrobead (Lumafluor) injection, a small hole was drilled into the skull over the target site.

 The virus (0.75–1 μl) or retrobead solution (0.1 μl) was then injected at 0.1 μl min−1 into the 
target site using a Nanofil syringe (WPI) and UMP3 pump (WPI) mounted directly on the 
stereotactic frame. After injection, a needle of the syringe was left for 10 min to reduce 
back-flow and then withdrawn slowly. Animals recovered on a heating pad until normal 
behaviour resumed. All experiments involving viral constructs were performed at least 3 
weeks after surgery in order to allow for sufficient expression. Viral infusion coordinates 
were: VTA [from bregma53: anterior-posterior (AP), −3.50 mm; mediolateral (ML), 0.50 
mm; and dorsal-ventral (DV) from the dura, −4.40 mm] ] and LC (AP, −5.45 mm; ML, 1.20 
mm; and DV, −3.65 mm).
Event arena pharmacological experiment (Fig. 1)—Bilateral 26-gauge 
microinjection steel guide cannulae (2.5 mm length, 3.0 mm distance between cannulae; 
Plastics One) with stylets that protruded 0.5 mm below the end of the cannula (33 gauge, 
Plastics One) were then implanted into the dorsal hippocampus. The cannula implantation 
co-ordinates were (AP, −2.10 mm; ML, ±1.50 mm; and DV, −2.00 mm).
Extracellular recording in a novelty exploration paradigm (Fig. 2)—the Cre-
inducible AAV5 ChR2-eYFP virus (1 μl) was unilaterally injected into VTA or LC as 
mentioned above. Four jeweller’s screws were then placed in the skull and the ground wire 
was attached to one of the skull screws. The microdrive implantation co-ordinates were: 
VTA (AP, −3.52 mm; ML, 0.48 mm; and DV, −4.00 mm) and LC (AP, −5.45 mm; ML, 1.00 
mm; and DV, −2.80 mm). Adhesive cement (C&B metabond, Parkell) and dental acrylic 
were then sculpted around the microdrive.
Tract tracing experiment (Figs. 3 and S5)—For anterograde tracing, the Cre-inducible 
AAV5 eYFP virus (1 μl) was unilaterally injected into VTA or LC as described above. For 
retrograde tracing, retrobeads (0.1 μl) were unilaterally injected into CA1 (AP, −2.18 mm; 
ML, 1.18 mm; and DV, −1.36 mm), CA3 (AP, −2.18 mm; ML, 2.68 mm; and DV, −2.05 
mm) and DG (AP, −2.18 mm; ML, 1.36 mm; and DV, −1.82 mm).
Event arena experiment with optogenetics (Fig. 4)—Arterial oxygen saturation, 
heart rate and breath rate were monitored by MouseOx instrument (STARR Life Science). 
The Cre-inducible AAV5 virus (ChR2-eYFP or eYFP, 1 μl per side) was injected bilaterally 
into VTA and LC according to the procedure described above. A dual ferrule optical fibre 
implant (0.22 NA, 200 μm core diameter; Doric Lenses) was implanted vertically into VTA 
(AP, −3.40 mm; ML, ±0.50 mm; and DV, −4.30 mm). Subsequently, a two-ferrule optical 
fibre implant (0.22 NA, 200 μm; Doric Lenses) was implanted into LC at −30° angle to 
coronal plane (AP, −5.45 mm; ML, ±0.90 mm; and DV, −3.00 mm). Additionally, bilateral 
26-gauge steel guide cannulae (4.0 mm length, 3.0 mm distance between cannulae) with 
stylets (33 gauge) that protruded 0.5 mm below the end of the cannula was inserted into the 
dorsal hippocampus at a 40° angle to coronal plane (AP, −2.10 mm; ML, ±1.50 mm; and 
DV, −2.00 mm).
Event arena experiment with pharmacological inactivation (Fig. 6)—The Cre-
inducible AAV5 virus (eArch3.0-eYFP or eYFP, 1 μl per side) was injected bilaterally into 
LC, and a two-ferrule optical fibre implant was then implanted into LC at −30° angle to

mm length, 1.0 mm distance between cannulae) with stylets (33 gauge) that protruded 0.5 
mm below the end of the cannula was inserted into VTA (AP, −3.40 mm; ML, ±0.50 mm; 
and DV, −4.40 mm).
Ex vivo hippocampal electrophysiology (Fig. 5)—The Cre-inducible AAV2 ChR2-
eYFP virus (0.75–1 μl per side) was bilaterally injected into LC (AP, −5.45 mm; ML, ±0.90 
mm; and DV, −3.00 mm) over a 10–15 min period using a borosilicate glass electrode (10–
15 MΩ) pulled with a horizontal pipet puller (P-97, Sutter Instrument) and a picospritzer 
(Parker) timed by a Master-8 pulse stimulator (A.M.P.I.). After each injection, the pipette 
was kept in place for 5 min to ensure proper diffusion of the virus.
Postoperative analgesia—Carprofen (0.08 ml kg−1 body weight), or buprenorphine (0.1 
mg kg−1 body weight), was administered by subcutaneous injection at the end of all surgical 
procedures. All mice were allowed a recovery period of at least 7 days in order for them to 
regain their pre-surgery weights before electrophysiological or behavioural testing.
Everyday memory apparatus
Everyday memory was tested in an event arena − a square open field (120 cm wide × 120 
cm long) with walls (35 cm high) made out of transparent Plexiglas (Fig. 1a) with 4 adjacent 
start boxes (black plexiglass). The name ‘event arena’ derives from it being an arena in 
which ‘events’ happen (e.g. finding food)13. The floor of the arena, arranged in a 5 × 5 grid, 
was covered with ~2 cm of sawdust and had two intramaze landmarks (a white metal cube 
located at row 3, column 2, and a black rubber flash light at row 3, column 4). The Plexiglas 
sandwells, in which food reward was potentially available, could be fitted into any of the 23 
remaining sandwell positions (positions occupied by internal cues were excluded). The mice 
had access to the arena and sandwells when the startbox door was opened in any trials. Light 
levels, checked every day, were 25–35 lux. Data was recorded using custom-made 
LabVIEW software (National Instruments), using the image from camera placed above the 
arena.
Novelty apparatus
For novelty exploration, a square Plexiglas open field with transparent walls (70 cm wide × 
70 cm long × 30 cm high) was placed in the middle of the event arena (Fig. 1b). In order to 
maintain the novelty of the environment, a wide range of floor substrates (dried leaves, 
shredded paper, feathers, acrylic pompoms, corks, lolly sticks, Lego blocks, pipe cleaners, 
shredded straws, and sea shells) that covered the floor of the box were used, as in a 
previously published protocol that used rats13.
Event arena tasks
Sample size, randomization, blinding and replication—A distinctive feature of 
event arena tasks is that most but not all comparisons are ‘within-subjects’ design in which 
every single subjects are exposed to every single treatment, including the control treatment. 
This typically reduces the number of subjects required for statistical significance and avoids 
issues associated with randomization. All non-rewarded probe tests (see below) were

 analysed blind and, being conducted against a stable performance background, were 
typically conducted twice or three times (internal replication). Averaging data helped reduce 
variability.
Shaping and habituation—After handling, habituation (8 sessions) involved training 
mice to dig in the sandwells to retrieve food (a half of cereal ‘cheerios’) and carry it to the 
start box.
Everyday training protocol—The goal in each daily session was to encode the changing 
daily location of a rewarded sandwell encountered during two consecutive sample trials (2 
retrievals of buried food in each trial), and then, 10 min later, return to that same location 
during the choice trial (Fig. 1a). The choice trial was a retrieval test that involved a rewarded 
sandwell in a location that matched the sample location (the “correct” location; win-stay 
rule) and 4 non-rewarded sandwells placed in other locations around the arena (the 
“incorrect” locations). Training sessions were conducted daily (5–7 sessions per week) using 
16 different sandwell configurations with rewarded sandwell positions counterbalanced 
between mice (Fig. S1a). We calculated a performance index (PI), using a formula 
PI=100−[100×(errors/4)], based on the number of errors made during the choice trial (an 
error being digging at an incorrect sandwell). The value expected based on chance was 50% 
(2 errors). With each behavioural cohort, we began conducting critical memory probe tests 
once mice reached average performance index of 75% (equivalent to 1 error, computed as 
average of last 5 training sessions). This typically happened within 35 training sessions, but 
sometimes additional training was needed due after complex surgical procedures.
Memory probe tests—The primary data measure of the study were derived from 
‘memory tests’ performed as ‘probe’ tests – a session in which none of the sandwells 
contained any accessible food pellets. The mice were cued with a food pellet in the start box, 
and then allowed to search for the correct sandwell for 60 s from the first dig of any 
sandwell. After 60 s, the experimenter quietly entered the room and buried pellets in the 
correct sandwell, allowing the mouse to retrieve them (one by one as in training, this limited 
‘extinction’). Dig time at each sandwells was measured, and the relative proportion of time 
at the correct and incorrect sandwells was calculated. The value expected based on chance 
was 20%. Probe tests were always separated by at least 2 sessions of regular training. In the 
‘reward magnitude’ probe test (Figs. 1b, S1d), animals retrieved either two pellets (low 
reward) or eight pellets (high reward) during memory encoding.
Novelty exploration—The mice underwent 7 sessions of habituation to the box with 
sawdust placed in the event arena. For post-encoding unexpected environmental novelty, the 
mouse was placed into the centre of the box lined with a novel substrate and allowed to 
explore freely for 5 min.
Behavioural pharmacology
Microinfusion/injection of drugs—To help reduce any stress, all drugs were infused in 
the home cages. The stylets in the guide cannulae were replaced by a double infusion 
cannula (33 gauge, Plastics One) connected to two 5 μl microsyringes (WPI) in a

 microinfusion pump (Native Instruments) via flexible plastic tubing (C232CS, Plastics One) 
filled with Fluorinert (3M). The tips of infusion cannulae projected 0.5 mm below the tip of 
the guide cannulae. For intra-hippocampal microinjection, 0.5 μl of drug per cannula was 
infused at 0.2 μl min−1 (2.5 min). Infusion cannulas were left in place for a further 2.5 min 
before being replaced with stylets to aid drug absorption. For intra-VTA microinjection, 0.3 
μl was injected at a rate of 0.3 μl min−1 (1 min) followed by 1-min of waiting. The mice 
were habituated to the experimental procedure of injection and to vehicle injection prior to 
the drug test in order to minimize novelty effect. Mice received drug injection 20 min 
(hippocampal microinfusions and i.p. injection of clonidine) or 3 min (VTA microinfusions) 
prior to the novelty exploration.
Drug concentrations—For microinfusions, the concentrations used were 21.1 mM (6.25 
μg μl−1) for β-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol [(S)-(−)-propranolol hydrochloride, 
295.80 g mol−1; Sigma-Aldrich), 3.1 mM (1 μg μl−1) for D1/D5 receptor antagonist 
SCH23390 (SCH 23390 hydrochloride, 324.24 g mol−1; Tocris) and 2% w/v for voltage-
gated sodium channel blocker lidocaine (lidocaine hydrochloride monohydrate, 288.81 g 
mol−1; Sigma-Aldrich). α2-adrenoceptor agonist clonidine (clonidine hydrochloride, 266.55 
g mol−1; Sigma-Aldrich) was administered i.p. at a dose of 50 μg kg−1 of body weight. We 
used 0.9% NaCl (saline) in H2O as a vehicle and for control infusions. Both vehicle and 
drug solutions were stored in 100 μl aliquots at −20°C until use.
Optogenetic photostimulation in the event arena experiment
The mice were extensively habituated to the experimental procedure of photostimulation and 
to flickering blue light for several weeks prior to the optogenetic photostimulation test in 
order to minimize the potential novelty of the procedure. Laser stimulation, consisting of 25 
Hz of twenty 5-ms pulses of 473-nm light, delivered every 5 s (average stimulation rate: 4 
Hz) for the duration of 5 min (Fig. 4b), was performed in home cages using two blue solid-
state diode pumped lasers (18–19 mW, Laser 2000) connected to either a dual fibre optic 
patch cord (for VTA; 0.22 NA, 200 μm core diameter; Doric Lenses) or two single fibre 
optic patch cords (for LC; 0.22 NA, 200 μm). Both lasers were synchronously controlled 
using custom-built LabVIEW software.
Extracellular recording in a novelty exploration paradigm
Apparatus and light stimulation—Unit activity was recorded extracellularly using the 
previously implanted custom-built screw-driven microdrive consisting of a 200 μm optic 
fibre surrounded by four tetrodes (an ‘optetrode’) that protruded 400–800 μm beyond the 
fibre tip54. Signals were fed through a 16 channel unity gain headstage amplifier (Axona), 
band-pass filtered at 300–5000 Hz, amplified 1 k–40 k times, digitized at 50 kHz and stored 
for subsequent analysis. Spike capturing was done on-line using amplitude threshold. 
Recorded neurons were identified as TH+ using Cre-dependent ChR2 expression and low-
frequency light stimulation55. Laser stimulation was performed using a blue solid-state 
diode pumped laser (473 nm, Laser 2000) connected to a fibre optic patch cord (0.22 NA, 
200 μm core diameter), and controlled with the data capturing software (Axona). Epochs of 
60 light pulses (1 Hz, 5 ms pulse duration) at different light intensities (0.1–20 mW) were 
then administered and each tetrode was screened for light-evoked spikes. Spikes were

 classified as ‘light-evoked’ if their latency from the onset of the light pulse was between 0 
and 15 ms, all other spikes being classified as ‘spontaneous’. Units were classified as light-
responsive if: (a) a cell fired a light-evoked spike in response to more than one third of light 
pulses, (b) the shape of the mean light-evoked waveform of a unit closely resembled the 
spontaneous waveform of the same unit. Units with basal firing rates above 20 Hz were 
excluded from this analysis because of intrinsically high probability of spiking within the 15 
ms window after the light pulse.
Novelty exploration—Two weeks after surgery, the implanted mice underwent 5 days of 
habituation to the experimental apparatus and the familiar environment. Following 
habituation, mice underwent daily screening trials for light-responsive neurons. If no light-
responsive cells were found, the mouse was allowed to explore the familiar environment for 
5 min and was then unplugged. If one or more recording channels showed a light-responsive 
unit, the mouse was subjected to an ‘exploration’ trial after a 10 min delay (Fig. 2b). The 
mouse might first be placed in the novel environment for 5 min, followed by 25 min in the 
home cage and 5 min in the familiar environment; alternatively, the order of novel and 
familiar exploration was reversed (in a counterbalanced manner). The novelty substrates 
used were the same as the ones used in the event arena tasks. Baseline recording was 
performed between two exploration trials. These particular time delays were chosen in order 
to mimic timing used in the event arena experiments, where there was a 30 min delay 
between memory encoding and novelty exploration. The light-sensitive unit was again 
confirmed in home cage with 1 Hz light stimulation. The microdrive was advanced by ~40 
μm at the end of daily session to ensure that recordings are made from a different population 
of neurons.
Recording and analysis—Recorded spikes were clustered using Klusterkwik 1.5 
unsupervised clustering algorithm (http://klusta-team.github.io/klustakwik/) based on their 
energy and first principal component of the waveform. Clusters were then corrected 
manually using Klusters spike sorting software (http://neurosuite.sourceforge.net/), based on 
several additional parameters (width of waveform, amplitude, time at peak, auto- and cross-
correlograms). Data were analysed using Matlab R2012a (MathWorks). Firing patterns were 
characterised in terms of firing rate, rate of burst events and firing rate of spikes within 
bursts. Bursts were defined, using classic criteria56, as trains of 2 or more spikes with an 
interspike interval of less than 80 ms, followed by an interspike interval of more than 160 
ms. For comparison of novelty modulation in VTA-TH+ and LC-TH+ neurons, firing rates of 
individual neurons in the novel compartment were binned in 10-s bins and normalised to the 
average home cage firing rate of all identified neurons in respective brain areas. For 
additional analysis of the novelty modulation, binned firing rates of individual neurons in the 
novel environment were z-scored to their respective firing rates in the familiar compartment.
Anatomical tract tracing
Under deep pentobarbital anesthesia (100 mg kg−1 of body weight, i.p.), the mice were fixed 
transcardially with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer (PB), pH 7.2, 
post-fixed in the same fixative for 24 h, and placed in 30% sucrose in PB. Sections of fixed

 brains (30 μm in thickness) were prepared using a freezing microtome (SM2000R, Leica 
Microsystems) for immunohistochemistry.
Immunofluorescence—Antibodies used included: goat anti-GFP57, guinea-pig anti-
NET58 and mouse anti-TH (AB152, Millipore). eYFP was visualized by anti-GFP 
immunostaining. All immunohistochemical incubations were done at room temperature. 
Sections were incubated successively with 10% normal donkey serum for 20 min, a mixture 
of primary antibodies overnight (1 μg ml−1), and a mixture of Alexa Fluor 488-, Cy3-, or 
Cy5-labeled species-specific secondary antibodies (Invitrogen; Jackson ImmunoResearch) 
for 2 h at a dilution of 1:200.
Fluorescent in situ hybridization—Brains were freshly obtained under deep diethyl 
ether anaesthesia and immediately frozen in powdered dry ice. Fresh-frozen sections (20 
μm) were cut on a cryostat (CM1900, Leica Microsystems). All sections were mounted on 
silane-coated glass slides. Mouse cDNA fragments of TH (bases 1–1025; GenBank 
accession number, AY855842), and NET (bases 124–814, MMU76306) were subcloned into 
the pBluescript II plasmid vector. Digoxigenin- or fluorescein-labeled cRNA probes were 
transcribed in vitro for fluorescent in situ hybridization59.
Image acquisition and data analysis—Images were taken with a confocal laser-
scanning microscope (FV1200, Olympus) equipped with diode laser lines, and UPlanSApo 
(20×, NA 0.75) and PlanApoN (60×, NA 1.4, oil-immersion) objective lenses (Olympus). To 
avoid cross talk between multiple fluorophores, Alexa Fluor 488, Cy3, and Alexa Fluor 647 
fluorescent signals were acquired sequentially using the 473, 559, and 647 nm excitation 
laser lines, respectively. All images show single optical sections. For quantification of 
anterograde tracing, we obtained images with a 20× objective and then created images of the 
entire hippocampus with a Fluoview image stitching software (Olympus). For analysis, the 
separate colour components were converted to greyscale, and the area of eYFP- and TH-
positive elements were measured with Integrated Morphometry Analysis module 
(MetaMorph software, Molecular Devices).
Ex vivo hippocampal electrophysiology
Hippocampal slice preparation—300 μm thick coronal slices containing the 
hippocampus were cut from Th-Cre transgenic mice52 expressing AAV2 ChR2-eYFP in LC 
(8–12 weeks) in low light conditions to prevent unwanted ChR2 activation. Animals were 
anesthetized under 1.5–2% isoflurane, and the brains removed and blocked following rapid 
decapitation. Hippocampal slices were prepared using a vibratome (VT 1000S, Leica 
Microsystems) in ice cold N-Methyl-d-Glucosamine (NMDG) ringer solution (in mM): 5 
NaCl, 57 NMDG, 37.5 Na-Pyruvate, 12.5 Na-Lactate, 5 Na-Ascorbate, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 
NaH2PO4, 25 NaHCO3, 25 Glucose, 10 MgSO4·7H20, 0.5 CaCl2·2H20, the pH was set 
between 7.3 and 7.4 using 12 N HCl, the osmolarity was adjusted as needed to 315 mOsm 
using glucose and the solution was bubbled with 95% O2 and 5% CO2 gas. Slices were 
maintained in NMDG ringer at room temperature for no longer than 15 min and then 
transferred to artificial cerebral spinal fluid (aCSF) (in mM): 125 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 
NaH2PO4, 1.3 MgCl2, 2 CaCl2, 25 NaHCO3, and 25 dextrose continuously bubbled with

 95% O2 and 5% CO2 gas, where they were kept up to 6 h, protected from light, for 
experimentation. One slice per animal was used.
Ex vivo whole-cell recordings—Slices were transferred to a submersion recording 
chamber and were perfused with aCSF at a rate of 1–2 ml min−1 at 26–29°C. EPSC 
recordings were performed with GABAA receptor antagonist picrotoxin (602.58 g mol−1; 
Sigma-Aldrich) at a concentration of 50 μM and D2 receptor antagonist eticlopride 
(Eticlopride hydrochloride, 377.31 g mol−1; Sigma-Aldrich) at a concentration of 100 nM in 
the bath. A borosilicate glass electrode (3–5 MΩ), pulled with a horizontal pipet puller 
(P-97), was filled with Cs-methanesulfonate pipet solution (in mM): 110 CsMeSO3, 15 
CsCl, 8 NaCl, 2 EGTA, 10 HEPES, 3 QX-314, 2 ATP and 0.3 GTP adjusted to 295 mOsm 
and pH 7.3. Whole-cell pyramidal cell recordings from area CA1 were acquired using a 
combination of visualized and blind patch techniques. Cells were held at −60 mV using a 
multiclamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices). A bipolar stimulating electrode (FHC) was 
placed in the stratum radiatum region of dorsal CA1 within 100–200 μm of the recording 
electrode and stimulation (delivered at a rate of 0.2 Hz) was set to elicit current responses of 
50–150 pA. Data was acquired and analysed automatically using P-Clamp 10 (Molecular 
Devices). Recordings were discarded if the series resistance varied by more than 20% or if 
the initial holding current exceeded 70 pA. Following a 5 min baseline acquisition, 
hippocampal slices were given a 470-nm light stimulus [consisting of three trains delivered 
every 2 min, of sixty 5-ms pulses, applied at 18 Hz (Fig. S7b)] through the 40× objective 
lenses. Following the light stimulus, baseline stimulation resumed.
Ex vivo field recordings—Slices were transferred to a submersion chamber and were 
perfused with aCSF at a rate of ~2 ml min−1 at 29–31°C. Field recordings from the stratum 
radiatum of dorsal CA1 were acquired using a borosilicate glass electrode (1–3 MΩ) filled 
with aCSF. A bipolar stimulating electrode was also placed in the stratum radiatum of CA1 
within 100–200 μm of the recording electrode and stimulation (one stimulus every 30 s) was 
set to elicit a fEPSP slope that was ~50% of the maximum value. A stable 15 min baseline 
was obtained, followed by 10 more min of baseline stimulation with or without simultaneous 
optogenetic stimulation of LC-TH+ axons. Photostimulation consisting of four trains, at a 1 s 
interval, consisting of four 10-ms pulses of 470-nm light at 16 Hz, delivered every 30 s for 
the duration of 10 min (Fig. S7c), were applied through the 10× objective (directly before 
the Schaffer collateral stimulus). After the 25 min baseline, a weak theta-burst tetanus was 
applied consisting of four trains, at a 100 ms interval, consisting of 3 pulses at 50 Hz (12 
pulses in total). Baseline stimulation then resumed as described above for 45 min. Every 2 
traces were averaged to reduce variability. Data was acquired and analysed automatically 
using P-Clamp 10.
Ex vivo pharmacology—Where indicated, the following drugs were bath applied: α-
adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin (prazosin hydrochloride, 419.86 g mol−1; Sigma-Aldrich) 
at a concentration of 30 μM, β-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol [(S)-(−)-propranolol 
hydrochloride, 295.80 g mol−1; Sigma-Aldrich] at a concentration of 30 μM, D1/D5 receptor 
antagonist SCH 39166 (SCH 39166 hydrochloride, 394.73 g mol−1; Tocris) at a 
concentration of 100 nM (intracellular recordings, n = 2), and D1/D5 receptor antagonist

 SCH 23390 (SCH 23390 hydrochloride, 324.24 g mol−1; Tocris) at a concentration of 100 
nM (intracellular recordings, n = 3) or 1 μM (extracellular recordings).
Acute extracellular recordings in anaesthetised mice
Anaesthesia was induced using isoflurane for LC optrode recording as described above or 
4.8% chloral hydrate for VTA recording (induction: 480 mg kg−1 body weight, i.p.; 
maintenance: 120 mg kg−1 body weight, i.p.). Recordings were made using a 125 µm 1 MΩ 
tungsten electrode (A-M systems). This electrode was connected to a differential AC 
amplifier (A-M Systems), signals were band-pass filtered at 300 Hz-5 kHz, amplified 10 K 
times and digitized at 20 kHz. Spiking activity was defined as spikes that exceed 5 standard 
deviations from the mean value of the baseline signal [1 min before laser stimulation (LC) or 
drug infusion (VTA)]. Multi-unit activity in each trace was then normalised to the pre-
stimulation (LC) or pre-infusion (VTA) baseline.
LC optrode recording—The tungsten electrode was coupled to an optic fibre (0.22 NA, 
200 μm core diameter) (an ‘optrode’). This optrode was positioned above LC (AP, −5.45 
mm; ML, 1.00 mm; and DV, −2.80 mm), and was then gradually in lowered in 50 μm 
increments until multi-unit activity was observed. Laser stimulation was performed using a 
green solid-state diode pumped laser (532 nm, Laser 2000) with 10–20 mW output from the 
fiber. For quantification of eArch3.0 recordings, baseline was measured over 30 s before the 
start of illumination (Pre), level of inhibition was measured over 5 min light on period (LC-
ON), rebound activity was measured over 1 min after the end of illumination (Rebound), 
post-inhibition baseline was measured 4–5 min after the end of illumination (Post).
VTA recording with pharmacology—The drug cannula (33 gauge, Plastics One) was 
positioned in the VTA at 14° angle to sagittal plane (AP, −3.52 mm; ML, 0.48 mm; and DV, 
−4.40 mm) and the recording electrode was positioned vertically at the boundary of the 
VTA. For intra-VTA microinjection of lidocaine, infusion parameters were the same as those 
used in the behavioural experiment as described above. For quantification, pre-infusion 
baseline was measured over 30 s before the start of infusion (Pre), level of inhibition was 
measured 3–8 min after the start of infusion (Lid) – the period that corresponds to novelty 
exploration, and post-inhibition baseline was measured 17–18 min after the start of injection 
(Post).
Statistics, data presentation and data deposition
Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 19 (IBM). All data are expressed as 
mean ± s.e.m. Statistical significance was always determined by ANOVAs, prior to 
orthogonal comparisons where possible or Tukey HSD tests as appropriate to correct for 
multiple comparisons, paired t-tests and one-sample t-tests. All statistical tests were two-
tailed. Analysis of probe test performance was done on the basis on the ‘% correct dig time’ 
score. In the pharmacological inactivation experiment (Fig. 6), three animals that 
persistently failed to show any novelty-induced memory enhancement in all control 
conditions [all 24-h PT scores (% correct dig) in the ‘novelty with vehicle’ condition at 
below chance level, i.e. < 20%] were eliminated from the whole dataset prior to statistical 
analysis (leaving n = 15). The rationale was that it is not possible to measure the impact of

 Figure 5. Optogenetic activation of LC-TH+ axons enhances hippocampal synaptic function
a, Hippocampal slice physiology. Orange line=hippocampal slice plane. b, Left, potentiation 
of Schaffer collateral (SC)-evoked EPSCs from CA1 pyramidal neurons after strong 
optogenetic activation (blue) of hippocampal LC-TH+ axons (Light-ON, n=5) is unaffected 
by adrenoceptor antagonists (Light-ON with Praz/Prop, n=4) but blocked by D1/D5 receptor 
antagonist (Light-ON with SCH, n=5) (Conditions×Time interaction, F7.8, 42.8=2.50, P<0.05, 
Greenhouse-Geisser correction). Middle, exemplar EPSCs from CA1 pyramidal neurons. 
Dashed lines=baseline EPSCs; Continuous=EPSCs 30–35 min after the optogenetic

showing effect of D1/D5 receptor antagonist (SCH) but no effect of adrenoceptor antagonists 
(Praz/Prop) (F2,11=6.38, P<0.05). c, Left, fEPSP responses to weak theta-burst stimulation 
(arrow) with or without optogenetic activation of hippocampal LC-TH+ axons (blue). No 
synaptic potentiation without theta-burst [Light-ON (no LTP), n=6], but with it, an increase 
in synaptic strength lasting > 45 min (Light-OFF + LTP, n=6) that was significantly 
enhanced by a weak physiologically relevant optogenetic stimulation of LC-TH+ axons 
(Light-ON + LTP, n=11). SCH blocked optogenetic enhancement of LTP (Light-ON + LTP
