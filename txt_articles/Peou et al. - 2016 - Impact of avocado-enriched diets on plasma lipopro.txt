Meta-analysis
BACKGROUND: Optimizing plasma lipoproteins is the primary goal of pharmacotherapy and diet
interventions in people at risk for cardiovascular diseases. Avocados offer a rich source of monounsat-
urated fat and may pose beneficial effects on the lipid profile.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to perform a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials assessing the
impact of avocados on TC, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein
cholesterol, and/or triglycerides (TG).
METHODS: We searched PUBMED, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature,
Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and the Cochrane Database of Systemic Reviews
from their inception to February 2015. The weighted mean difference from baseline was calculated
for all endpoints. Subgroup analyses were performed to assess heterogeneity, and funnel plots in-
spected to assess publication bias.
RESULTS: Ten unique studies (n 5 229) were included. Avocado consumption significantly reduced
TC, LDL-C, and TG by 218.80 mg/dL (95% confidence interval [CI], 224.56 to 213.05; I2, 46.9%),
216.50 mg/dL (95% CI, 222.91 to 210.10; I2, 72.5%), 227.20 mg/dL (95% CI, 244.41 to 29.99;
I2, 91.1%) respectively. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased nonsignificantly by 20.18 mg/
dL (95% CI, 23.23 to 2.88; I2, 84.8%).
CONCLUSION: Avocado-substituted diets significantly decrease TC, LDL-C, and TG levels. Substitut-
ing dietary fats with avocados versus adding to the free diet should be the primary recommendation strat-
egy. Larger trials looking at the impact of avocados on major adverse cardiovascular events are warranted.

Introduction
Over 15 million Americans are currently diagnosed with
coronary heart disease (CHD), the most common prevent-
able cause of death. In 2010 alone, 545,059 deaths were
attributed to CHD, with approximately one American dying
every minute and 23 seconds.1 The link between serum
cholesterol and cardiovascular mortality has been well es-
tablished.2 The preponderance of evidence suggests that
having high levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol
(LDL-C) is a positive indicator of CHD development. Re-
ductions of LDL-C have been shown to reduce mortality
and efforts to reduce LDL-C have been the main target of
most
lipid-lowering
medications.
In
contrast,
having
elevated levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol

 (HDL-C) is considered protective against CHD develop-
ment.3–5 Triglyceride (TG) lowering is also an important
factor for reducing the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascu-
lar disease.6 Dietary sources can play a major role toward
a beneficiary or unfavorable lipid profile.7
Fatty acids in foods typically fall within one of the four
categories: saturated fats (SFAs), common in animal
sources, trans fats (TFAs), common in processed foods,
polyunsaturated fats (PUFAs), and monounsaturated fats
(MUFAs),
both
common
in
plant-derived
sources.8
Although low-fat diets are generally recommended, studies
have indicated that altering the types of fats you consume
may further modify the risk of dyslipidemia. Favorable
lipid profiles were seen when consumption of SFAs and
TFAs were decreased and replaced by PUFAs and/or MU-
FAs.2,9 Hu et al. demonstrated an estimated risk reduction
of 19% in CHD when the consumption of MUFAs was
increased by 5%.10 Moreno et al. found that a diet rich in
MUFAs may have favorable effects on cardiovascular risk
by preventing the oxidative modifications of LDL-C, an
early event in atherosclerosis.11 Currently, the Dietary
Guidelines for Americans recommend a total fat intake of
20% to 35% of calories for people over the age of 18 years.
The guideline promotes consuming less than 7% of calories
from SFAs and replacing them with PUFAs and/or MUFAs
to reduce blood cholesterol levels and lower the risk of car-
diovascular disease.8 The American Heart Association/
American College of Cardiology Guideline on Lifestyle
Management to Reduce Cardiovascular Risk recommends
a reduction of SFA intake of 5% to 6% of calories.2 Both
guidelines are in agreement in reducing the amount of
SFAs consumed and replacing them with PUFAs and/or
MUFAs.
Avocados (Persea Americana) are rich in MUFAs.12 The
most common type of avocado cultivated in the United
States is the Hass avocado. The average Hass avocado pro-
vides 136 g of edible fruit whose oil consists of 71% MU-
FAs, 13% PUFAs, and 16% SFAs.12 There are additional
constituents of the fruit including fiber, B-vitamins and vi-
tamins K1 and E, magnesium and potassium, and phyto-
chemicals
such
as
carotenoids,
phenolics,
and
phytosterols, which may also contribute to other positive
health effects.12
The Mediterranean diet has shown to improve lipid
profiles and decrease the risk of CHD.13–15 Although the
amount of calories from fat in this diet exceeds the standard
recommendations, presumably because of the ‘‘healthier’’
nature of the MUFAs found in olive oil and nuts, mitigating
the progression of dyslipidemia. Primary prevention of car-
diovascular disease with a Mediterranean diet, a multi-
center trial conducted in Spain that randomized patients
to a Mediterranean diet consisting of either extra-virgin
olive oil (1 liter weekly), mixed nuts (15 g of walnuts,
7.5 g of hazelnuts, and 7.5 g of almonds) or a control
diet, showed that among subjects at high risk of cardiovas-
cular events, extra-virgin olive oil or nuts reduced the risk
of
cardiovascular
events
by
approximately
30%.16
Avocados may provide a similar benefit. The purpose of
this meta-analysis is to examine the use of avocados as
an additive or substitute for other sources of dietary fats
and the subsequent effect on TC, LDL-C, HDL-C, and
TG levels.
Methods
Search strategy and selection criteria
A literature search was performed using the term
‘‘avocado’’ and ‘‘Persea Americana’’ limited to clinical
trials conducted in human subjects. Three independent
reviewers (S.P., B.M., S.S.) performed a literature search
using PubMed (1966 to February 21, 2015), Cumulative In-
dex to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (1982 to
February 21, 2015), and Cochrane Database of Systemic
Reviews (2005 to February 21, 2015). References of rele-
vant primary articles and review articles were hand
searched.
An initial screen of all abstracts was conducted followed
by a thorough review of full-text publications of trials
meeting the following inclusion criteria: randomized,
clinical
trials,
human
subjects,
and
trials
evaluating
avocado in the diet with reported measures of TC, LDL-
C, HDL-C, and/or TG.
Studies were excluded if the intervention was less than
5 days duration or if a pill form of avocado extracts was
used. In instances where data were only extractable by
estimation of figures, the study was excluded.
The primary outcomes of interest were the mean change
in TC, LDL-C, HDL-C, and TG from baseline.
Validity assessment
The following methodologic features to control bias
were assessed: randomization, blinding, and withdrawals
and/or dropouts. Jadad scores were calculated to aid in the
identification of reports with overall weaker study meth-
odologies. The maximum quality score was a total of 5
points with zero being the lowest possible score.17
Data abstraction
All data were extracted by three independent investiga-
tors (S.P., B.M., S.S.) through the use of a standardized data
abstraction tool. Any discrepancy was resolved upon dis-
cussion. The following information was retrieved from each
article: author identification, year of publication, study size,
health status of the patient population (healthy, overweight,
patients with dyslipidemia and/or diabetes), type of avo-
cado, avocado dose, source of supplementary MUFA,
avocado substituted for dietary fat vs avocado added onto
baseline diet, duration of avocado diet, geographical
location of the study, and study design (parallel or
crossover). Pretreatment values for TC, LDL-C, HDL-C,
162

 and TG were taken from the baseline entry values in all
studies.18–27 When multiple usable comparator arms were
available within an individual study, the data was counted
as another study in the meta-analysis model.20,25,26
When necessary, standard error (SE) was converted to
standard deviation (SD) using the equation standard error 5
standard deviation/(sample size1/2).28 Sample size was ex-
tracted based on actual number of subjects used in the final
analysis. In trials reporting standard error (SE) and mean
change in a parameter of interest, 95% confidence intervals
(CIs)
were
calculated
using
the
equations
95%
CI 5 mean 6 (SE ! 1.96).28 Conversions of TC, LDL-
C, HDL-C units from mmol/L to mg/dL (United States
standard) were performed by multiplying mmol/L by 38.7
and TG units from mmol/L to mg/dL by multiplying by
88.29
Statistical analysis
The variables analyzed included serum lipid levels of
TC, LDL-C, HDL-C, and TG. Each variable was reported
as a weighted mean difference with a 95% CI using a
DerSimonian and Laird random-effects model. Statistical
heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistic. All statis-
tical analyses were done using StatsDirect, version 2.8.0
software (StatsDirect Ltd, Cheshire, UK).
Subgroup analyses were performed to assess sources of
clinical heterogeneity. Subgroups included, all studies
(fixed-effects), studies with a Jadad score $3, health status
(subjects that were healthy, overweight, having dyslipide-
mia and/or diabetes), avocado as the only MUFA source,
avocado in addition to other dietary MUFA sources (olive
oil and/or almonds), Hass type avocados, duration of
intervention (, or $4 weeks), and avocado as an addition
to a free diet. Publication bias was assessed using the
Egger-weighted regression statistic and visual inspection of
funnel plots.

Meta-analyses outcomes
Avocado consumption significantly reduced TC, LDL-C,
and TG by 218.80 mg/dL (95% CI, 224.56 to 213.05; I2,
46.9%), 216.50 mg/dL (95% CI, 222.91 to 210.10; I2,
72.5%), 227.20 mg/dL (95% CI, 244.41 to 29.99; I2,
91.1%), respectively (Fig 2A, B, D). HDL-C decreased
nonsignificantly by 20.18 mg/dL (95% CI, 23.23 to
2.88; I2, 84.8%; Fig 2C).
Egger bias statistics showed lack of publication bias for
all endpoints (P $ 0.471), except for TG (P 5 0.021),
confirmed by funnel plot inspection (Fig 3A–D).
Subgroup analyses
Table 2 depicts the results of subgroup analyses per-
formed.
LDL-C
reduction remained
significant when
limited to a fixed-effects model. This was also true when
analyses were limited to only studies that had Jadad scores
$3, healthy subjects, subjects with dyslipidemia, avocados
as the only MUFA source, avocado in addition to other
MUFA
sources,
Hass
avocados
only,
interventions
,4 weeks, and interventions $4 weeks. However, LDL-C
reduction was nonsignificant in overweight subjects, sub-
jects who had diabetes with or without dyslipidemia and
lastly avocados added to a free diet.
TC was significantly reduced when limited to a fixed-
effects model. Significant reductions were also seen in
analyses that were limited to only studies that had Jadad
scores $3, healthy subjects, subjects with dyslipidemia,
avocados as the only MUFA source, avocado in addition to
other MUFA sources, Hass avocados only, interventions
,4 weeks, and interventions $4 weeks. However, TC
reduction was nonsignificant in overweight subjects, sub-
jects who had diabetes with or without dyslipidemia, and
finally, avocados added to a free diet.
HDL-C levels decreased significantly when analysis
was limited to healthy subjects and to studies that had
avocados added to a free diet. It was decreased nonsignif-
icantly in analyses that were limited to fixed effects, Jadad
scores $3, overweight subjects, avocado as sole MUFA
source,
studies
that
involved
Hass
avocados
only,
interventions ,4 weeks and interventions $4 weeks.
Increases in HDL-C levels were nonsignificantly seen in
subjects with dyslipidemia, subjects with diabetes with or
without dyslipidemia and avocados in addition to other
MUFA sources.
TG reduction was significantly seen in the fixed-effects
analysis and in subgroup analyses that involved studies
only including healthy subjects, subjects with diabetes with
or without dyslipidemia, avocados with other MUFA
sources and in studies with interventions $4 weeks. It
was nonsignificantly reduced in studies with overweight
subjects, subjects with dyslipidemia, avocados as the sole
MUFA source, Hass avocados only, interventions less than
4 weeks and avocados added to a free diet.
Discussion
In our meta-analysis, incorporating 10 unique studies
and 229 participants, using an avocado (MUFA rich)
substituted diet significantly lowered TC, LDL-C, and TG
levels with no impact on HDL-C. The magnitude of benefit
with substituting avocados for mostly saturated dietary fats
is noteworthy as red yeast rice, a commonly used supple-
ment, which typically lowers TC by 13% and LDL-C by
19%.30 Pharmaceutical agents such as Ezetimibe reduce
TC, LDL-C, and TG by 13%, 18%, and 8% respectively
and maximum dose Niacin lowers TC by 10%, LDL-C
by 14%, and TG by 28%.31,32 The least potent statin on
the market, lovastatin, at a dose of 20 mg daily, decreases
TC by 17%, LDL-C by 24%, and TG by 10%.33 Omega-
3 fatty acids have shown to be highly beneficial for
lowering TG but at times with a consequential increase in
LDL-C.34 In comparison, the degree of lipid profile
changes with avocado substitution in the diet appears to
be clinically meaningful.
There are several mechanisms with which pharmaco-
logic agents and dietary supplements exert their lipid-
profile
effects.
Red
yeast
rice
and
statins
inhibit
hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, the rate-
limiting step in the synthesis of cholesterol.35,36 Ezetimibe
acts at the brush border of the small intestines and inhibits
the uptake of both dietary and biliary cholesterol via the
sterol transporter, Niemann-Pick C1-Like1 (NPC1L1),
keeping cholesterol in the intestinal lumen for excretion.37

167
 degradation of hepatic apo-B particles and decreased secre-
tion of very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C)
and LDL particles.38 It is proposed that avocados reduce
lipid levels by enhancing the breakdown of TG-rich lipo-
proteins and inhibiting VLDL-C secretion from the liver,
resulting in a decrease of circulating LDL-C.39
Interestingly, our results indicate that even healthy
subjects with a relatively normal baseline TC (100 to
240 mg/dL), LDL-C (75 to 150 mg/dL), and TG (50 to
175 mg/dL) had significant reductions. In this group, HDL-
C reduced significantly but the reduction is most likely not
clinically significant. The subgroups of patients with
dyslipidemia had the greatest reduction in TC and LDL-
C. Conversely, overweight subjects and those with diabetes
did not have significant reductions in their lipid profiles.
The small sample sizes in these subgroups may not entirely
explain the lack of benefit. Obese patients seem to have
high VLDL concentrations leading to increased conversion
of VLDL to LDL-C. Hence, reducing saturated fat intake
may not be enough to compensate for the overproduction of
LDL-C.40 Another possibility is that insulin resistance or
increased insulin concentrations lead to metabolic changes
in the liver that may result in decreased LDL-C receptor
responsiveness to dietary changes.41
Although our analysis showed beneficial effects even in
healthy subjects, it is important to note that substituting
avocados for saturated dietary fats as opposed to adding
avocado to an already established baseline diet poses the
greatest benefit. Although only two studies were available
for inclusion, adding avocado to an already established
baseline diet conferred no benefits to the lipid profile. As
such, health policy and public health recommendations
with generic statements of eating more avocados should
emphasize avocado substitution over addition to free
diet.2,8
Specific types of nuts are also a good source of MUFA.
In a pooled analysis of 25 studies that looked at a variety of
nuts (almonds, walnuts, pistachios, peanuts, and macadam-
ias), a mean LDL-C reduction of 7.4% was evident. These
results were not found for patients with obesity and/or
metabolic syndrome.42 In a study that observed almond
consumption in subjects with type 2 diabetes, an 11.6%
decrease in LDL-C was seen.43 LDL-C levels in patients
with
moderate
dyslipidemia
in
another
study
were
decreased by 10.8% and 14% with almond and walnut
consumption, respectively.44 These nuts were either incor-
porated into an existing diet or substituted one. However,
most of the studies had small sample sizes and extrapola-
tion to the general population needs further exploration.43,44
Based on our meta-analysis, avocados have a greater LDL-
C reduction in subjects with dyslipidemia but this needs
further evaluation in a head-to-head trial.

Avocado and lipid-lowering effects
169
 There are over 60 avocado varieties available in the
United States, 56 of the varieties are grown in Florida and 7
types grown in California.45 About 90% of the avocados
consumed in the United States and most worldwide are of
the Haas variety.46 Most studies included in our analyses
used the Haas avocado allowing for easy extrapolation of
our results to American dietary patterns. However, the au-
thors have no reason to suspect that the benefits may not
extend to the other varieties of avocados.
There are several limitations to this meta-analysis
worthy of mention. The possibility of the beneficial effects
on the lipid profile with avocado consumption to be driven
partly by weight loss cannot be ruled out. In one of the
included studies, an energy-restricted diet and avocado-
substituted high MUFA diet had similar weight loss and
lipid parameter changes.18 Six of the 10 studies measured
weight before and after an avocado-enriched dietary inter-
vention over 2 to 6 weeks.18,19,21,23,24 Body weight
decreased in all 6 studies but was statistically significant
in only 3 of them.18,23,24 A reduction in weight of about
5% to 10% has been shown to decrease LDL-C by
10 mg/dL, TG by 40 mg/dL and increasing HDL-C by
5 mg/dL.47,48
Although the overall analysis effectively evaluated the
use of avocados in improving lipid profiles, the subgroup
analyses by health status or baseline diet are difficult to
assess due to the small sample size in each subgroup.
Although the primary strategy should be of dietary fat
substitution from a MUFA rich source, it is possible that
adding free avocados may also have health benefits inde-
pendent of their lipid profile. The amount of avocado-
consumed varied between studies and ranged from 0.5 to
1.5 avocados or 136 g to 300 g of avocado per day. Three of
the studies actually calculated the avocado amount based
on individual caloric needs. In these three studies, subjects
were given the recommended 30% total fat diet, where the
avocado accounted for 75% of the calories (22.5% of total
caloric intake came from avocado). It is unknown as to
what specific ‘‘dose’’ of avocado consumption is needed per
day to sustain lipid-lowering effects. Most studies scored
poorly using the Jadad scale; the complexity of an avocado
makes it difficult to appropriately blind an intervention as
such. Three of the studies evaluated the lipid profile within
less than 4 weeks. Seeing the study duration related
differences in our results, future lipid studies should ideally
have a minimum duration of 4 weeks.20,23,24 Finally, we did
not evaluate other endpoints such as weight, body mass in-
dex, LDL-C particle size, or LDL-C subclass, which would
have further bolstered our findings if adequate data were
available.
Conclusion
Avocado-substituted diets significantly decrease TC,
LDL-C, and TG levels in healthy adults with a normal
body mass index. Substituting dietary fats; specifically
saturated fats, with avocados versus adding to the free diet
should be the public health recommendation strategy. The
optimal amount of avocado and frequency of use needs
further evaluation along with the nutritional similarities and
differences between other different MUFA sources. Larger
trials looking at the impact of avocados on major adverse
cardiovascular events are warranted.
