Higher brain BDNF gene expression is
associated with slower cognitive decline in
older adults
ABSTRACT
Objectives: We tested whether brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene expression levels
are associated with cognitive decline in older adults.
Methods: Five hundred thirty-five older participants underwent annual cognitive assessments and
brain autopsy at death. BDNF gene expression was measured in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.
Linear mixed models were used to examine whether BDNF expression was associated with cognitive
decline adjusting for age, sex, and education. An interaction term was added to determine whether
this association varied with clinical diagnosis proximate to death (no cognitive impairment, mild
cognitive impairment, or dementia). Finally, we examined the extent to which the association of
Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology with cognitive decline varied by BDNF expression.
Results: Higher brain BDNF expression was associated with slower cognitive decline (p , 0.001);
cognitive decline was about 50% slower with the 90th percentile BDNF expression vs 10th. This
association was strongest in individuals with dementia. The level of BDNF expression was lower in
individuals with pathologic AD (p 5 0.006), but was not associated with macroscopic infarcts,
Lewy body disease, or hippocampal sclerosis. BDNF expression remained associated with cog-
nitive decline in a model adjusting for age, sex, education, and neuropathologies (p , 0.001).
Furthermore, the effect of AD pathology on cognitive decline varied by BDNF expression such
that the effect was strongest for high levels of AD pathology (p 5 0.015); thus, in individuals with
high AD pathology (90th percentile), cognitive decline was about 40% slower with the 90th
percentile BDNF expression vs 10th.
Conclusions: Higher brain BDNF expression is associated with slower cognitive decline and may
also
reduce
the
deleterious
effects
of
AD pathology on
cognitive decline.

Developing treatments for cognitive decline is a major public health priority in our aging popula-
tion. While considerable progress has been made in elucidating the complex relationship between
age-related neuropathology and resilience factors that affect the rate of cognitive decline, there are
no treatments that slow or prevent cognitive decline in older adults. Converging preclinical and
human studies suggest that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) may influence late-life cog-
nitive impairment.1,2 Moreover, BDNF may mitigate the deleterious effects of Alzheimer disease
(AD) pathology in the brains of older adults and have a role in the pathogenesis of AD.3 Moreover,
these reports led to studies that found that low serum or plasma BDNF levels may predict more
rapid cognitive decline and may be lower in AD.1,4 However, we are not aware of studies that have
examined the association of brain BDNF gene expression with the rate of cognitive decline.

 We used data from more than 500 older
persons participating in 2 community-based
cohort studies that include autopsy at death,
to the test the hypothesis that brain BDNF
gene expression is associated with the rate of
cognitive decline during life.5,6 The rate of
cognitive decline over an average of 6 years
was derived from a structured annual cognitive
assessment, brain BDNF gene expression was
obtained from the dorsal lateral prefrontal cor-
tex (DLPFC), and neuropathology indices
were obtained from structured brain autopsy.
First, we tested whether BDNF gene expres-
sion levels were associated with the rate of cog-
nitive decline and whether this association
varied by clinical diagnosis proximate to death.
Then we examined whether this association
was attenuated when we adjusted for the pres-
ence of common age-related neuropathologies.
Finally, we determined whether the relation of
AD pathology with the rate of cognitive
decline varied by BDNF expression.
METHODS Participants. Data came from 2 longitudinal
clinical autopsy studies, the Religious Orders Study and the Rush
Memory and Aging Project.5,6 Next-generation RNA-seq data
were generated in 2012 and 541 datasets passed quality control
and 6 cases with incomplete neuropathology measures were
excluded.
Cognitive function and clinical diagnoses. Each year,
trained technicians administered 19 cognitive tests; 17 tests were
used to generate a composite measure of global cognition as pre-
viously described (appendix e-1 on the Neurology® Web site at
Neurology.org).5,6 Age in years was computed from self-report
date of birth and date of death. Sex and education were
recorded at the baseline interview. After death of a patient, a
neurologist who was blinded to autopsy data reviewed all
available cognitive and clinical data to assign a clinical
diagnosis. Dementia and its causes were determined using the
guidelines of the joint working group of the National Institute
of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and
Alzheimer’s
Disease
and
Related
Disorders
Association.7
Individuals with cognitive impairment who did not meet
dementia
criteria
were
diagnosed
with
mild
cognitive
impairment (MCI).8 Individuals without dementia or MCI
were classified as having no cognitive impairment (NCI).9
Postmortem brain indices. Brain removal, tissue sectioning
and preservation, and a uniform examination with quantification
of postmortem indices followed a standard protocol.5,6 Postmortem
measures included the presence of pathologic AD based on National
Institute on Aging criteria, a continuous measure summarizing the
burden of AD pathology, as well as amyloid load and tangles. In
addition, the presence of chronic macroscopic infarcts, Lewy body
disease (LBD) pathology, and hippocampal sclerosis were recorded.
These measures are described more fully in appendix e-1.
Brain BDNF gene expression. RNA was extracted from post-
mortem tissue from the gray matter of DLPFC using Qiagen’s
miRNeasy Mini Kit (cat. no. 217004, Valencia, CA) and the
RNase-Free DNase Set (cat. no. 79254). RNA was quantified
using Nanodrop following a quality checking using RNA
integrity scores as previously described.10 RNA-seq library was
prepared on the Broad Institute’s Genomics Platform and the
sequencing was performed on
the Illumina HiSeq with
coverage of at least 75 M 101-bp paired-end reads. The
fragments per kilobase per million (FPKM) for each gene were
quantified using RSEM software with Bowtie alignment. The
FPKM were quantile-normalized with batch effects removed
using
combat.11–13
These
normalized
values
estimate
the
expression level for each gene where higher values correspond
to higher levels of expression. BDNF expression values were
right-skewed and a base-2 logarithm transformation was applied
before the analysis.
BDNF Val66Met polymorphism. DNA was extracted and
genotyped as previously reported.14 Briefly, standard quality control
measures, implemented in PLINK, were applied at both sample
and polymorphism levels. Population outliers were identified and
removed using EIGENSTRAT. Genotype imputation was per-
formed using BEAGLE with the 1000 Genomes Project (2011
Phase 1b data freeze) as the reference panel. We focused our analysis
on the Val66Met polymorphism (rs6265), which has been linked

 in some studies to incident AD and cognitive decline.15 Dosage
values of the polymorphism were extracted from the genome-wide
imputed data. The dosage, coded with respect to the T allele (allele
frequency 0.19) in our data, ranges from 0 to 2.
Statistical analysis. The t tests were used to examine the dif-
ference of brain BDNF expression by presence of common neu-
ropathologic conditions. Linear mixed models with both random
intercept and random slope were used to examine the association
of brain BDNF expression with annual rate of change in cognitive
function. In these models, the repeated cognitive measures col-
lected multiple years before death were the longitudinal outcome,
and BDNF expression was the primary predictor. The slope, esti-
mated by a term for time in years before death, measures the
average annual rate of change in cognition. The interaction
between time and BDNF expression estimates the association of
the BDNF expression with rate of change in cognition. A signif-
icant and positive coefficient for the interaction suggests that a
higher level of BDNF expression is associated with slower cogni-
tive decline. The random intercept captures person-specific
variations from the mean level of cognition proximate to death,
and the random slope captures person-specific variations from the
mean rate of cognitive decline. The random effects follow a
bivariate normal distribution with an unstructured 2 3 2
covariance matrix, and the residual error follows a univariate
normal distribution. The model was adjusted for age, sex, and
education. Next, we augmented the prior model with a 3-way
interaction term to examine whether BDNF expression modified
the association of clinical diagnosis with cognitive decline.
Pearson correlations assessed the unadjusted association of
BDNF expression with continuous measures of global AD pathol-
ogy. Multivariable linear regression models were performed with
BDNF expression as the outcome and neuropathologic indices as
the predictors, adjusted for age, sex, and education. Next, we
added terms to adjust for 4 neuropathologies to the linear mixed
model described above. Then, we augmented the prior model
with a 3-way interaction term to examine whether BDNF expres-
sion modified the association of AD pathology with cognitive
decline. All of the analyses were conducted using SAS/STAT
software, version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC)16 and statis-
tical packages in R version 3.1.2 (www.r-project.org). We applied
a nominal threshold of p , 0.05 for statistical significance.
Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient
consents. The study was approved by the institutional review
board of Rush University Medical Center. Written informed con-
sent and an anatomical gift act for brain donation at the time of
death was obtained from all study participants.
RESULTS There were 535 cases included in these
analyses, and their clinical characteristics and autopsy
findings are summarized in table 1.
BDNF brain expression and cognitive decline. BDNF
expression was detected in all postmortem brains.
During up to 16 years of follow-up (mean 6.3
years, SD 5 3.9 years), on average, cognition
declined by about 0.10 U/y. Using a linear mixed-
effect model, we examined the association of the level
of BDNF expression with the rate of change in
cognition. In a model adjusted for demographics, a
higher level of BDNF expression was associated with a
slower rate of cognitive decline (table 2). Figure 1

 illustrates the differences in trajectories of cognitive
decline between persons with low (10th percentile),
median (50th percentile), and high (90th percentile)
level of the BDNF gene expression. Thus, the rate of
cognitive decline was reduced by about half (48.3%)
in persons with the 90th percentile of BDNF
expression vs 10th percentile.
The rate of cognitive decline varies with clinical
diagnosis and is most rapid in dementia.17 Next, we
added a 3-way interaction term that showed that
BDNF expression modified the association of clinical
diagnosis and the rate of cognitive decline (rate of
cognitive decline 3 BDNF expression 3 clinical diag-
nosis [estimate 5 0.013, SE 5 0.004, p 5 0.002]).
Figure e-1 illustrates that the cognitive slowing
associated with higher BDNF expression was most
striking for dementia (blue dotted line vs red dotted
line). Consistent with this figure, stratified analyses
showed that the effect of higher BDNF expression was
strongest in individuals with dementia (estimate 5
0.013, SE 5 0.004, p 5 0.003), weakly significant
in MCI (estimate 5 0.008, SE 5 0.004, p 5 0.045),
and not significant in NCI (estimate 5 0.0004, SE 5
0.003, p 5 0.907).
Global cognition comprises measures of 5 related
but relatively dissociable cognitive systems. In further
analyses, brain BDNF expression levels were associ-
ated with the rate of decline of all 5 cognitive abilities
(table 2).
BDNF brain expression and brain pathology. In a linear
regression model adjusted for age, sex, and education,
BDNF expression was associated with pathologic AD
(estimate 5 20.295, SE 5 0.10, p 5 0.006) but not
with macroscopic infarcts, LBD, or hippocampal scle-
rosis (table e-1). Next, we replaced binary pathologic
AD with a continuous measure of global AD, which
was also significantly inversely correlated with BDNF
expression (estimate 5 20.531, SE 5 0.131, p ,
0.001) such that brains with more AD pathology had
a lower expression level (table e-1).
In further analyses, we replaced AD pathology
with amyloid load or tangles. We found that amyloid
load and tangles measured in 8 different cortical re-
gions were all inversely associated with BDNF expres-
sion levels measured in the DLPFC (table e-2).

in table 2 by including terms for 4 pathologic indices

AD, LBD, and hippocampal sclerosis pathologies
were also associated with a faster rate of cognitive
decline, but not macroscopic infarcts (table 3). In this
model, demographics accounted for 3.3% of the var-
iance of cognitive decline, common neuropathologies
accounted for 26.8%, and BDNF accounted for an
additional 2.1%. Similar results were obtained when
we included a term for amyloid load or tangles instead

 of a summary measure for AD pathology (results not
shown).
Next, we added a 3-way interaction term to the
previous model (table 3) to determine whether BDNF
expression modified the association of AD pathology
with cognitive decline. Higher BDNF expression
reduced the effect of AD pathology on the rate of
cognitive decline (estimate 5 0.023, SE 5 0.009,
p 5 0.015).
Figure 2 illustrates that the cognitive slowing asso-
ciated with higher BDNF expression was most strik-
ing for individuals with the highest levels of AD
pathology (90th percentile). Thus, for 2 individuals
with high AD pathology, cognitive decline was 40%
slower in an individual with 90th percentile BDNF
expression (blue dotted line) vs 10th percentile (red
dotted line).
BDNF brain expression, Val66Met, brain pathology, and
cognitive decline. Polymorphism of the BDNF gene,
Val66Met (rs6265), may influence cognition in old
age.18 Therefore, we examined the relationship of
Val66Met (rs6265) with BDNF expression levels.
Of the subset of 503 cases that had genotype data,
332 (66.0%) had 0 copy of the T allele, 154 (30.6%)
had 1 copy, and 17 (3.4%) had 2 copies.
Analysis of variance shows that the BDNF expres-
sion level did not differ by the genotype (p 5 0.804).
In a linear regression model adjusted for age, sex, and
education, we did not find an association of Val66Met
with brain BDNF expression (estimate 5 20.062,
SE 5 0.092, p 5 0.498). Separately, in a linear mixed
model adjusted for demographics, we did not find evi-
dence of an association of the polymorphism with the
rate of cognitive decline (estimate 5 0.008, SE 5
0.010, p 5 0.405). Both results were unchanged when
we adjusted for neuropathologies.
DISCUSSION In more than 500 older adults, a high-
er level of brain BDNF expression was associated with
a slower rate of cognitive decline across a wide range
of cognitive abilities during an average of 6 years
before death. This association was strongest in indi-
viduals diagnosed with dementia proximate to death
compared to those with MCI or NCI. While brain
BDNF expression was associated with AD pathology,
its levels showed an independent association with
cognitive decline in a model adjusting for common
age-related
brain
pathologies.
Further
analyses
showed that the relation of AD pathology with the
rate of cognitive decline varied by BDNF expression.
Thus, higher BDNF expression reduced the effect of
AD pathology on the rate of cognitive decline. These
data suggest that a higher level of brain BDNF
expression
is
associated
with
slower
cognitive
decline and may provide reserve against the effects
of AD pathology in older adults.
BDNF promotes neurogenesis and angiogenesis in
the CNS. Its role in modulating interactions between
neuronal activity and synaptic plasticity is essential for
regulating cellular processes that underlie cognition
and other complex behaviors. While these functions
underscore BDNF’s potential utility for treating AD,
recent work suggests that BDNF may have a role in the
pathogenesis of AD.3 b-Amyloid peptide, which is
increased in AD, may interact with BDNF and suppress
its expression. In addition, BDNF may downregulate
the production of b-amyloid.19,20 Loss of BDNF in AD
may contribute to synaptic failure leading to impaired
cognition. Furthermore, some reports suggest that
BDNF polymorphisms such as Val66Met might be
associated with cognitive decline and an increased AD
risk.21 However, much of the existing work on BDNF
and AD derives from animal models. Given the com-
plex and varied actions of BDNF in the CNS, examin-
ing the association of its brain RNA expression levels
with the rate of cognitive decline during life in a wide
spectrum of older adults both with and without clinical
dementia is essential to understand the link of BDNF
with late-life cognitive impairment.

Brain BDNF expression level modifies the association of AD pathology
and the rate of cognitive decline
To display this association, 3 pairs of hypothetical average participants with their estimated
rate of cognitive decline based on the complete model with a 3-way interaction term with all
the cases analyzed in this study are illustrated. Model derived trajectories of cognitive
decline for participants with low (red, 10th percentile) and high (blue, 90th percentile) brain
BDNF gene expression levels with 3 levels of AD pathology: low (10%, solid), median (50%,
dashed), and high (90%, dotted). At all levels of AD pathology, the rate of cognitive decline is
slower in individuals with high levels of BDNF (blue) vs low BDNF expression levels (red). It is
evident that the difference in slopes of cognitive decline between the high levels of BDNF
expression (blue) and low levels of BDNF expression (red lines) is much greater for the dashed
lines (high AD pathology) as compared to the solid lines (low AD pathology). AD 5 Alzheimer

 The current study provides human data showing
that a higher level of brain BDNF expression is asso-
ciated with a slower rate of cognitive decline across a
wide range of cognitive abilities in community-
dwelling older adults. BDNF expression levels modi-
fied the association of clinical diagnosis with the rate
of cognitive decline, being most striking for individ-
uals with dementia. It is possible that the failure to
find a robust effect of BDNF among participants
without cognitive impairment is a result of a smaller
rate of change in cognition that limits power. A larger
study of individuals with NCI and MCI with longer
follow-up may be needed to show the association.
The current study found that BDNF expression
was independently associated with the rate of cogni-
tive decline. Some prior studies in humans with AD
have reported that brain BDNF levels are reduced and
others have reported increased levels.3 Because of its
unique design, the current study was able to compare
BDNF expression in individuals with and without
clinical AD, as well as to examine the relationship
of BDNF expression with postmortem indices of both
AD and other common age-related pathologies.
BDNF expression was inversely related to AD pathol-
ogy, but it was not associated with other common
age-related pathologies. Thus, individuals with clini-
cal dementia and postmortem evidence of AD pathol-
ogy had lower levels of BDNF expression.
While BDNF expression was independently asso-
ciated with cognitive decline, the current study also
found that BDNF expression modified and reduced
the association with AD pathology and cognitive
decline (figure 2). Thus, for each level of AD pathol-
ogy, an individual with a higher level of BDNF
expression (blue lines) had a slower rate of cognitive
decline. Thus, despite lower BDNF expression in per-
sons with more AD pathology, the protective effect of
BDNF was most striking among individuals with the
highest burden of AD pathology (figure 2). This find-
ing is analogous and complementary with the finding
that the effect modification of BDNF expression and
cognitive decline was strongest in individuals with
dementia (figure e-1). That reserve is most striking
in cases with more pathology has been noted previ-
ously for other cognitive reserve indicators.22 This
most likely reflects the fact that reserve is most nec-
essary for individuals with more pathology and greater
cognitive impairment. Thus, in addition to an asso-
ciation between BDNF expression and the rate of
cognitive decline, BDNF expression may also provide
reserve, which mitigates the deleterious effects of AD
pathology on cognitive decline.23
These results have potential translational conse-
quences. Prior reports of cognitive reserve have been
difficult to translate into the clinical setting because
the mechanisms linking behaviors such as education
or purpose in life with cognitive decline are
unclear.22,24 By contrast, this study identified a
known neurotrophin whose biology has been exten-
sively studied. Further work is needed to replicate
these findings and determine the direction of causal-
ity and whether strategies that increase brain BDNF
expression might one day be used to protect or slow
the rate of cognitive decline in older adults.
The study has strengths that lend confidence in
the findings. All participants were recruited from
the community and underwent an annual detailed
cognitive assessment. Uniform, structured clinical
and postmortem procedures were followed. Autopsy
rates were very high and all postmortem evaluations
were performed by examiners blinded to all clinical
data. The availability of several postmortem indices
provided an opportunity to examine the specificity
of the association of BDNF expression with AD
pathology.
This study has important limitations. First, partic-
ipants were selected by their willingness to participate
in these studies and do not represent the general pop-
ulation. BDNF expression was obtained from only one
brain region and expression likely varies in different
brain regions. Nonetheless, the associations of BDNF
levels in the current study did not vary with AD
pathology measured in 8 cortical regions. Observation
over a longer period of time and in a larger number of
older individuals would likely improve the estimation
of individual patterns of progressive cognitive decline
and provide more details on the relationship of BDNF
