ABSTRACT
Background: The United States Food and Drug Administration banned the stimulant 1,3-dimethylamyl-
amine (1,3-DMAA) from dietary supplements and warned consumers that the stimulant can pose car-
diovascular risks ranging from high blood pressure to heart attacks.
Objectives: We designed our study to determine if a new stimulant similar in structure to 1,3-DMAA
has been introduced as an ingredient in supplements sold in the United States (US).
Methods: We analyzed six brands of supplements that listed an ingredient on the label (e.g., Aconitum
kusnezoffii, DMHA or 2-amino-isoheptane) that might refer to an analog of 1,3-DMAA. Supplements
were analyzed by two separate laboratories using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography mass
spectrometry and reference standards.
Results: Two previously unidentified 1,3-DMAA analogs (2-amino-6-methylheptane [octodrine] and 1,4-
dimethylamylamine [1,4-DMAA]) and two banned stimulants (1,3-DMAA and 1,3-dimethylbutylamine
[1,3-DMBA]) were identified. Octodrine was found at a dose (±95% CI) of 72 ± 7.5 mg per serving. In
Europe, octodrine was previously sold as a pharmaceutical in multi-ingredient medications at dosages
from 8 to 33 mg. The quantity of octodrine found in our study was more than twice the largest
pharmaceutical dose. The other new stimulant, 1,4-DMAA, has not previously been approved for
human consumption, and its safety in humans is unknown. 1,4-DMAA was found at dosages between
21 ± 11 mg to 94 ± 48mg per serving. In addition, two banned stimulants – 1,3-DMAA and 1,3-DMBA –
were also identified: 24 ± 7.6 mg to 35± 11 mg of 1,3-DMAA and 51 ± 16mg of 1,3-DMBA. In one prod-
uct, 24 ± 7.6 mg of 1,3-DMAA was combined with 21 ± 11mg of 1,4-DMAA. 1,3-DMAA has been investi-
gated as potentially contributing to hemorrhagic strokes and sudden death, whereas the safety of 1,3-
DMBA in humans is unknown.
Conclusion: Two banned stimulants (1,3-DMAA and 1,3-DMBA) and two previously unidentified stimu-
lants (1,4-DMAA and octodrine) were identified in supplements sold in the United States.

Introduction
Epidemiologists at the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) reported in 2015 that dietary supplements
are responsible for tens of thousands of emergency depart-
ment visits and thousands of hospitalizations each year in
the United States (US) [1]. The CDC investigators found that
weight loss and sports supplements accounted for a dispro-
portionate number of emergency department visits, but why
these particular categories of supplements pose greater risks
to consumers is not well understood. One possibility is that
botanical stimulants contained in such products, including
caffeine and yohimbine, might contribute to these adverse
events [2,3]. Another possibility is that experimental, syn-
thetic stimulants found in many brands of weight loss and
sports supplements may contribute to the increased health
risks of these products [4–6].
Experimental stimulants, including analogs of amphet-
amine, methamphetamine and ephedrine, have been found
in hundreds of brands of weight loss and sports supplements
[7–10]. Until recently, the most common synthetic stimulant
in supplements was 1,3-dimethylamylamine (1,3-DMAA) [11].
However,
beginning
in
2012
the
US
Food
and
Drug
Administration (FDA) took enforcement actions to remove
1,3-DMAA from supplements due to a lack of evidence sup-
porting it as a legal dietary ingredient and safety concerns
[12]. Shortly thereafter, 1,3-dimethylbutylamine (1,3-DMBA),
an analog of 1,3-DMAA, was discovered in supplements [13].
In 2015, the FDA took enforcement actions to remove

 1,3-DMBA from supplements because the conditions for it to
be lawfully marketed had not been met [14]. Whether other
analogs of 1,3-DMAA have been introduced as novel ingre-
dients in sports and weight loss supplements since FDA took
action to remove 1,3-DMAA and 1,3-DMBA from supplements
remains unknown.
We designed the current study to determine if a new
stimulant structurally similar to 1,3-DMAA was present as an
ingredient in dietary supplements sold in the United States.
For the purposes of this study, we will refer to banned stimu-
lants as those ingredients for which the FDA had taken
enforcement action to remove from dietary supplements
prior to August 2016 (when the samples were purchased)
and use experimental stimulants to refer to banned stimulants
as well as those ingredients for which the FDA had not taken
enforcement action to remove from dietary supplements
prior to August 2016.
Materials and methods
Materials
Inclusion criteria for the dietary supplements were that they:
(1) were available for purchase in the United States in
August, 2016; and (2) listed at least one of the following
potential marketing names for an analog of 1,3-DMAA as an
ingredient on the label: 2-amino-isoheptane, DMHA, 2-amino-
6-methylheptane or Aconitum kusnezoffii. The Google search
engine was used to identify supplements meeting the inclu-
sion criteria; supplements were purchased online.
One container of each product was purchased, and each
container was subsampled and analyzed by NSF International
(Ann Arbor, MI). The remaining product was shipped to and
analyzed by the Netherland’s National Institute for Public
Health and the Environment (RIVM). NSF International carried
out qualitative and quantitative analyses. RIVM carried out
only qualitative analysis using different methods for an inde-
pendent confirmation of identity.
NSF obtained the following reference standards: 6-methyl-
heptan-2-amine, 99.2% (octodrine, 2-amino-6-methylheptane,
6-methyl-2-heptanamine, 1,5-dimethylhexylamine), 5-methyl-
hexan-2-amine,

(1,4-DMAA,
1,4-dimethylamylamine,
2-amino-5-methylhexane, 5-methyl-2-hexanamine), 4-methyl-
hexan-2-amine (1,3-DMAA, 1,3-dimethylamylamine, 2-amino-
4-methylhexane)
and
4-methylpentan-2-amine
99.7%
(1,3-DMBA,
1,3-dimethylbutylamine,
2-amino-4-methylpen-

fluorobutyric acid (HFBA, ion chromatography grade), from
Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO); and acetonitrile (LCMS grade),
from EMD-Millipore (Billerica, MA).
RIVM obtained 1,3-DMBA, 3,3-dimethylbutylamine (3,3-
DMBA), 1,4-DMAA, 1,3-DMAA, octodrine and 2-amino-isohep-
tane

Analytical methods
Two different methanol extraction methods were utilized, and
the extracts were analyzed using one gas chromatography
mass spectrometry (GC-MS) method and six liquid chromatog-
raphy mass spectrometry methods. See Supplemental data for
full details of the analytical methods and their validation.
Results
Seven dietary supplement products met our inclusion criteria,
and six were available for purchase: four were marketed as
sports supplements and two as weight loss supplements. The
identity and quantity of stimulants detected are provided in
Table 1. Structures of the stimulants are illustrated
in
Figure 1, and examples of the product ion chromatograms
from

Figure 2.
The ingredients described on the label did not consist-
ently correspond to specific stimulants in the products. For
example,
two
supplements
were
labeled
as
containing
“2-amino-6-methylheptane”, which is a synonym for octo-
drine, but only one contained octodrine and the other con-
tained 1,4-DMAA. Four products were labeled as containing
“2-aminoisoheptane”, a nonspecific term, and the contents of
each product differed: one contained 1,4-DMAA, one con-
tained 1,3-DMAA, one contained 1,3-DMBA and one con-
tained both 1,3-DMAA and 1,4-DMAA. Three products listed
Aconitum kusnezoffii as the source of “2-aminoisoheptane”
and each contained a different stimulant (i.e., 1,3-DMAA, 1,4-
DMAA and 1,3-DMBA, respectively). The FDA was informed of
our findings in June, 2017.
Discussion
We identified two stimulants that the FDA has previously
taken enforcement action to remove from dietary supple-
ments (i.e., 1,3-DMAA and 1,3-DMBA) [12,14] and two stimu-
lants that have not before been described in the scientific
literature as an ingredient in supplements (i.e., 1,4-DMAA and
octodrine). To better understand the potential health effects
of these two novel stimulants, we reviewed the relevant ani-
mal and human studies of 1,4-DMAA and octodrine. We also
briefly summarize the rationale for FDA enforcement actions
to remove 1,3-DMAA and 1,3-DMBA from supplements.
1,4-Dimethylamylamine (1,4-DMAA)
Only a few scientific studies have investigated the physio-
logical effects of 1,4-DMAA. Preliminary studies of 1,4-DMAA
performed in cats and dogs from the 1940s and 1950s dem-
onstrate pressor effects, including increased heart rate and

 blood pressure [15–19]. We are aware of only one descrip-
tion in the peer-reviewed literature of human consumption
of 1,4-DMAA: a 1948 report involving a single male subject
[17]. To the best of our knowledge, 1,4-DMAA has never
been studied in a randomized controlled trial. Therefore,
its safety is unknown, but results from preliminary animal
studies suggest that its use may pose health risks in
humans.
Several supplement labels listed the stimulant as if it were
an extract or a constituent of Aconitum kusnezoffii. Aconitum
is a genus of flowering plants, commonly referred to as
monkshood, found in the Northern hemisphere. Some spe-
cies of Aconitum have been used in traditional Chinese medi-
cine to treat cardiac insufficiency and other conditions [20].
However, we could find no scientific evidence that 1,4-DMAA
had ever been detected in, or extracted from, Aconitum kus-
nezoffii. 1,4-DMAA has been reported to be a constituent of
two
plants
(Datura
stramonium
[jimson
weed]
and
Pelargonium graveolens [a geranium]), one bacteria (Bacillus
atrophaeus) and a degradation product of corn [21–26]. The
majority of these studies [23–26] are tentative identifications,
which used gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS)
library matches only. However, two studies reportedly con-
firmed the presence of low levels of 1,4-DMAA in samples
from the geranium Pelargonium graveolens (notably both of
these studies were funded by a single supplement company)
[21,22]. Given the quality of research to date, it remains

 unknown as to whether 1,4-DMAA is actually present in
plants or bacteria, and, if so, in what quantities.
Octodrine (6-methyl-2-heptanamine, DMHA)
Octodrine, unlike 1,4-DMAA, has a history of use as a
pharmaceutical drug. It was originally developed in the
United States as an aerosolized treatment for bronchitis,
laryngitis and other conditions [27]. Initially approved by the
FDA in 1946 as Eskay’s Oralator, this inhaler appeared only in
the 1949 edition of the Physicians’ Desk Reference [27]. Why
the inhaled formulation of octodrine was marketed for only a
short period of time remains unknown. A second aerosolized
octodrine preparation (combined with propylhexedrine) was
approved by the FDA in the 1960s; it was initially developed
as Vaporpac [sic] and later its name was changed to Tickle
Tackel Inhaler [sic] [28]. Despite FDA approval of these
inhalers, we could find no evidence that either Vaporpac or
Tickle Tackel Inhaler was previously sold in the United States;
neither of these inhalers appear in the Physicians’ Desk
Reference or other pharmaceutical reference texts.
The FDA approved two inhaled versions of octodrine, but
never an oral preparation. However, in Germany and other
European countries, octodrine was developed as an oral drug.
Octodrine was combined with several other medications,
including theophylline, 3-octopamine and adenosine, in multi-
ingredient tablets sold between the early 1960s through the
mid-2000s under the trade names Ambredin, Ordinal, Ordinal
Retard and Ordinal Forte [29–32]. These multi-ingredient drugs
were marketed for hypotension, asthma and other conditions
and were formulated to contain 8.2 mg, 16.5 mg and 33 mg of
octodrine as a free base compared to the 72 ± 7.5 mg of octo-
drine per serving found in the current study [29–32].
Preliminary studies have been published on the effects of
octodrine in animals and humans. Approximately a dozen
studies from the 1940s through the 1970s investigated the
effects of octodrine in mice, rats, guinea pigs, rabbits, cats
and dogs [15,16,33–41]. These studies found that octodrine
can increase blood pressure and cardiac output in larger ani-
mals [34–41]. Central nervous system stimulation has been
suggested by studies of rats and mice [34,35,39]. Acute tox-
icity studies in cats found toxic doses of the drug led to
dilated pupils, vomiting and convulsions [34].
Preliminary human studies of octodrine have also been
published. In 1973, three male subjects received orally
administered radiolabeled octodrine [42]. Oral absorption
was rapid with maximum serum concentrations two hours
after consumption. In 1974, a combination product including
octodrine, 3-octopamine and adenosine was studied as a
treatment for low blood pressure in 20 patients [43]. Two
studies from the 1950s investigated the effects of an unspeci-
fied, inhaled dose of the drug in human subjects: it was
found to increase lung volume [44,45]. We are aware of only
one report in the peer-reviewed literature involving four
human subjects in which octodrine is described as being
administered to humans as a single oral agent (i.e., not part
of a multi-ingredient formulation) [37]. Given the lack of any
placebo-controlled trial of octodrine as an individual drug,
the safety of octodrine remains unknown, but the animal
experiments suggest the potential for adverse cardiovascular
effects [34–41].
The supplement product containing octodrine did not
imply that the drug had been extracted from a natural
source. But as it was listed as a dietary ingredient, we
reviewed all studies that purportedly identified octodrine in
nature. Several studies suggest the potential presence of
octodrine in nature, including studies of a Forsynthia suspen-
sion, Acotinum kusnezoffii, Microcystis aeruginosa (an algae),
Datura stramonium (jimson weed), Kigelia africana (sausage
tree), Biomphytum veldkampii (a small palm), Psetta mexima
(turbot fish) and an unidentified species of sea shrimp
[23,46–53]. None of these putative identifications – based
only on a GC-MS library match – have been confirmed nor
have any of these investigations purported to extract octo-
drine from these plants or animals.
Banned stimulants: 1,3-dimethylamylamine (1,3-DMAA)
and 1,3-dimethylbutylamine (1,3-DMBA)
We also identified 1,3-DMAA and 1,3-DMBA; two synthetic
stimulants that the FDA has attempted to remove as ingre-
dients in supplements since 2012 and 2015, respectively
[12,14,54]. Elsewhere, we have reviewed the animal and
human data involving 1,3-DMAA and 1,3-DMBA [11,13,55]. In
brief, 1,3-DMAA was initially marketed for nasal inhalation
beginning in the 1940s but was withdrawn from the US mar-
ket by the 1970s for unknown reasons. The FDA has never
approved 1,3-DMAA for oral consumption. 1,3-DMAA has
been investigated as potentially contributing to hemorrhagic
stokes and sudden death, [4,55] and the FDA has warned
consumers that 1,3-DMAA can pose cardiovascular risks [12].
The physiological effects of 1,3-DMBA remain even less
understood. Two small, preliminary animal studies from the
1940s found that 1,3-DMBA has pressor effects in cats and
dogs [15,16]. However, we are not aware of any peer-
reviewed
studies
of
1,3-DMBA’s
physiological
effects
in
humans.
Our study adds to a growing body of literature that high-
lights the difficulty for regulatory authorities to prevent the
use of potentially dangerous ingredients in dietary supple-
ments and to effectively remove them from the market
[56,57]. Previous studies have found that weight loss, sports
and sexual enhancement supplements remain available to
consumers years after FDA recalls [56,57]. For example, the
US Department of Defense found that more than 45 brands
of supplements listed 1,3-DMAA on the label several years
after the FDA attempted to eliminate it from supplements,
[58] and a recent study found stores selling supplements list-
ing multiple banned ingredients on the labels [59].
Limitations
Our study has several limitations. Our methodology was not
designed such that the quantitative findings would be repre-
sentative of these products or the market as a whole, rather
the quantitative results present a snapshot as to what a
4

 consumer might be exposed to. These initial results demon-
strate that these stimulants are not trace contaminants and
rather appear to be added to these products in quantities
expected to produce pharmacological effects. While the quan-
titative data are preliminary, we definitely identified two new
stimulants sold on the US market and the continued presence
of two banned stimulants. Second, we analyzed only supple-
ments that listed 2-amino-isoheptane, Aconitum kusnezoffii or
other potential marketing names for analogs of 1,3-DMAA on
the label. It is possible that supplements not listing any of
these ingredients on the label might also contain one or more
of these experimental stimulants. Therefore, our study should
not be considered as inclusive of all supplement brands sold
in the United States that contain these stimulants. The FDA
should consider investigating the presence of these stimulants
in other high-risk products. Finally, we analyzed supplements
only for structural analogs of 1,3-DMAA, and it is possible that
these products contain other physiologically active ingredients
or that the specific stimulant included in a product might
change from batch to batch.
Conclusions
In a study of dietary supplements, we found two stimulants
which the FDA, the agency responsible for the regulation of
supplements in the US, has attempted to remove from supple-
ments, 1,3-DMAA and 1,3-DMBA, and two new experimental
stimulants, octodrine and 1,4-DMAA. Of the four stimulants,
only the stimulant octodrine has previously been marketed as
an oral drug, and the recommended serving size found in our
study was greater than twice the highest pharmaceutical dose
previously available. In animal models, all four of these com-
pounds have pressor effects. The FDA has warned that one of
these stimulants, 1,3-DMAA, may pose cardiovascular risks,
and it is possible that the other three stimulants may pose
similar risks to consumers. Consumers should be warned
about the presence of these four experimental stimulants in
supplements. Until these stimulants are eliminated as supple-
ment ingredients, we recommend that consumers avoid sup-
plements labeled as containing 2-aminoisoheptane, 2-amino-
6-methylheptane, DMHA or Aconitum kusnezoffii. Physicians
should remain alert to the possibility that patients may be
inadvertently exposed to experimental stimulants when con-
suming weight loss and sports supplements.
