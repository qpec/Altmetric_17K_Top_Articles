Abstract
Background Appendicitis is the most common abdominal surgical emergency worldwide. Differences between high- and 
low-income settings in the availability of laparoscopic appendectomy, alternative management choices, and outcomes are 
poorly described. The aim was to identify variation in surgical management and outcomes of appendicitis within low-, mid-
dle-, and high-Human Development Index (HDI) countries worldwide.
Methods This is a multicenter, international prospective cohort study. Consecutive sampling of patients undergoing emer-
gency appendectomy over 6 months was conducted. Follow-up lasted 30 days.
Results 4546 patients from 52 countries underwent appendectomy (2499 high-, 1540 middle-, and 507 low-HDI groups). Sur-
gical site infection (SSI) rates were higher in low-HDI (OR 2.57, 95% CI 1.33–4.99, p = 0.005) but not middle-HDI countries 
(OR 1.38, 95% CI 0.76–2.52, p = 0.291), compared with high-HDI countries after adjustment. A laparoscopic approach was 
common in high-HDI countries (1693/2499, 67.7%), but infrequent in low-HDI (41/507, 8.1%) and middle-HDI (132/1540, 
8.6%) groups. After accounting for case-mix, laparoscopy was still associated with fewer overall complications (OR 0.55, 
95% CI 0.42–0.71, p < 0.001) and SSIs (OR 0.22, 95% CI 0.14–0.33, p < 0.001). In propensity-score matched groups within 
low-/middle-HDI countries, laparoscopy was still associated with fewer overall complications (OR 0.23 95% CI 0.11–0.44) 
and SSI (OR 0.21 95% CI 0.09–0.45).
Conclusion A laparoscopic approach is associated with better outcomes and availability appears to differ by country HDI. 
Despite the profound clinical, operational, and financial barriers to its widespread introduction, laparoscopy could signifi-
cantly improve outcomes for patients in low-resource environments.

The global burden of diseases requiring emergency surgery 
is poorly described and represents a significant health prob-
lem [1]. Most of the world’s population do not have access 
to safe, affordable and timely surgery, with access inequita-
bly distributed in favor of high Human Development Index 
(HDI) countries [2]. It is estimated that in 2010, approxi-
mately 17 million deaths resulted from conditions requiring 
surgical care, far greater than the combined burden of HIV/
AIDs, malaria, and tuberculosis [3]. There is an urgent need 
to increase access to surgical treatment across the world.
Appendicitis is one of the commonest diseases requiring 
emergency abdominal surgery, yet little data exist to allow 
comparison of management and outcomes at a patient level 
globally [4]. Recently published trends predict a significant 
increase in the prevalence of appendicitis in newly industri-
alized countries [5]. Data from the Global Burden of Dis-
ease Study (2016) show a higher prevalence of appendicitis 
in lower socio-economic countries, together with a greater

proportion of years-of-life-lost as a result of the disease 
[6]. Appendicitis is usually treated with surgery, although 
management purely with antibiotics has been investigated 
[7]. Appendectomy can be performed by a traditional open 
procedure, but a laparoscopic approach has become common 
in many countries [8]. Significant variation in practice still 
exists in high-income settings [9].
The role of laparoscopy in low-resource healthcare 
settings has been debated [10]. Those arguing against its 
use suggest that the required initial financial and training 
investment, together with the on-going costs of equipment 
upkeep and consumables, make it unviable when compared 
to relatively straightforward open surgery. This argument 
has resonance: when a healthcare system is struggling to 
deliver basic surgical procedures, the introduction of a more 
complex intervention must be considered carefully. On the 
other hand, there are broad advantages to having laparos-
copy available, particularly the ability to perform diagnostic 
laparoscopy in the absence of expensive CT imaging. Lower 
postoperative complication rates [9] and consequent health-
care costs are commonly reported to be associated with lapa-
roscopic appendectomy. Whether laparoscopy has the same 
advantage in low-resource settings is unknown.
The GlobalSurg Collaborative has recently demonstrated 
the feasibility of conducting international data collection 
in low-resource settings [4, 11]. Using these approaches, 
this study aimed to investigate the surgical management of 
appendectomy worldwide, including the use of laparoscopy, 
and to examine outcomes following surgery.
Methods
Study setting
A collaborative, international, multicenter, prospective, 
observational cohort study was conducted according to a 
pre-specified, published protocol (ClinicalTrials.gov iden-
tifier: NCT02179112) [12]. The collaborative network 
methodology has been described elsewhere [13]. Briefly, 
the study was conducted by teams of local investigators 
coordinated by a national lead investigator. Investigators 
were recruited via the GlobalSurg network and through dis-
semination on social media and other personal contacts. 
Consecutive sampling of patients undergoing emergency 
abdominal surgery was undertaken during 2-week periods 
within a 6-month study window. Investigators in a hospital 
could choose one or multiple 2-week periods. There was an 
absolute requirement for all cases in the chosen period(s) 
to be included, but no minimum number set to avoid bias 
against smaller centers. A UK National Health Service 
Research Ethics review considered this study exempt from 
formal research registration (South East Scotland Research 
Ethics Service, reference NR/1404AB12); individual 
centers obtained their own audit, ethical or institutional 
approval. This study is reported according to the Strength-
ening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemi-
ology (STROBE) guidelines [14]. Pre-specified sub-group 
analyses included the examination of patients undergoing 
appendectomy as compared with other abdominal surgical 
procedures. At each participating center, data collection 
was performed by teams following the same standardized 
protocol [12].
Patients and procedures
The study inclusion period was 01 July 2014 to 31 Decem-
ber 2014. Consecutive patients undergoing emergency 
appendectomy were eligible for inclusion. No limits were 
placed on age or operative approach. Emergency surgery was 
defined as any unplanned, non-elective operation, including 
re-operation after a previous procedure. Elective (planned) 
or semi-elective procedures (where a patient initially admit-
ted as an emergency was then discharged from hospital and 
re-admitted at later time for surgery) were excluded.
Data
Data were selected to be objective, standardized, eas-
ily transcribed and internationally relevant, to maximize 
record completion and accuracy. Patients were followed for 
30 days after surgery or for the length of their inpatient stay 
where follow-up was not feasible. Records were uploaded 
by local investigators to a secure online website, provided 
using the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) 
system [15]. The lead investigator at each site was respon-
sible for “signing off” patient records. Data were checked 
with primary data sources if necessary. The local lead 
was responsible for ensuring consecutive sampling (i.e., 
no excluded cases) for each site. The submitted data were 
then checked centrally and where missing data were identi-
fied, the local lead investigator was contacted and asked to 
investigate. Once vetted, the record was accepted into the 
dataset for analysis.
Patient variables included age, gender, American Soci-
ety of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status classification 
system, diabetes history, smoking and diagnostic category. 
Service variables included use of the WHO surgical safety 
checklist, the experience of surgeon/anesthetist, and compli-
ance with selected evidence-based standards. Prophylactic 
antibiotic use was defined as antibiotics administered either 
at induction, or during surgery but before opening of a con-
taminated space.

Outcome variables
The primary outcome measure was overall complication 
rate, defined using the Clavien–Dindo grade occurring 
within 30 days of the index operation. The criteria required 
for each outcome were defined a priori in the protocol [12]. 
Major complication (Clavien–Dindo IV) was defined as a 
life-threatening illness requiring critical care management. 
In low-resource settings, investigators could report “com-
plication requiring critical care, but facilities unavailable.”
The US Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 
definitions for SSI and organ space infection (OSI) were 
used [16]. SSI: one of (1) purulent drainage from the inci-
sion; (2) at least two of following: pain or tenderness, local-
ized swelling, redness, heat, fever, and the incision is opened 
deliberately to manage infection; (3) wound organisms 
AND pus cells from aspirate/swab. OSI: intra-abdominal/
pelvic detected clinically/symptomatically, radiologically, 
or intra-operatively.
Power considerations
The sample size was limited by practical factors and estima-
tion of power by uncertainty over critical quantities such as 
clustering and variation by diagnosis. An indicative calcula-
tion for overall complication rate showed that considerable 
precision was likely with 520 patients per HDI comparison 
group (a 6% point difference in overall complication rate; 
baseline rate 16% with alpha = 0.05, beta = 0.2, and account-
ing for missing data/loss to follow-up).
Statistical analysis
Variation across different international health settings was 
assessed by stratifying participating centers by country into 
three tertiles according to HDI rank. This is a composite 
statistic of life expectancy, education, and income indices 
published by the United Nations (http://hdr.undp.org/en/stati 
stics 
). Differences between HDI tertiles were initially tested 
with the Pearson chi-squared and Kruskal–Wallis tests for 
categorical and continuous variables respectively.
Multivariable binary logistic regression models were 
constructed to adjust for case-mix and measures of hospital 
facilities and service, to explore the nature of differences 
in outcome. Subsequently, three-level hierarchical multi-
variable logistic regression models were made to account 
for hospital- and country-level variation (“hospital” and 
“country” as random effects with constrained gradients). 
Variable selection was incremental and accounted for both 
clinical and statistical significances. Model fit was guided 
log-likelihood methods including the Akaike Information 
Criterion (AIC). Discrimination was defined by the area-
under-the receiver-operator-curve (c-statistic). Calibration 
across the range of observed probabilities was checked. All 
two-way interactions were investigated. Bayesian simulation 
methods are described in the supplementary digital content.
In a further propensity-score matched study, patients from 
low- and middle-HDI countries were analyzed separately to 
those from high-HDI countries. Patients who had undergone 
laparoscopic surgery were matched with those who under-
went open surgery using a “nearest neighbor” approach, 
based on probabilities of group membership determined 
with multivariable logistic regression. The matching algo-
rithm used age, gender, smoking status, ASA score, and per-
foration status. Pre- and post-matching balance was checked 
for all relevant variables.
All analyses were undertaken using the R Foundation 
Statistical Program (R 3.1.1, R Foundation for Statistical 
Computing) and Stan (Stan: A C++ Library for Probability 
and Sampling, Version 2.10.0. URL http://mc-stan.org/).
Results
4546 patients underwent laparoscopic or open appendec-
tomy for acute appendicitis over the data collection period.
Demographics
Patients were from 52 countries with high-HDI (n = 2499), 
middle-HDI (n = 1540), and low-HDI (n = 507) groups 
(Table 1). Patients in low-HDI countries were younger (Pear-
son’s χ2 test, p < 0.001) and more likely to be male [low-HDI 
(295/507, 58%), middle-HDI (783/1540, 51%), high-HDI 
(1344/2499, 54%), p = 0.012]. There were numerically more 
patients considered to have severe systemic disease (ASA 3 
or greater) in the low-HDI group (p = 0.021).
Surgical characteristics
There were clear differences in management between HDI 
groups (Table 1). A laparoscopic approach was used in 
67.7% of patients in the high-HDI group and in < 10% in the 
low- and middle-HDI groups (Pearson’s χ2 test, p < 0.001). 
There was more operating through the night in low- and 
middle-HDI groups (Pearson’s χ2 test, p < 0.001), while 
more patients were operated upon > 24 h after admission 
in high-HDI countries. Seniority of both the surgeon and 
anesthetist was higher in high-HDI countries. Prophylactic 
antibiotics and use of the WHO surgical safety checklist was 
less common in low- and middle-HDI groups.
Outcomes
In univariable analyses, associations were seen between HDI 
and overall and minor complications, as well as surgical site 
 3453

1 3
and OSIs (Table 2). There was no strong association between 
HDI and reintervention, major complication, or death.
The overall complication rate was higher in low-HDI 
(odds ratio (OR) 1.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) 
1.19–1.99, p = 0.001) and middle-HDI (OR 1.24, 95% CI 
1.03–1.49, p = 0.020) countries compared with the high-
HDI group (Tables 2, 3). When the analysis was adjusted 
in a multilevel model accounting for patient, disease, and

hospital structural factors, there was no independent associa-
tion between overall complications and HDI group.
A further prominent association was seen with more 
surgical site infection (SSI) in low-HDI (OR 3.81, 95% CI 
2.78–5.19, p < 0.001) and middle-HDI (OR 2.99, 95% CI 
2.34–3.84, p < 0.001) compared with high-HDI (Tables 2, 
4). In the multilevel model, the association persisted in 
low-HDI (OR 2.57, 95% CI 1.33–4.99, p = 0.005) but 
not middle-HDI (OR 1.38, 95% CI 0.76–2.52, p = 0.291) 
countries.
There was no association in multilevel models between 
HDI and OSI (Table S1, Supplemental Digital Content).
Determining any influence of laparoscopy compared with 
an open approach is difficult given the inherent selection 
bias and the lower availability in low-HDI and middle-HDI 
countries. This is highlighted by the different populations 
undergoing laparoscopic compared with open procedures 
(Table S2, Supplemental Digital Content). Differences in 
the laparoscopic group included more females, lower ASA 
score, a greater likelihood of senior surgeon and anesthetist 
involvement, and lower perforation rates. Two approaches 
were taken to attempt to reduce the effect of this imbalance: 
multilevel logistic regression modeling and a propensity-
score matched analysis.
After accounting for case-mix imbalance, laparoscopy 
was still associated with significantly fewer complications 
(OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.42–0.71, p < 0.001, Table 3) and SSIs 
(OR 0.22, 95% CI 0.14–0.33, p < 0.001, Table 4). To try 
and communicate these differences more meaningfully, a 
simple simulation was performed using different patient 
baseline characteristics (Table 5). This analysis shows an 
absolute risk reduction (ARR) in overall complication

rate associated with laparoscopy of around 6% [number-
needed-to-treat (NNT) = 16] in the absence of perforation 
and 17% (NNT = 8) when the appendix is perforated across 
HDI groups. For SSI, the analysis implies a greater poten-
tial benefit of laparoscopy in low-HDI (ARR 18.6%, 95% 
CI 11.4–27.7 with perforation) and middle-income coun-
tries (ARR 12.2%, 95% CI 6.6–19.6% with perforation), 
which is expected given the association of HDI and SSI 
seen in the multilevel model.
To further explore these relationships, a propensity-
score-based matching analysis was performed. Patients 
were first subset into low-/middle-HDI and high-HDI 
groups. Using all available independent baseline vari-
ables and a nearest neighbor approach, 167 patients in the 
laparoscopic group were matched to 167 in the open group 
in the low-/middle-HDI subset (Fig. 1, Tables S3 and S4, 
Supplemental Digital Content) and 783 matched in the 
high-HDI group. Balance was more easily achieved in the 
low-/middle-HDI group, with persistent imbalance only 
seen for seniority of anesthetist and surgical safety check-
list use. Balance using nearest neighbor matching was dif-
ficult to achieve in the high-HDI group, reflecting de facto 
differences in the characteristics of patients offered laparo-
scopic compared with those undergoing open procedures 
in practice. Alternative matching procedures were success-
fully explored, but have not been included for space and 
clarity. Adjusted logistic regression models were applied 
to the matched sets to address any residual confounding. 
In the low-/middle-HDI group, a laparoscopic approach 
was still associated with fewer overall complications (OR 
0.23 95% CI 0.11–0.44, p < 0.001), minor complications 
(OR 0.16 95% CI 0.06–0.35, p < 0.001), and episodes of 
SSI (OR 0.21 95% CI 0.09–0.45, p < 0.001) (Table S5, 
Supplemental Digital Content, Fig. 1). Similar results were 
observed within the matched high-HDI group (Table S6, 
Supplemental Digital Content).
Discussion
This is the first patient-level prospective study to describe 
the surgical approach to appendectomy and the frequency 
of postoperative complications on a global scale. Our find-
ings reveal clear differences in the management of appen-
dicitis and disparities in complication frequency between 
different HDI groups, with significantly more wound infec-
tions (SSI) in low-HDI versus high-HDI countries. A lapa-
roscopic approach was common in the high-HDI group 
(1693/2499, 67.7%) but infrequent in low- (41/507, 8.1%) 
and middle-HDI (132/1540, 8.6%) groups. In analyses that 
attempted as far as it is possible to account for the inher-
ent selection bias in these observational data, laparoscopy 
in low-/middle-HDI countries was significantly associated 
with fewer complications and lower SSI rates.
We have previously shown differences in outcomes after 
emergency surgery by HDI, with mortality found to be 
higher in low- and middle-HDI countries compared with 
high-HDI countries both in adults [4] and children [17]. 
In the present study, unadjusted analyses show a similar 
picture. However, in the multivariable analysis for overall

complications, no persistent association was seen with 
HDI after accounting for case-mix and structural differ-
ences. There were persistent differences seen in SSI rates 
after adjustment. SSI is therefore a phenomenon in which 
factors not accounted for in our models play an important 
role. More studies are needed to understand how this can 
be intervened upon.
It is well established in high-income settings that lapa-
roscopic appendectomy is associated with better outcomes; 
however, little information exists in low-resource settings 
[18–21]. Wei et al. undertook a randomized comparison 
of open and laparoscopic appendectomy and concluded 
that a laparoscopic approach was associated with lower 
SSI rates and fewer complications,[18] a finding similar 
to that observed in the current study. Further advantages 
include reduced postoperative stay, less postoperative pain, 
and lower oxidative stress [19, 20]. In our study, the pres-
ence of a perforated appendix was associated with a 3- to 
4-fold increase in adverse outcomes in multivariable mod-
els, including an increased surgical site and organ space 
(abscess) infection, findings similar to previous studies 
[21]. It has been debated whether a laparoscopic approach is 
always appropriate for patients with more advanced disease 
and peritonitis; however, evidence does exist supporting a 
laparoscopy even in complicated cases where reduced infec-
tion rates and postoperative length of stay can be achieved 
[22, 23].
Appendicitis is common in low-resource settings but its 
incidence varies greatly by country. It is the fourth-most 
common procedure performed by training surgeons in the 
College of Surgeons of East, Central and Southern Africa 
(COSECSA) region [24]. Appendicitis also presents dif-
ferently in the poorest countries,[25] which is supported in 
the current study by the higher perforation rate seen in the 
low-HDI group (21.5%) compared with high-HDI group 
(13.9%). Given traditional assumptions around treatment 
delay and progression to perforation, this may be due to the 
well-described first-delay in seeking medical attention in 
low-HDI settings, compounded by a second-delay in reach-
ing a medical facility that may be many days’ travel away 
[3]. Alternatively, this may represent a pathophysiological 
distinction between perforated and non-perforated appen-
dicitis,[26] with selection exaggerated in low-resource set-
tings by delays in seeking medical attention arising from

geographic barriers to access, cultural differences, and the 
potential out-of-pocket impoverishing or catastrophic costs 
of surgery discouraging all but the sickest in attending hos-
pital [27, 28].
The increased use of laparoscopy in low-income settings 
is controversial. In the poorest regions, the provision of 
any surgical service is extremely difficult and current high-
technology, resource intensive laparoscopy is not feasible. 
However, our results raise the possibility of a benefit for 
patients and the healthcare system more widely. Given the 
higher rates of SSI in some low-income settings, the absolute 
benefit of laparoscopy is likely to be greater as shown by 
the simulation results [ARR of SSI in low-HDI countries 
(18.6%) compared with high-HDI countries (11.2%)]. This 
translates to a NNT with laparoscopic rather than open sur-
gery of 6 to prevent one SSI in low-HDI countries manag-
ing perforated appendicitis. Moreover, in the absence of CT 
imaging, diagnostic laparoscopy can provide an effective 
way to investigate patients with acute abdominal pain short 
of the requirement for a full laparotomy.
The major strength of this study is the collection of 
patient-level prospective data from 52 countries. This unique 
dataset allows comparison across the HDI spectrum which is 
rarely possible. A published, detailed protocol translated into 
major languages ensured consistent data collection across 
varying regions without the burden of communication bar-
riers. Local validation by leads ensured data accuracy and 
completeness was high. The interpretation of observational 
data is always difficult due to the inherent bias implicit in 
treatment allocation of patients. We have explored both mul-
tilevel models accounting for clustering patients in hospitals 
and countries, and propensity-score-matched models. In the 
latter, patients within low-/middle-HDI countries undergo-
ing open or laparoscopic approaches were matched using 
available baseline variables, thus attempting to compare only 
“similar” patients who had undergone alternative treatments. 
Good balance was achieved and benefits of laparoscopy con-
tinue to be seen.
There are a number of weaknesses associated with our 
approach. Denominator data at a country level cannot easily 
be collected using this methodology. The “snapshot” may 
not accurately reflect overall practice, particularly where 
there are prominent seasonal effects [29]. We were not able 
to capture the degree of sepsis beyond the ASA and perfora-
tion rates, which may result in residual confounding. Within 
low-income, rural settings, collection of 30-day follow-up 
data can be challenging as patients are often discharged to 
remote regions and therefore cannot return to attend follow-
up clinics. This was minimized by liberal use of telephone 
follow-up where feasible. A subsequent validation study of 
this methodology suggests that telephone follow-up is pos-
sible in upwards of one-third of included patients. Validation 
of data entry is challenging particularly where patient record 
keeping is limited. Collaborators frequently commented that 
the collected study data were of higher quality than exist-
ing hospital data. At each participating center, a lead was 
appointed to perform data validation and ensure accurate 
data-entry.
These results have significant implications for policy 
makers. Variation exists in outcomes after appendectomy 
across the world, but at least some of that variation may be 
explained by local surgical infrastructure such as the availa-
bility of laparoscopic surgery. Health services are faced with 
competing priorities and must balance a desire to improve 
surgical care with the costs of treating, say, malaria. The 
introduction of any new technology in a resource-poor set-
ting must also be done with care. Recommendations include 
ensuring the existence of sufficient financial support and 
organizational systems to address staff training, including 
biomedical engineering staff to undertake equipment main-
tenance, and to establish robust, affordable, and sustainable 
supply chains [10]. A successful implementation of lapa-
roscopic surgery has already been demonstrated at scale in 
low-resource settings [30].
Future research must focus on identifying innovative, 
affordable, and safe strategies to implement and scale 
laparoscopic surgery in low-resource settings. Such adap-
tive techniques may include gasless laparoscopy, room air 
insufflation, and development of affordable, reusable instru-
mentation. In addition, there is an ongoing need to establish 
robust systems for the continuous measurement of surgical 
outcomes across the world. High-quality clinical trials rel-
evant to low-HDI countries must be performed to ensure the 
identification of the most effective treatments, such as how 
to reduce SSI. Outcomes in surgery will only improve with 
system-wide improvements across the pre-hospital, hospital, 
and post-hospital sectors.
This study has shown significant variation in the man-
agement and outcomes following appendectomy worldwide. 
The availability of laparoscopy differs by country HDI, and 
appears to be significantly associated with better outcomes. 
There are profound clinical, operational, and financial barri-
ers to the introduction of laparoscopy that if overcome could 
result in significantly improved outcomes for patients and 
the wider health system in low-resource environments.
