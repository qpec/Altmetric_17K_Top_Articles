abstract
The American Academy of Pediatrics recognizes the important role school 
nurses play in promoting the optimal biopsychosocial health and well-being 
of school-aged children in the school setting. Although the concept of a 
school nurse has existed for more than a century, uniformity among states 
and school districts regarding the role of a registered professional nurse 
in schools and the laws governing it are lacking. By understanding the 
benefi
 ts, roles, and responsibilities of school nurses working as a team with 
the school physician, as well as their contributions to school-aged children, 
pediatricians can collaborate with, support, and promote school nurses in 
their own communities, thus improving the health, wellness, and safety of 
children and adolescents.
INTRODUCTION
Traditionally, the school nursing role was designed to support 
educational achievement by promoting student attendance. The first 
school nurse, Lina Rogers, was appointed in 1902 to tend to the health of 
8671 students in 4 separate schools in New York City. Her early success 
in reducing absenteeism led to the hiring of 12 more nurses. Within 1 
year, medical exclusions decreased by 99%.1
Over the past century, the role of the school nurse has expanded to 
include critical components, such as surveillance, chronic disease 
management, emergency preparedness, behavioral health assessment, 
ongoing health education, extensive case management, and much more. 
Although the position has taken on a more comprehensive approach, the 
core focus of keeping students healthy and in school remains unchanged. 
School attendance is essential for academic success.
School nurses provide both individual and population health through 
their daily access to large numbers of students, making them well 
positioned to address and coordinate the health care needs of children 
and adolescents. The impact of social determinants of health are 
felt in the school setting and well known to school nurses.2,

nursing is a specialized practice of 
professional nursing that advances 
the well-being, academic success, 
and lifelong achievement and health 
of students. To that end, school 
nurses understand and educate 
about normal development; promote 
health and safety, including a healthy 
environment; intervene with actual 
and potential health problems; 
provide case-management services; 
and actively collaborate with 
physicians who work in schools, 
such as medical advisors and team 
physicians, families, community 
service providers, and health care 
providers, to build student and 
family capacity for adaptation, self-
management, self-advocacy, and 
learning.4, 
5
School nurses and pediatricians, 
both community- and school-based, 
working together can be a great 
example of team-based care, defined 
as the provision of comprehensive 
health services to individuals, 
families, and/or their communities 
by at least 2 health professionals 
who work collaboratively along 
with patients, family caregivers, 
and community service providers 
on shared goals within and across 
settings to achieve care that is 
safe, effective, patient-centered, 
timely, efficient, and equitable. The 
principles of team-based health 
care are as follows: shared goals, 
clear roles, mutual trust, effective 
communication, and measurable 
processes and outcomes.6, 
7 As a 
health care team member, school 
nurses connect students and their 
families to the medical home and can 
support coordination of care.8–10
As more children with special health 
care needs attend school, the school 
nurse plays a vital role in disease 
management, often working closely 
with children and their parents 
to reinforce the medical home’s 
recommendations and provide 
treatment(s) during the school day. 
Feedback mechanisms regarding 
student response to the treatment 
plan in school are critical to timely 
medical management in areas such 
as attention-deficit/hyperactivity 
disorder, diabetes, life-threatening 
allergies, asthma, and seizures as 
well as for the growing population 
of children with behavioral health 
concerns. School nurses play an 
important role in interpreting 
medical recommendations within 
the educational environment and, 
for example, may participate in 
the development of action plans 
for epilepsy management and 
safe transportation of a child with 
special health care needs.11, 
12 School 
nurses may also provide insight 
to a student’s pediatrician when 
attendance concerns, parental 
noncompliance with medical home 
goals, or even neglect or abuse is 
suspected. In addition, with increased 
awareness recently about such issues 
as head injuries, the school nurse is 
poised to offer on-site assessment 
of the student’s postconcussion 
progress and adaptations required in 
the educational plan.13
School nurses are also participants 
in public health arenas, such as 
immunization, obesity prevention, 
substance abuse assessment, tobacco 
control, and asthma education. Their 
daily presence in the school setting 
further augments and potentiates 
the pediatrician’s professional 
interventions with individual 
children and adolescents.14
Collaboration among pediatricians, 
families, school staff, school 
physicians, and school nurses is 
increasingly critical to optimal 
health care in both office and 
community settings. This policy 
statement describes the crucial 
aspects of the school nurse’s role, 
its relationship to pediatric practice, 
and recommendations to facilitate 
productive working relationships 
benefiting all school-aged children 
and adolescents. An important and 
more detailed reference for school 
health, School Health: Policy and 
Practice, provides a more in-depth 
description about health and schools, 
including a comprehensive chapter 
on school health services, including 
school nurses.15
BACKGROUND
During the past few decades, major 
legal, medical, and societal changes 
have critically influenced the need 
for registered professional nurses 
(hereafter referred to as school 
nurse) in the school setting.
Legal Changes
Social attitudes that promote 
inclusion, as well as state and federal 
laws such as the Individuals With 
Disabilities Act (Pub L No. 101-
476 [1990]) and section 504 of the 
Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Pub L No. 
93-112), specify disability rights and 
access to education, resulting in more 
children requiring and receiving 
nursing care and other health-related 
services in school.16, 
17
The Privacy, Security, and 
Breach Notification Rules of the 
Health Insurance Portability 
and Accountability Act of 1996 
(Pub L No. 104-191) and Family 
Educational Rights and Privacy 
Act (Pub L No. 93-380 [1974]) 
laws impose important privacy 
protections for a student’s health 
information. However, myths and 
misunderstanding among parents, 
pediatricians, and school nurses 
about these laws can inadvertently 
hinder efficient, efficacious, and 
cost-effective case management of 
student health care needs. School 
nurses work with parents to educate, 
facilitate, and expedite necessary 
communication between schools 
and the medical home. School nurses 
facilitate parental permissions for 
information exchange and serve as a 
link between parent and pediatrician 
to establish essential and effective 
individualized health care plans for 
students at school.

Medical Changes
Survival rates of preterm infants 
have increased to more than 80% of 
infants born at 26 weeks’ gestation 
and to more than 90% of infants born 
after 27 weeks’ gestation, resulting in 
an increase in the number of children 
with moderate to severe disabilities 
and learning or behavioral 
problems.18, 
19
Chronic illnesses also are on the rise. 
In 2010, 215 000 people younger 
than 20 years in the United States 
had a diagnosis of either type 1 or 
type 2 diabetes.20 The prevalence 
of food allergies among children 
younger than 18 years increased 
from 3.4% in 1997–1999 to 5.1% in 
2009–2011.21 An average of 1 in 10 
school-aged children has asthma, 
22 
contributing to more than 13 million 
missed school days per year.23 As 
the number of students with chronic 
conditions grows, the need for health 
care at school has increased.24 The 
rise in enrollment of students with 
special health care needs increases 
the need for school nurses and school 
health services.25
Caring for children with chronic 
conditions in schools requires 
registered professional school 
nurses. However, the reality is that 
school nurse staffing patterns vary 
widely across the United States.14 
When a school nurse is not available 
at all times, the American Academy of 
Pediatrics, the National Association 
of School Nurses, and the American 
Nurses Association recommend 
that delegated, unlicensed assistive 
personnel be trained and supervised 
in the knowledge, skills, and 
composure to deliver specific school 
health services under the guidance 
of a registered nurse. The delegation 
of nursing duties must be consistent 
with the requirements of state nurse 
practice acts, state regulations, and 
guidelines provided by professional 
nursing organizations.26 Delegation 
does not obviate the need for 
continued advocacy for full-time 
professional school nurses in each 
building. American Academy of 
Pediatrics’ policy has previously 
supported ratios of 1 school nurse 
to 750 students in the healthy 
student population and 1:225 for 
student populations requiring 
daily professional nursing services. 
However, the use of a ratio for 
workload determination in school 
nursing is inadequate to fill the 
increasingly complex health needs of 
students.27, 
28
Societal Changes
Families face multiple barriers to 
adequate health care, including 
accessibility, availability, and 
affordability. Many working parents 
also fear job loss if they are absent 
from work to attend a child’s medical 
appointment, forcing them to leave 
illnesses and chronic conditions 
unattended.29 The availability 
of school nurses to children and 
families helps to increase access to 
the medical home for comprehensive 
care as well as to essential 
public health functions, such as 
immunization or obesity prevention.
Schools and school nurses can 
partner with medical homes and 
public health agencies to increase 
access to or to deliver vaccines. 
The presence of registered nurses 
in schools is correlated with fewer 
immunization exemptions in 
schools.30 School nurses can improve 
vaccine uptake among students 
and staff by providing accurate 
information about vaccines. They can 
also remind students, families, and 
staff of immunization schedules and 
retrieve and update immunization 
records for state-specific reporting 
requirements.
Increasing rates of obesity over 
the past several decades represent 
alarming risks for the current 
and future health of children and 
adolescents. The percentage of 
children 6 to 11 years of age with 
obesity increased from 7% in 1980 to 
nearly 18% in 2012, with more than 
one-third of children now overweight 
or obese.31
The immediate and long-term 
effects on health range from 
cardiovascular disease and diabetes 
mellitus to social problems 
because of stigmatization.31 The 
school nurse, with his or her daily 
presence in school and access to 
large populations of students, is 
well positioned to prevent and/
or intervene on this health issue 
through (1) implementing BMI 
screenings and referrals to the 
medical home as needed, (2) 
collaborating with food service 
personnel and administrators 
to advocate for and to provide 
nutritional meals and snacks, 
(3) working with school staff to 
promote opportunities for physical 
activity, (4) educating parents about 
healthy lifestyles, and (5) involving 
the community providers and 
organizations in these efforts.
School-based health centers 
complement school nursing services 
by delivering a continuum of 
diagnostic and treatment services 
on-site and collaborating for 
prevention, early intervention, and 
harm-reduction services. To be most 
effective, school nurses and school-
based health center staff need to 
develop close communication and 
referral systems, similar to school 
nurses and any medical home.32
Another societal change is the 
increase in students identified with 
mental or behavioral health issues. 
One in five young people between the 
ages of 4 and 17 years experiences 
symptoms of minor to severe 
mental/behavioral health problems. 
One in ten children and adolescents 
has a mental illness severe enough to 
cause some level of impairment; yet, 
in any given year, only about 12% 
of children in need of mental health 
services actually receive them.33 
Pediatricians, both community- and 
school-based, and school nurses 
need to collaborate to advocate for 
professional resources addressing

this burgeoning problem that affects 
both their practices.9
Health care reform, including how 
health care is financed and delivered, 
is a significant societal change. In 
addition to improving quality of 
health care, cost containment is a 
major aim of health care reform. 
Working closely with parents, school 
staff, and community pediatricians, 
school nurses are well positioned to 
help contain costs. Initiatives such 
as chronic disease management, 
early detection of behavioral health 
issues, and obesity prevention are 
just a few examples of how school 
nurses contribute to significant cost 
savings for the health care system. 
There is growing evidence that full-
time school nurse staffing results in 
cost savings for society. In 1 study, 
for each dollar spent on school 
nurses, $2.20 was saved in parent 
loss of work time, teacher time, and 
procedures performed in school 
rather than in a more costly health 
care setting.34
Healthy Students Are Better 
Learners
Understanding the complex 
factors that lead to academic 
underachievement, poor school 
attendance, student drop out, and 
poor health outcomes is critical 
for the practicing community and 
school pediatrician, the educational 
community, and lawmakers alike. 
Physical and emotional health 
problems rank high among the 
factors contributing to chronic 
absenteeism (missing 10% or more 
of school days for any reason), 
a key risk factor for failing to 
complete school.35 Health-related 
problems contributing to academic 
underachievement are a primary 
responsibility of the medical home, 
the family, and the school health 
services team led by the school nurse 
in the health office on a daily basis. A 
growing body of research indicates 
that school nurses can improve 
attendance by reducing illness rates 
through education about preventive 
health care, early recognition 
of disease processes, improving 
chronic disease management, and 
increasing return-to-class rates.36 
Of the students seen by the school 
nurse for illness or injury, 95% were 
able to return to the classroom. 
Without a school nurse, unlicensed 
personnel who are uncertain what 
to do medically are at risk of sending 
children home from school or to the 
emergency department needlessly.37
The presence of a coordinated 
school health program, often led 
by school nurses, contributes to 
both educational achievement and 
the educational system.38 School 
nurses can provide key leadership 
in all the components of the Whole 
School, Whole Community, Whole 
Child model.39 Direct health services 
provided by a school nurse are linked 
to positive academic achievement. 
With a nurse in the school, other 
school staff, including teachers, divert 
less time from their primary job 
responsibilities to deal with student 
health issues.40
CONCLUSIONS
School nurses, working with pediatric 
patient-centered medical homes, 
school physicians, and families, are in 
a critical position to identify unmet 
health needs of large populations 
of children and adolescents in 
the school setting. Promoting the 
presence of a qualified school 
nurse in every school and a school 
physician in every district fosters the 
close interdependent relationship 
between health and education. 
Academic achievement, improved 
attendance, and better graduation 
rates can be a direct result of a 
coordinated team effort among the 
medical, family, and educational 
homes all recognizing that good 
health and strong education cannot 
be separated.
RECOMMENDATIONS
1. Pediatricians can advocate 
for a minimum of 1 full-time 
professional school nurse in every 
school with medical oversight 
from a school physician in every 
school district as the optimal 
staffing to ensure the health and 
safety of students during the 
school day.
2. Pediatricians can ask school-
related questions, including about 
health problems contributing to 
chronic absenteeism, at each visit 
and provide relevant information 
directly to the school. Electronic 
health records should include the 
name of the patient’s school and 
primary contact at the school. 
Health Information Exchange 
requirements, as defined in stage 
3 of Meaningful Use, should permit 
the direct exchange of school-
related information collected in 
the pediatrician’s office at each 
visit, including attendance and 
health problems contributing to 
absenteeism.
3. Pediatricians can establish 
a working relationship with 
school nurses to improve 
chronic condition management. 
Establishing an agreed-upon 
method of communication with 
the use of standardized forms 
and securing permission to 
exchange information are ways 
to facilitate this relationship. 
Communication and collaboration 
will also aid in the development of 
Individualized Health Care Plans, 
care coordination, and planning 
for transition from pediatric to 
adult health care.
4. Pediatricians can include school 
nurses as important team 
members in the delivery of health 
care for children and adolescents 
and in the design of integrated 
health systems, including school-
based health centers.
