Abstract
Opioids are routinely used analgesics in patients with chronic wounds; however the impact of 
opioid exposure on wound healing is poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to 
investigate the association between opioid exposure and wound outcome in the WE-HEAL study. 
This longitudinal observational study was conducted on 450 subjects enrolled in the WE-HEAL 
biorepository. Data were collected prospectively including baseline characteristics, pain score, 
longitudinal opioid exposure, and total wound surface area (tWSA). Data were analyzed using 
static multivariate models, fixed-effects mixed models, and time to event analysis. Using fixed-
effects models, opioid dose was significantly associated with tWSA after accounting for the effects 
of pain score and baseline co-variates (p<0.0001). For each 1-unit increase in ln(opioid dose+1) 
the ln(tWSA+1) increased by 0.16 units (95% CI 0.13–0.19, p<0.0001). Visits where opioids were 
present had ln(tWSA+1) 0.48 units larger (95% CI 0.38–0.58, p<0.0001) than visits with no opioid 
exposure. Using time-to-event analysis, patients who never received opioids healed faster than 
those who received opioids (log-rank Chi-square 11.00, p 0.0009). Using Cox regression analysis, 
patients with mean opioid dose ≥10mg were significantly less likely to heal than those with no 
opioid (HR 0.67 [0.49–0.91], p 0.011) after adjusting for wound size. Patients with opioid dose >0 
to <10mg had a similar hazard of not healing as those with no opioid exposure (HR 0.88 [0.65–
1.19], p=0.40). In conclusion, opioid analgesics are commonly prescribed to patients with chronic 
wounds; however, the data presented suggest that opioid exposure is associated with reduced 
likelihood of healing in patients with chronic wounds. Whether this is a causal relationship will 
require further study.

INTRODUCTION
Chronic wounds that have failed to heal after 3 months of appropriate wound care affect 
approximately 6.5 million people in the US with a prevalence of 1% and costs estimated at 
$25 billion per year (1). In addition to the financial costs, these wounds significantly impact 
mortality (2) and cause considerable pain, affecting patient reported psychosocial well-being 
and quality of life (3, 4).
Recalcitrant wounds are often arrested in the inflammatory phase (1, 5–9). Transition of 
wounds to the healing phase is marked clinically by a dramatic improvement in wound-
related pain; however, the molecular mechanisms driving this are not well understood, and it 
is not known whether more aggressive analgesic management could improve healing 
outcomes. The pain associated with chronic wounds has been postulated to be related to the 
stimulation of nociceptors by the complex inflammatory milieu in the wound 
microenvironment(10). Molecular studies investigating keratinocyte biology and wound 
healing have shown that functionally active μ-opiate receptors are present on human 
keratinocytes(11). Activation of these receptors by the μ-opiate receptor agonist β-endorphin 
in cultured keratinocytes results in upregulation of the type II transforming growth factor-β 
(TGF-β) receptor and cytokeratin 16 (CK16)(12). The type II TGF-β receptor plays an 
important role in wound healing; it is expressed in regenerating epithelial cells in acute 
wounds and in epithelial cells at the margin of chronic wounds. CK16 is a filament protein 
that is not expressed in normal skin, but appears in the suprabasal compartment of the 
epidermis during wound healing and in hyperproliferative skin disorders such as 
psoriasis(13). Additional experiments using cultured keratinocytes show that the CK16 
response can be blocked by incubation together with the μ-opiate receptor antagonist 
naltrexone(11, 12, 14). This finding suggests that hypothetically the clinical use of opioids 
for patients with chronic wounds might be beneficial in upregulating molecular pathways 
contributing to wound healing and may be associated with improved clinical outcomes.
Other studies have suggested that opioid use may negatively impact wound healing, by 
reducing immune activation, impacting tissue oxygenation and angiogenesis(15, 16) and 
altering myofibroblast recruitment as well as impacting keratinocyte cytokine production, 
endothelial proliferation and angiogenesis(15–17). In contrast however, untreated pain can 
also impact wound healing since it potentially impacts tissue perfusion and oxygenation(18, 
19) and may interfere with proper wound care, debridement and dressing changes(20).
The purpose of this project was to use data collected through the Wound Etiology and 
Healing (WE-HEAL) study to investigate the relationship between patient reported pain, 
opioid exposure and wound outcome in the clinical care of a longitudinal cohort of patients 
with chronic wounds.

 METHODS
Setting and Population
The Wound Healing and Etiology (WE-HEAL) Study (IRB 041408, NCT 01352078) is a 
prospective biospecimen and data repository that recruits subjects with chronic wounds 
followed at tertiary referral centers focused on the management of patients with chronic 
wounds.
Cohort selection
The present analysis was conducted utilizing data from the WE-HEAL subjects who had an 
open wound at the initial visit, and had more than 1 follow-up visit available for analysis at 
the time of data abstraction.
Data management for WE-HEAL study
Longitudinal clinical and wound outcome data for the WE-HEAL study were abstracted 
from the clinical medical record and stored using REDCap(21).
Demographic data, baseline medical comorbidities (including diabetes, autoimmune disease, 
cardiovascular and renal disease, and smoking exposure), and laboratory data were 
abstracted from the EHR into the WE-HEAL database at enrollment. Clinical follow-up data 
were collected at each clinic visit, including wound surface area, wound specific 
interventions and medication exposures.
Wound Surface Area Assessment—Wound surface area (WSA) was calculated at 
every visit for each wound using the formula: maximum width × maximum length (cm2). 
For the purposes of the present analysis, if multiple wounds were present in a single patient 
on any given clinical visit, the total surface area (tWSA) of wounds was computed by 
summing the WSA for all wounds.
Pain Score Evaluation—Numerical pain score based on a verbal scale of pain (0–10 with 
0 being no pain and 10 being worst pain ever) was collected from every patient, prior to 
removing dressings, during every clinical interaction. This is a valid and reproducible score 
that is in routine clinical use (22), and thus is a clinically relevant measure in this analysis. 
Baseline pain score was used as a covariate in the static multivariate models and time-to-
event analyses. Pain was a time-varying covariate in the fixed-effects mixed models. This 
means that for each time point where wound size was measured, pain was also measured, 
and was controlled for in the analysis.
Opiate Exposure Calculation—Following each clinic visit, after completion of the 
medication reconciliation process by the clinical team, data on all prescribed opioids 
(including oral, topical and intravenous agents) was abstracted into the WE-HEAL Study 
database. Since medication reconciliation is a metric which is tracked and audited through 
the EHR, we are confident that it is completed at every clinical interaction. Any 
discrepancies were resolved by adjudication by two investigators (SM and VKS).

 Each individual’s daily morphine-equivalent exposure was determined by first calculating 
the quantity of opioid medication dispensed by the milligram strength per dosage unit 
dispensed, then multiplying by the published opioid-specific morphine-equivalent 
conversion factor (23–25). Total daily opioid dose was calculated by dividing the morphine-
equivalent dose per dispensing by the number of days supply dispensed. If opioids from 
multiple dispensings were ordered on the same day, morphine-equivalent doses were 
summed. Analysis was conducted using this opioid-equivalent dose per 24 hours, hereafter 
referred to as opioid dose.
Statistical Analysis
Data distributions were examined for outliers or non-normality. Since wound size and opioid 
dose were both strongly positively skewed, both were log-transformed prior to analysis, 
using Ln(x+1) to normalize the distribution. Parametric statistics could then be used to 
assess their association with other variables.
Opioid treatment, degree of pain, and wound size were expected to be correlated. Patients 
with larger wounds are expected to have more pain and to be more likely to receive opioids 
at higher doses, but those with larger wounds may also be less likely to heal. Thus, teasing 
out the causal effects of opioid treatment on healing was expected to be challenging. We 
used several statistical methods to try to address this issue. Data analytic methods used in 
this paper include a) Univariate association of healing status with opioid treatment and other 
baseline differences, b) Static multivariate logistic regression models which adjust the 
opioid-healing association for baseline differences (i.e. for possible confounds), c) Time-to-
event analyses, including Kaplan-Meier analysis which accounts for time at risk, and Cox 
regression which adjusts the time-to-event results for baseline differences, and finally e) 
Dynamic fixed-effects mixed model regression. This last method, which may be unfamiliar 
to readers, goes beyond static multiple regression approaches, by using each subject’s 
changing wound size and pain as time-varying predictors, examining differences in wound 
size over time within patients, as a function of previous wound size, current opioid treatment 
and pain, at each time point, using each subject as his or her own control. This method 
addresses the question of whether change in opioid treatment over time within subjects, is 
associated with change in wound size, while controlling for each subject’s time-varying 
wound size at the previous visit, and current pain, and for all the relevant static baseline 
covariates.
Univariate analysis—Baseline differences between patients who had ever, versus never 
received opioids, as well as between final healing status groups were examined using chi-
square or Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables and between-group t-tests for 
continuous variables. Healing groups were defined as follows:
1.
Never-Healed: Patients who never attainted tWSA=0
2.
Once-Healed: Patients who attained tWSA=0 on at least one measurement 
period, but not at their final measurement period
3.
Final-Healed: Patients with tWSA=0 at their final measurement period

Ever-Healed: Combined group of both the final- and once-healed groups
Static multivariate models were used to examine predictors of healing status using logistic 
regression with the following binary dependent variables: a) Final-healed vs. once + never-
healed; and b) Never-healed vs. ever-healed.
Time-to-event analysis—Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to examine time to healing 
(first visit when total wound size=0), stratified by a) whether or not the patient ever received 
opioids and b) opioid dose based on 3-level ordinal variable outlined above. For this 
analysis, patients who never achieved total wound size of zero were censored on their last 
date observed. Finally, Cox regression was used to analyze time to first healing adjusting for 
baseline differences between groups, using the same stratified opioid variables as well as a 
continuous log-transformed opioid dose as predictors. In order to test whether the 
association of opioid dose with time to healing differed at different levels of baseline pain, 
an opioid by pain interaction term was added to these models.
Dynamic models—Fixed-effects mixed model regression was used to test several models 
predicting variation in tWSA over time, including time-varying covariates for wound size, 
pain and opioid dose, as well as static covariates (baseline variables that were associated 
with opioid use with p<0.10). Each subject in this analysis is used as his or her own control, 
and the model accounts for within-subject auto-correlation of wound size by nesting 
observations within subjects. Fixed-effects mixed models were tested for the time-varying 
outcome variables tWSA and % change in wound size per week. Measures of opioid dose 
used in these models included a binary indicator variable (ever vs. never exposed), and a 3-
level ordinal variable (0mg, >0 to <10mg, >10mg mean daily opioid equivalent dose). The 
dose effect in these analyses is interpreted as the impact of morphine dose change within 
subjects, adjusted for previous wound size, pain, and baseline covariates.
Power—We conducted post-hoc power analysis using simulations in order to determine the 
effect size (i.e, the association between opioid exposure and wound size). We generated 
1000 simulated data sets in which we preserved the multivariate associations between the 
covariates and the auto-correlation within subjects, by using the actual data, but created 
increasing levels of randomness in the opioid exposure variable, so that we could test our 
power as the effect size dropped. The strength of the observed univariate association 
between the exposure variable (3-level ordinal opioid dose) and the outcome (natural log of 
wound size), across all subjects and time points, was approximated using the R2 as an 
approximation of the effect size. A fixed-effects mixed model was run on each simulated 
data set (adjusted for time, pain, last wound size, race, lymphedema, illicit drug use, 
pulmonary hypertension, sickle cell disease, and alcohol use), the p-value for the 
randomized opioid exposure variable predicting wound size was saved, and the distribution 
of these p-values across the 1000 simulations was used to determine power.
Statistical analysis was conducted using SAS software, version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, 
NC). A two-sided P value of less than 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical 
significance.

RESULTS
Characteristics of the patients
Of the 450 patients enrolled in the WE-HEAL study at the time of data export, 445 had at 
least one follow-up visit and were eligible for inclusion in the current analysis (Figure 1). 
Mean age was 61.0 ± 14.6, 49% were female, 34% were African American and 65% 
Caucasian. 329 patients (73.9%) received opioids at some point during follow-up (Table 1). 
Patients receiving opioids were more likely to be African American, to have used illicit 
drugs currently or in the past, and to have lymphedema, compared to those who never 
received opioids. Of the 445 patients, 115 were never-healed, 76 were once-healed, and 254 
were final-healed. The ever-healed group combined the once-healed and final healed group 
(these patients had achieved tWSA=0 at least temporarily) and thus included 330 patients 
(74.2%).
Univariate association with healed status
Univariate predictors of the final-healed group included Caucasian race, not having illicit 
drug use and moderate alcohol use (Table 2A). Final-healed status was negatively associated 
with venous disease, lymphedema, sickle cell disease, neurologic disorder (Table 2A). 
Never-healed was associated with African American race, prior or current illicit drug use, 
lymphedema, prothrombotic states, and sickle cell disease in the univariate analysis (Table 
2B). In patients who ever had opioids, 19% were once-healed, 56% were final-healed, and 
25% were never-healed. In patients who never had opioids, 10% were once-healed, 61% 
were final-healed and 28% were never-healed. In this univariate analysis there was no 
significant difference between the never and ever opioid users (p=0.08).
STATIC MULTIVARIATE MODELS
Predicting never-healed status (versus ever-healed)—The association of log-
transformed mean opioid dose with never-healed status was not significant (OR 1.05 [95% 
CI 0.92–1.20, p=0.46). The only predictor included in the final model predicting never-
healed status was log of baseline tWSA. Each 1 unit increase in ln(baseline tWSA+1) was 
associated with a 38% increase in the odds of never-healing (OR 1.39 [1.22–1.59], 
p<0.0001). Translating into the units of cm2, a 1-unit increase in ln(baseline tWSA+1) 
would be equivalent to the difference between 1 and 4.44cm2 or 50 and 137.7cm2.

 Predicting final-healed status—Mean opioid dose was not significantly associated with 
final-healed status (OR 0.99 [0.88–1.12], p=0.90). Predictors that were independently 
associated with final-healed status included Hidradenitis Suppurativa (OR 2.63 [1.04–6.65], 
p=0.04) and lymphedema (OR 0.32 [0.15–0.69], p=0.0036). Sickle cell disease (OR 0.22 
[0.05–1.11, p=0.067) and first visit tWSA (OR 0.90 [0.79–1.01], p=0.071) did not reach 
statistical significance.
TIME-TO-EVENT ANALYSIS
Kaplan-Meier—In this analysis the outcome of interest was time-to-healing defined by 
first occurrence of tWSA= 0. Stratified by the binary variable of opioid exposure, patients 
who never received opioids healed faster than those who received opioids (log rank chi-
square 11.00, p=0.0009, Figure 2). Separation in the survival curves is clear at 26 weeks, 
with 36.2% patients not healed in the non-opioid exposed group (95% CI 26.2–46.3%) and 
49.4% not healed in the opioid-exposed group (95% CI 43.4–55.4%, p=0.006).
Stratifying by opioid dose into 0mg, <10mg and >10mg groups the log-rank chi-square was 
19.77 (p<0.0001). Patients who were never exposed to opioids healed faster than those who 
received mean daily opioid equivalent doses of <10mg per day. Patients who received 
≥10mg equivalent dosing per day healed slowest. The estimated percent of patients non-
healed by 27 weeks was 36.2% (26.2–46.3%) in the 0mg dose group, 42.9% (34.0–51.8%) 
in the <10mg daily opioid equivalent dose group and 54.0% (45.9–62.0%) in the patients 
with >10mg daily opioid equivalent dose (p=0.01). However, baseline opioid dose was 
positively associated with both baseline wound size and pain level, so it was necessary to 
adjust for these, and for other relevant covariates in order to obtain an estimate of the 
independent effect of opioids on healing.
Cox regression—After adjusting for baseline tWSA (log-transformed), pain level, 
lymphedema, illicit drug use, and sickle cell disease, opioid dose was significantly 
associated with reduced likelihood of healing (HR 0.71 [0.53–0.94], p=0.019). Using the 
categorical opioid indicator, patients with mean opioid dose ≥10mg were significantly less 
likely to heal than those with no opioid (HR 0.60 [0.43–0.83], p=0.0024). Patients with 
opioid dose >0 to <10mg equivalent did not have a different hazard of not healing than those 
with no opioid (HR 0.82 [0.60–1.13], p=0.23) (Figure 3). The pain by opioid interaction 
terms were not significant, either in the model using the binary opioid indicator variable (p=.
19) or the 3-level ordinal opioid dose variable (p=.32), indicating that the opioid association 
with time to first healing did not differ by baseline pain level.
DYNAMIC MULTIVARIATE MODELS
The first set of fixed-effects models used pain score and opioid dose as time-varying 
predictors of wound size. We used three different ways of coding the current opioid dose: a 
log-transformed continuous variable, a binary indicator, and a 3-level ordinal variable. In 
these models, the effects of the time-varying predictors are adjusted for the static (baseline) 
covariates: race, lymphedema, illicit drug use, pulmonary hypertension, sickle cell disease, 
alcohol use and baseline wound size.

 Prediction of tWSA using time-varying opioid dose—After adjusting for the static 
variables, effects were estimated for time-varying predictors: pain score and log of visit 
opioid dose. The overall model was significant (F=14.44, p<0.0001) with 59% of the wound 
size variance coming from between-patient differences and the rest from within-patient 
differences. Opioid dose was significantly associated with wound size after accounting for 
the effects of pain score and baseline covariates (p<0.0001). For each 1-unit increase in 
Ln(opioid dose+1) between visits, Ln (tWSA+1) increased by 0.16 units (95% CI 0.13–0.19, 
p<0.0001). Translating this back into the original units of measurement, a 1-unit increase in 
Ln(opioid dose+1) would be equivalent to an opioid dose increase of 0 to 1.72mg or 10 to 
28.8mg. A Ln(tWSA+1) increase of 0.16 units would be equivalent to a wound size increase 
of 0 to 0.175 cm2 or 10 to 11.9 cm2. Pain was also significantly associated with wound size: 
each 1-unit increase in the pain score was associated with a 0.09 log-unit increase in wound 
size (95% CI 0.07 to 0.10, p<0.0001), which is equivalent to a change from 0 to 0.094cm2 or 
10 to 11cm2.
Prediction of tWSA Using Time-Varying Binary Opioid Indicator—The overall 
model was significant (F = 14.39, p<0.0001) with 58% of total wound size variance 
between-subjects and the rest within-subjects. Visits where opioids were present had 
Ln(tWSA + 1) 0.48 units larger (95% CI 0.38–0.58; p<0.0001) than visits when there was 
no opioid present. This is equivalent to an increase in tWSA from 0–0.62 cm2 or from 10 to 
16.8 cm2. Pain remained significantly associated with wound size. Each 1-unit increase in 
pain score was associated with an increase in wound size of 0.09 log-units (95% CI 0.08–
0.11, p<0.0001). This is equivalent to a change from 0 to 0.094 cm2 or from 10 to 11 cm2.
Prediction of tWSA using time-varying ordinal opioid dose variable—With 
current opioid dose coded as a 3-level ordinal variable (0, >0 to <10mg, or >10mg), the fixed 
effects model was significant (F=14.39, p<0.0001) with 59% of the wound size variance 
between-subjects. Visits where opioid equivalent dose was >0 to <10mg had wound size 
0.35 log units larger (95% CI 0.22 to 0.49, p<0.0001) than those with no opioid present. 
Visits with opioid equivalent dose ≥10mg had wound size 0.56 log units larger than visits 
with no opioid present (95% CI 0.45 to 0.68, p<0.0001). A 0.35 log unit increase is 
equivalent to a change from 0 to 0.42 cm2 or 10 to 14.6 cm2. A 0.56 log unit increase is 
equivalent to a change from 0 to 0.75 cm2 or 10 to 18.3 cm2. For each 1-unit increase in the 
last visit’s pain score, wound size increased by 0.09 log units (95% CI 0.08 to 0.10, 
p<0.0001), which is equivalent to an increase from 0 to 0.094 cm2 or 10 to 11cm2.
Since the three methods for coding opioid equivalent dose produced similar results, only the 
3-level ordinal coding results are presented for the remaining fixed-effects models.
Prediction of percent-change in tWSA—The model was significant (F=1.56, 
p<0.0001) with 16% of the variance between-subjects. Opioid dose was not significantly 
associated with percent-change in tWSA (p=0.90 for >0 to <10 mg, and p=0.13 for ≥10mg, 
versus no opioid). Pain score was not associated with percent-change in tWSA (p=0.07). 
Each 1-point increase in pain was associated with 14% increase in tWSA (95% CI −1% to 
+29%).

 Prediction of current tWSA controlling for previous visit tWSA—In this model 
log-transformed tWSA from the previous visit is used as a time-varying covariate, rather 
than using a static baseline tWSA adjustment variable. The model was significant (F=18.60, 
p<0.0001) with 71% of the variance between-subjects. Visits where opioid dose was >0 to 
<10mg had wound size 0.18 log units larger (95% CI 0.06 to 0.30 units, p=0.0025) than if 
opioid was absent. Visits where opioid equivalent dose was >10mg had wound size 0.32 log 
units larger than if opioids were absent (95% CI, 0.22 to 0.42 units, p<0.0001). An increase 
of 0.18 log units is equivalent to an increase from 0 to 0.2 cm2 or 10 to 12.2 cm2. An 
increase of 0.32 log units is equivalent to an increase from 0 to 0.38 cm2 or 10 to 14.2 cm2. 
Each 1-point increase in pain score was associated with an increase of 0.06 log units in 
current wound size (95% CI 0.05 to 0.08 units, p<0.0001), which is equivalent to an increase 
from 0 cm2 to 0.065 cm2 or 10 to 10.7 cm2. Each 1 log unit increase in the last visit tWSA 
was associated with a 0.51 log unit increase in current wound size (95% CI 0.49 to 0.54, 
p<0.0001).
POST-HOC EMPIRICAL POWER ANALYSIS
The R2 was .081 in the actual data set. In our first set of 1000 simulated data sets the mean 
R2 across simulations was .062 (95% confidence interval.0617–.0621). Even when we 
required alpha=.01 for significance, we had power = .994 (exact 95% confidence limits .987 
– .998) to detect this effect. We then reduced the effect size further, by allowing for more 
random variation in the ordinal morphine variable in another set of 1000 simulated data sets, 
such that the mean R2 across the second set of 1000 simulations was .053 (95% ci .0528–.
0533). Again, using alpha=.01, in this second set of simulations, we still had power of .91 
(exact 95% confidence limits .894–.930) to detect an effect of opioid dose on wound size 
across time, after adjusting for wound size at the previous time point, current level of pain, 
and baseline covariates in a fixed effects mixed model.
DISCUSSION
In patients with chronic wounds, after controlling for confounders including baseline tWSA, 
medical comorbidities and pain score, opioid exposure was associated with delayed healing. 
These findings corroborate observations at a cellular and molecular level that opioid 
exposure may impact keratinocyte biology and wound healing. This data also adds weight to 
the observation in a large retrospective study investigating risk factors for post-operative 
wound dehiscence, that opioid exposure in the postoperative period was associated with 
post-operative wound dehiscence(26).
Other smaller animal based studies have suggested the opioids may enhance collagen 
deposition and thus tensile strength in incisional wounds(27). However acute incisional 
wounds studied in that experiment are biologically distinct from the chronic wounds being 
investigated in the WE-HEAL study and these differences likely account for the absence of 
beneficial effect seen with opioid exposure in the WE-HEAL cohort.
Findings of this study have important implications for clinical care of patients with chronic 
wounds, since patients with substantial wound-related pain are frequently prescribed 
opioids. The data presented here suggest that opioid exposure may adversely impact ultimate

 wound healing and increase time to healing. There is a continued clinical need to better 
understand the impact of opioid exposure on wound healing at a cellular and molecular 
level.
This study does have some limitations which merit discussion. Firstly, higher pain likely 
contributed to higher opioid exposure in patients with refractory wounds. Conditions that 
were associated with poor outcomes in this study such as lymphedema, sickle cell disease 
and hidradenitis are known to also be associated with painful wounds which may have been 
a confounder. There may have been other confounds that we did not measure or control for. 
While our multivariate models controlled for confounds such as wound size and pain, and 
our fixed effects model further reduced the possible effects of reverse-causation, the only 
way to truly test the causal effect of opiate use or dosage on wound healing would be to 
randomly vary these interventions in a prospective experiment. Such an experiment would 
be ethically impossible to undertake in human patients; therefore retrospective data may be 
the only type of data we will ever have in a clinical sample. The impact of opioids on 
keratinocyte biology can be studied using in vitro systems and experiments to further 
investigate this effect at a cellular level are planned.
Investigations of chronic and acute wound specimens show significantly decreased 
expression of μ-opiate receptors on keratinocytes at the margin of chronic compared to acute 
wounds(28), suggesting that differential expression of opiate receptors may be important in 
molecular mechanisms that may contribute to delayed wound healing. Cutaneous activation 
of the opioid system especially in inflamed and damaged skin can influence cell 
differentiation and apoptosis, and thus may be important in the mechanisms of skin 
repair(29). To better understand the molecular mechanisms driving the observed association 
of opioid exposure and delayed wound healing, we intend to correlate the opiate exposure 
and clinical outcome data with tissue mRNA expression array data which should allow 
correlation of clinical data with molecular pathways of opiate action.
A second important limitation is that wound etiologies differed across patients in this study, 
and it is possible that wound size and level of pain as well as the effect of opioids on healing 
might vary with wound etiology. This possibility should be further investigated.
A third limitation is that medication records rather than patient diaries were used to assess 
medication exposure. Since clinicians are required to reconcile the medication list at every 
clinical interaction, and internal audits show good compliance with this process we believe 
that the medication records are an accurate representation of opioid prescribing in this study. 
Alternative methods to confirm compliance, such as pill diaries or therapeutic levels, would 
not be feasible in this clinical population, but might be appropriate if a prospective clinical 
trial investigating opiate use in wound healing was planned. It is possible those patients in 
the study did not comply with all prescribed opioid treatment, or that they had additional 
opioids from outside the study. However, reduced compliance or outside medications would 
tend to reduce the observed correlation between opioid treatment and healing, rather than 
increase it, so, to the extent that poor compliance or outside medication use occurred, the 
relationship between opioid use and reduced healing would actually be stronger than that 
observed in this study.

 CONCLUSIONS
In conclusion, we found that patients in the WE-HEAL study who never received opioids 
healed faster than those who received opioids. Opioid exposure was a strong predictor of 
wound size and patients who received opioids at doses above 10mg per day had slower rates 
of healing than those with no exposure or dosing less than 10mg per day.

final healing: race, alcohol, illicit drug use, venous disease, lymphedema, sickle cell disease, neurological 
disorder, pulmonary hypertension, hidradenitis supportiva. Stepwise inclusion was used with p<.10 required 
for model entry and exit (i.e. variables not listed in the table were not associated with final healing, p>.10), 
except that opioid dose was retained in the model regardless of its p-value.
