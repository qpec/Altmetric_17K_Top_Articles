 CONSORT-EHEALTH (V 1.6.1) -
Submission/Publication Form
The CONSORT-EHEALTH checklist is intended for authors of randomized trials evaluating 
web-based and Internet-based applications/interventions, including mobile interventions, 
electronic games (incl multiplayer games), social media, certain telehealth applications, and 
other interactive and/or networked electronic applications. Some of the items (e.g. all 
subitems under item 5 - description of the intervention) may also be applicable for other study 
designs.
The goal of the CONSORT EHEALTH checklist and guideline is to be 
a) a guide for reporting for authors of RCTs, 
b) to form a basis for appraisal of an ehealth trial (in terms of validity)
CONSORT-EHEALTH items/subitems are MANDATORY reporting items for studies published in 
the Journal of Medical Internet Research and other journals / scientiUc societies endorsing the 
checklist.
Items numbered 1., 2., 3., 4a., 4b etc are original CONSORT or CONSORT-NPT 
(non-pharmacologic treatment) items. 
Items with Roman numerals (i., ii, iii, iv etc.) are CONSORT-EHEALTH extensions/clariUcations.
As the CONSORT-EHEALTH checklist is still considered in a formative stage, we would ask that 
you also RATE ON A SCALE OF 1-5 how important/useful you feel each item is FOR THE 
PURPOSE OF THE CHECKLIST and reporting guideline (optional).
Mandatory reporting items are marked with a red *. 
In the textboxes, either copy & paste the relevant sections from your manuscript into this form - 
please include any quotes from your manuscript in QUOTATION MARKS, 
or answer directly by providing additional information not in the manuscript, or elaborating on 
why the item was not relevant for this study. 
YOUR ANSWERS WILL BE PUBLISHED AS  A SUPPLEMENTARY FILE TO YOUR PUBLICATION 
IN JMIR AND ARE CONSIDERED PART OF YOUR PUBLICATION (IF ACCEPTED). 
Please Ull in these questions diligently. Information will not be copyedited, so please use 
proper spelling and grammar, use correct capitalization, and avoid abbreviations.

TITLE AND ABSTRACT
1a) TITLE: IdentiUcation as a randomized trial in the title
1a) Does your paper address CONSORT item 1a? *
I.e does the title contain the phrase "Randomized Controlled Trial"? (if not, explain the reason under
"other")
yes
Other:
1a-i) Identify the mode of delivery in the title
Identify the mode of delivery. Preferably use “web-based” and/or “mobile” and/or “electronic game” in
the title. Avoid ambiguous terms like “online”, “virtual”, “interactive”. Use “Internet-based” only if
Intervention includes non-web-based Internet components (e.g. email), use “computer-based” or
“electronic” only if ooine products are used. Use “virtual” only in the context of “virtual reality” (3-D
worlds). Use “online” only in the context of “online support groups”. Complement or substitute product
names with broader terms for the class of products (such as “mobile” or “smart phone” instead of
“iphone”), especially if the application runs on different platforms.

 While our videogame intervention was developed on the iPad and 
therefore, is a "mobile" game, it has also been translated to Mac and PC 
and therefore, it being mobile is not critical. I think the term "videogame" 
indicates an "electronic game"
1a-ii) Non-web-based components or important co-interventions in title

1b-iii) Open vs. closed, web-based (self-assessment) vs. face-to-face assessments in the
METHODS section of the ABSTRACT
Mention how participants were recruited (online vs. ooine), e.g., from an open access website or from
a clinic or a closed online user group (closed usergroup trial), and clarify if this was a purely web-based
trial, or there were face-to-face components (as part of the intervention or for assessment). Clearly say
if outcomes were self-assessed through questionnaires (as common in web-based trials). Note: In
traditional ooine trials, an open trial (open-label trial) is a type of clinical trial in which both the
researchers and participants know which treatment is being administered. To avoid confusion, use
“blinded” or “unblinded” to indicated the level of blinding instead of “open”, as “open” in web-based trials
usually refers to “open access” (i.e. participants can self-enrol). (Note: Only report in the abstract what
the main paper is reporting. If this information is missing from the main body of text, consider adding it)

"Three hundred and thirty-three racial/ethnic minority adolescents, aged 
11-14 years from 12 community after-school, school and summer 
programs. Assessments were conducted at six weeks, three, six and 12 
months. Primary outcome was delay of initiation of vaginal/anal 
intercourse. Secondary outcomes included sexual health attitudes, 
knowledge, and intentions. We examined outcomes by gender and age.
Results: Three hundred and thirty-three participants were randomized to 
play the intervention (n=166) or control games (n=167): 90% were 
racial/ethnic minorities, 53% were boys, and the mean age was 13 
1b-v) CONCLUSIONS/DISCUSSION in abstract for negative trials
Conclusions/Discussions in abstract for negative trials: Discuss the primary outcome - if the trial is
negative (primary outcome not changed), and the intervention was not used, discuss whether negative
results are attributable to lack of uptake and discuss reasons. (Note: Only report in the abstract what

The abstract discusses the findings. The MS goes into more details 
about the fact that the event rate was low and that made it difficult to 
assess the primary outcome.

"Participants played PlayForward or a set of control games on the iPad. 
PlayForward is a two-dimensional, role-playing adventure videogame 
[25-29], developed using a theoretical foundation [28, 34-37] about how 
choices in life impact both short-term and long-term goals. The game 
consists of approximately 16 hours of gameplay. The players’ goal is to

Yes. There was some discussion of the fact that this is a stand-alone

"PlayForward offers potential implementation advantages over other 
school-based interventions as it does not involve intensive training 
requiring significant human and financial resources, and it provides a 
level of fidelity in the delivery of content. "

"While we adhered to standards regarding evaluating behavioral 
interventions [67], some limitations of the current study must be 
considered. The low rate of initiation of sexual intercourse precluded us 
from determining PlayForward’s impact on the primary outcome at 12 
months. These low rates are consistent with current national figures [68] 
with four percent of high school students reporting sexual intercourse 
before age 13, increasing to 24% by 9th grade (~ 15 years). Therefore,

"While we studied a population of racial/ethnic minority adolescents
