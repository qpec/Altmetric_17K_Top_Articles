Abstract
The blacklegged tick, Ixodes scapularis Say, is the primary vector to humans in the eastern United States of the
Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, as well as causative agents of anaplasmosis and babesiosis. Its
close relative in the far western United States, the western blacklegged tick Ixodes pacificus Cooley and Kohls,
is the primary vector to humans in that region of the Lyme disease and anaplasmosis agents. Since 1991, when
standardized surveillance and reporting began, Lyme disease case counts have increased steadily in number
and in geographical distribution in the eastern United States. Similar trends have been observed for anaplasmo-
sis and babesiosis. To better understand the changing landscape of risk of human exposure to disease agents
transmitted by I. scapularis and I. pacificus, and to document changes in their recorded distribution over the
past two decades, we updated the distribution of these species from a map published in 1998. The presence of
I. scapularis has now been documented from 1,420 (45.7%) of the 3,110 continental United States counties, as
compared with 111 (3.6%) counties for I. pacificus. Combined, these vectors of B. burgdorferi and other disease
agents now have been identified in a total of 1,531 (49.2%) counties spread across 43 states. This marks a 44.7%
increase in the number of counties that have recorded the presence of these ticks since the previous map was
presented in 1998, when 1,058 counties in 41 states reported the ticks to be present. Notably, the number of
counties in which I. scapularis is considered established (six or more individuals or one or more life stages iden-
tified in a single year) has more than doubled since the previous national distribution map was published nearly
two decades ago. The majority of county status changes occurred in the North-Central and Northeastern states,
whereas the distribution in the South remained fairly stable. Two previously distinct foci for I. scapularis in the
Northeast and North-Central states appear to be merging in the Ohio River Valley to form a single contiguous
focus. Here we document a shifting landscape of risk for human exposure to medically important ticks and point
to areas of re-emergence where enhanced vector surveillance and control may be warranted.
Key words: Ixodes scapularis, Ixodes pacificus, distribution, Lyme disease
The blacklegged tick, Ixodes scapularis Say, is the primary vector to
humans in the eastern United States of the Lyme disease spirochete
Borrelia burgdorferi, as well as the relapsing fever spirochete,
Borrelia miyamotoi; causative agents of anaplasmosis (Anaplasma
phagocytophilum) and babesiosis (Babesia microti); and Powassan
encephalitis virus (Piesman and Eisen 2008, Ebel 2010, Krause et al.
2015). Its close relative in the far western United States, the western
blacklegged tick Ixodes pacificus Cooley and Kohls, is the primary
vector to humans in that region of Lyme disease and anaplasmosis
agents, as well as relapsing fever spirochetes (B. miyamotoi; Lane
et al. 1994, Teglas and Foley 2006, Krause et al. 2015). Lyme dis-
ease is the most commonly reported vector-borne disease in the
United States. It is a geographically focal illness, with the majority
of cases reported from the Northeastern and North-Central states
and discrete areas of risk in the Pacific Coast states (Mead 2015).
Since 1991, when standardized surveillance and reporting began,
Lyme disease case counts have increased steadily from roughly
10,000 cases in 1991 to more than 30,000 cases in 2008 and subse-
quent years (Bacon et al. 2008, Mead 2015); the true burden of dis-
ease is estimated to be roughly 10-fold greater (Hinckley et al. 2014,
Nelson et al. 2015). In addition to the increase in case counts over
time, the geographical foci of high-incidence counties have ex-
panded both in the North-Central and in the Northeastern United
States (Kugeler et al. 2015).
Rising case counts and geographical expansion of Lyme disease
endemic areas have been attributed to range expansion of I. scapula-
ris in the eastern United States (Bacon et al. 2008, Rydzewski et al.
2012, Lee et al. 2013, Brinkerhoff et al. 2014, Robinson et al. 2014,

 Wang et al. 2014, Khatchikian et al. 2015, Kugeler et al. 2015,
Stone et al. 2015). However, because of a lack of systematic surveil-
lance of I. scapularis and I. pacificus, national trends in the geo-
graphic distribution of these medically important ticks are difficult
to document. To better understand the changing landscape of risk of
human exposure to I. scapularis and I. pacificus in the United States,
and to document changes in their distribution over the past two de-
cades, we updated the reported distribution of these species from the
map previously published by Dennis et al. (1998).
Materials and Methods
County Status Definitions
The definitions used to classify I. scapularis or I. pacificus as “estab-
lished” or “reported” in a county follow Dennis et al. (1998).
Counties were classified as established if at least six individual ticks
or at least two of the three host-seeking life stages had been identi-
fied in a single collection period. Here, a single collection period is
defined as a single year. Counties were classified as reported if they
failed to meet the criteria for established but if at least one tick of
any life stage had been identified at any time in that county, or if
county records did not specify the number of ticks or life stages col-
lected. Lack of tick records from a county—“no records”—does not
imply that ticks are absent from that county, only that records of
ticks having been collected in the county are lacking.
The county status (i.e., established, reported, or no records)
given by Dennis et al. (1998) was used as the basis for our updated
county status. If a county was classified as established by Dennis
et al. (1998), it remained established in the updated classification re-
gardless of whether more recent tick records were available. A
county classified as reported by Dennis et al. (1998) retained this
status in the updated classification, unless more recent collection re-
cords changed the county’s classification from reported to estab-
lished. Herein, the term county refers to counties and county
equivalents

Data Sources
Six independent literature searches were conducted using Scopus
and PubMed databases with the following key words “Ixodes scap-
ularis,” “Ixodes pacificus,” and “tick” to identify relevant articles
and abstracts published from 1996 through 25 August 2015. We
also conducted a search to ensure that papers using the junior syno-
nym “Ixodes dammini” rather than Ixodes scapularis were included.
All reports that explicitly presented county-specific tick data were
included in our database. In addition, we visited individual state
health department Web sites to identify county-level tick surveil-
lance data, and contacted public health officials, acarologists, and
Lyme disease investigators throughout the United States to assess
county-level tick collection data.
GIS Mapping
Our final database containing state, county, county FIPS code,
county status as per Dennis et al. (1998), and the updated county
status was joined based on FIPS codes to a continental United States
county map using ArcMap 10.3 (ESRI, Redlands, CA).
Results
Counties With Recorded Presence of I. scapularis or I.
pacificus
Our updated county status records show that I. scapularis now has
been collected from 37 states, from the eastern seaboard to the east-
ern edge of the Great Plains, and I. pacificus from six western states
(Tables 1–3; Fig. 1). No single state has records of both tick species,
and five states in the Rocky Mountain region lack records for either
I. scapularis or I. pacificus: Colorado, Idaho, Montana, New
Mexico, and Wyoming. The presence of I. scapularis has now been
documented from 1,420 (45.7%) of the 3,110 continental United
States counties, as compared with 111 (3.6%) counties for I. pacif-
icus. Combined, these primary vectors of B. burgdorferi and other
tick-borne disease agents now have been identified in a total of
1,531 (49.2%) counties spread across 43 states. This marks a
44.7% increase in the number of counties that have recorded the
presence of these ticks since the survey conducted by Dennis et al.
(1998), when 1,058 counties in 41 states reported the ticks to be
present.

and

are
the
two
states
where I. scapularis was recorded only after the Dennis et al. (1998)
survey.
Counties Where I. scapularis Is Classified as Established
or Reported
Ixodes scapularis now is classified as established in 842 counties
(27.1% of counties in the continental United States) distributed
across 35 states (Tables 1–3; Fig. 1). This more than doubles the
number of counties in which the tick is classified as established since
the previous survey by Dennis et al. (1998), when it was considered
established in 396 counties (12.7% of counties in the continental
United States) spanning 32 states (Tables 1–2; Fig. 1–2). In total,
446 counties were updated from either no records (n ¼ 262) or re-
ported (n ¼ 184) to established, and 208 counties were updated
from no records to reported (Table 2; Fig. 2). Counties with I. scap-
ularis classified as established were added for three states: Kentucky,
North Dakota, and Ohio.
The data presented here suggest that I. scapularis over the past
two decades has expanded from its northeastern focus northward
into upstate New York, Vermont, New Hampshire, and northern
Maine; westward across Pennsylvania, eastern Ohio, and New
York; and south- and southwestward into West Virginia, Virginia,
and North Carolina (Fig. 2). A similar geographic expansion for I.
scapularis appears to have occurred from the long-established focus
in the North-Central states, with notable spread of counties where
the tick is now classified as established in all four cardinal directions
(Fig. 2). The two previously distinct foci in the Northeast and
North-Central states appear to be merging in the Ohio River Valley
to form a single contiguous focus. In striking contrast to the
Northeast and North-Central states, in the far South and South-
Central states, counties where I. scapularis is classified as established
have remained relatively stable since the survey by Dennis et al.
(1998) (Figs. 1–2).
Ixodes scapularis is now classified as reported in 578 counties
(18.6% of counties in the continental United States) distributed
across 30 states (Table 1; Fig. 1). Counties classified as reported for
I. scapularis generally clustered around counties classified as estab-
lished for this tick. The overall ratio of counties in which I. scapula-
ris is classified as established versus reported (established:reported)
was 1.41:1 in this study, as compared with 0.71:1 in the previous
Dennis et al. (1998) survey.

 Counties Where I. pacificus Is Classified as Established
or Reported
Ixodes pacificus is now classified as established in 95 counties, and
as reported in 16 additional counties, spanning 6 states (Tables 1, 3;
Fig. 1). The majority of these counties are in the Pacific Coast states
of California, Oregon, and Washington. Our new data mark a very
modest increase in the number of western counties in which I. pacif-
icus is classified as established since the survey by Dennis et al.
(1998), when the tick was listed as established in 90 counties; the
number of counties with reported status remained stable. In total,
five counties were updated from either no records (n ¼ 1) or re-
ported (n ¼ 4) to established and four counties were updated from
no records to reported (Table 3; Fig. 2). All county status changes
occurred in Washington, Oregon, or Utah (Tables 1, 3; Figs. 1–2).
The overall ratio of counties in which I. pacificus is classified as es-
tablished versus reported was 5.94:1 in this study, compared with
5.6:1 (Dennis et al. 1998).
Discussion
Data on the current geographic distributions of medically important
tick vectors, such as I. scapularis and I. pacificus, provide informa-
tion complementary to epidemiological data on geographic disease
case occurrence to inform the medical community and the public of
where risk for exposure to tick-borne disease agents may occur. The
lack of routine systematic surveillance across the continental United
States of ticks of public health importance hampers our ability to de-
fine their current geographic distributions and to monitor changes in
their ranges and densities over time. Although we are able to report
in this paper where I. scapularis and I. pacificus are now known to
be present at the county level, our certainty in where the tick is ab-
sent is low, especially at the edges of their ranges and in regions
where they can be assumed to occur only at low densities. Range
contractions, if they occurred, were not quantified in this study be-
cause counties that were previously considered established main-
tained that status here. Nonetheless, using survey methods similar to
those of Dennis et al. (1998), specifically, literature review and in-
clusion of unpublished data from individual researchers and state
public health departments, we showed a substantial increase over
the past nearly two decades in counties classified as having I. scapu-
laris present. Moreover, the number of counties in which I. scapula-
ris is considered established has more than doubled since the
previous national distribution map was published (Dennis et al.
1998). The majority of county status changes occurred in the North,
while the distribution in the South remained fairly stable. The
North-Central focus for I. scapularis in Minnesota and Wisconsin
appears to have expanded in all cardinal directions, and the
Northeastern focus has spread inland from the Atlantic seaboard
and expanded in both northerly and southerly directions. As a re-
sult, the two previously distinct foci in the North-Central and
Northeastern United States have now converged in the Ohio River
Valley to form a single larger focus. In striking contrast to I. scapu-
laris, increases in counties reporting the presence of I. pacificus in
the Far West were very modest.
Population genetic analyses provide support for the theory that
I. scapularis was once established across the Northeastern and
North-Central United States for thousands of years and likely colo-
nized the region following the recession of the Pleistocene ice sheet
(Humphrey et al. 2010). Thus, current trends may represent recolo-
nization of the tick’s historical range. Rapid deforestation and sup-
pression of white-tailed deer during the late 1800s and early 1990s
may have restricted I. scapularis to focal refugia (Spielman et al.
1985, Lee et al. 2013). Reforestation and increasing abundance of
white-tailed deer, the primary hosts of adult I. scapularis (Spielman
et al. 1985), are considered to have contributed to the dramatic ex-
pansion of the tick’s range over the past half century (Spielman
1994).
Our updated species distribution map shows a continued range
expansion for I. scapularis, particularly in northern states. Given the
lack of systematic surveillance for I. scapularis, one might ask if the
range expansion suggested by our data is real or merely an artifact

 of enhanced tick surveillance and research activities in some areas. A
true range expansion of I. scapularis in northern states, as described
in this report, is supported by the largely concordant changes in the
distribution of human Lyme disease cases captured through manda-
tory reporting of the disease since 1991 (Rand et al. 2007, Raizman
et al. 2012, Lee et al. 2013, Serra et al. 2013, Brinkerhoff et al.
2014, Robinson et al. 2014, Wang et al. 2014, Kugeler et al. 2015,
Mead 2015). Moreover, as detailed later in the text, true range ex-
pansions of I. scapularis have been documented in some areas where
tick surveillance was conducted routinely during the period of
emergence, or where extensive surveys were conducted at discrete
time-points spanning periods from when the tick was absent through
invasion and establishment.
The North-Central States
Within the North-Central United States, I. scapularis was first de-
scribed in a focal area of northwestern Wisconsin in the late 1960s
(Jackson and DeFoliart 1970). State-wide surveys of adult I.
scapularis collected from hunter-killed deer in Wisconsin from
1981–1989 (French et al. 1992) revealed that the tick had become
established in western, southern, and focal parts of the north, but no
evidence of the tick was found in other areas in the north or south-
eastern reaches of Wisconsin. Subsequent surveys of hunter-killed
deer documented continued expansion into the north during the
early 1990s (Riehle and Paskewitz 1996) and eventual invasion of
eastern Wisconsin by 2008–2009 (Lee et al. 2013). Ixodes scapularis
now appears to be present throughout most of the habitat that is
predicted to be suitable for the tick in the state of Wisconsin (Guerra
et al. 2002, Diuk-Wasser et al. 2010).
In neighboring Minnesota to the west, I. scapularis was classified
as reported or established primarily in counties bordering Wisconsin
in the east-central portion of Minnesota in the mid-1990s (Dennis
et al. 1998). Opportunistic sampling during 1998–1999 revealed the
presence of I. scapularis in additional northern and central
Minnesota counties (Sanders and Guilfoile 2000), and new county
records from the south-central portion of the state are presented in
this report. Paralleling this expansion of the tick’s known range in
Minnesota, Robinson et al. (2014) noted increases in both the num-
bers and geographical distributions of I. scapularis-borne diseases in
Minnesota from 1996 through 2011. The north-westerly expansion
appears to have continued into eastern North Dakota (Russart et al.
2014, Stone et al. 2015), beyond or near the limit of habitat

 previously predicted to be suitable for I. scapularis (Estrada-Pena
2002, Brownstein et al. 2003, Diuk-Wasser et al. 2010).
Wisconsin likely served as a primary source for a southerly inva-
sion of I. scapularis into Illinois, specifically along the Rock River
corridor (Cortinas and Kitron 2006). Surveys of hunter-killed deer
from Illinois conducted from 1988–1996 showed that infested deer
were restricted largely to northern counties (Cortinas et al. 2002).
However, similar surveys conducted from 1998 to 2003 showed ex-
pansion of the tick’s range to more southern counties and noted that
I. scapularis densities decreased along a northern to southern gradi-
ent, suggesting that Illinois was first colonized in the northwestern
and north-central counties, where I. scapularis indeed was first dis-
covered in the state in the late 1980s (Bouseman et al. 1990,
Cortinas and Kitron 2006). Populations of I. scapularis in the ex-
treme northeast along the Illinois River speculatively may have origi-
nated
from
established
populations
in
northwestern
Indiana
(Cortinas and Kitron 2006). In Indiana, where I. scapularis was first
collected from deer in northwestern counties in 1987 (Pinger and
Glancy 1989), densities of I. scapularis are greatest along the west-
ern border and decrease eastward; expansion to eastern counties
was observed between 2005 and 2007 (Pinger et al. 1996, Keefe
2008, Raizman et al. 2012).
Hamer et al. (2010) proposed that established I. scapularis popu-
lations in Indiana seeded colonization of lower Michigan, where the
tick was first discovered in southwestern lower Michigan in 2002
(Foster 2004). Invasion of I. scapularis northward along the coast of
Lake Michigan was documented from 2004–2008; in 2004, ticks
were collected only from the southernmost of the sampled sites,
whereas they were found in all sites by 2008. Tick densities de-
creased from south to north, supporting a view that densities would
be higher in areas where the tick has been longer established.
Notably, although inland transects were also surveyed, no evidence
of I. scapularis invasion was observed in these transects (Hamer
et al. 2010). Subsequently, I. scapularis has been reported also from
inland counties in southern Michigan (Table 2). Colonization of the
Upper Peninsula of Michigan most likely occurred via northern
Wisconsin and preceded colonization of the Lower Peninsula by
more than a decade, as I. scapularis was discovered already in the
1980s in Menominee County in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan
(Strand et al. 1992, Walker et al. 1994).
The Northeast
Similar to I. scapularis expansion in the North-Central focus, the
tick’s range in the northeastern focus appears to have expanded in
all directions, except for eastward, where the Atlantic Ocean pre-
vents further spread. Since the survey by Dennis et al. (1998), I.
scapularis appears to have expanded northward in Maine, New
Hampshire, and Vermont. In Maine, analysis of public submission
of ticks from 1989 to 2006 showed a northerly expansion along the
Atlantic coastline, followed by invasion inland along river corridors
(Rand et al. 2007). Ixodes scapularis is now considered established
in all Maine counties. In Vermont, drag sampling was conducted
from June 2011 to June 2012 along a north-south transect following
the Connecticut River: densities of I. scapularis generally decreased
from south to north, with no ticks collected from the northernmost
sites (Serra et al. 2013). Expansion of the tick’s range in these New
England states likely contributed, together with increasing tick den-
sities in already established areas, to a 5–10-fold increase in inci-
dence of reported Lyme disease cases in those states during the past
decade (Mead 2015).
Since the survey by Dennis et al. (1998), the number of New
York counties where I. scapularis is considered established has
nearly doubled from 50.0 to 98.4%. At the time of the previous re-
port, the tick was established primarily in the southeastern and east-
ern portions of the state and appears to have expanded in northerly
and westerly directions. In parallel with this observation, from 1990
to 2000, Lyme disease surveillance data revealed a northward and
westward expansion in the disease focus from a central cluster in the
southeastern portion of the state (i.e., Westchester County).
Moreover, during the same timeframe, the primary epidemiological
focus shifted northward along the Hudson River (Chen et al. 2005).
Population genetic analysis of I. scapularis collected from a transect
along the Hudson River from 2004 to 2009 indicated recent rapid
expansion of the tick’s range, primarily in a northerly direction
along the Hudson River (Khatchikian et al. 2015); expansion ap-
pears to be the result of local migration of the ticks, via movements
of mammal hosts, but some long-distance migration, perhaps via in-
festation of birds, was detected. Importantly, the DNA sequence
analyses provide evidence for recent range expansion, as opposed to
recent detection of in situ populations.
Neighboring New York to the south, Pennsylvania also experi-
enced a recent westward expansion of I. scapularis. In 2003, Lyme
disease cases were reported primarily from eastern counties in
Pennsylvania. By 2013, human Lyme disease case counts increased
markedly in western counties, with cases reported throughout the
state (Mead 2015). This mirrors data for range expansion of I. scap-
ularis in Pennsylvania. No I. scapularis were collected during a
statewide survey from 1963 to 1967 (Snetsinger 1968), whereas the
tick was recorded from 49 of 67 counties by the late 1990s (Dennis
et al. 1998). A statewide survey conducted during 2012–2014
(Hutchinson et al. 2015) revealed that the tick now is established in
all 67 counties. It is likely that the east-to-west tick expansion across
Pennsylvania continued into neighboring Ohio to the west, where
active tick surveillance was conducted from 1983 to 2012.
Surveillance data showed a dramatic increase in I. scapularis abun-
dance beginning in 2009. Arguing against increasing tick surveil-
lance as a primary source for the observed range expansion in Ohio,
the spread of the tick was observed when Ohio’s tick surveillance
programs were being considered for termination and their budgets
were dwindling (Wang et al. 2014). Currently, the I. scapularis
range in Ohio is largely consistent with the range of deciduous forest
in the state. As a result of the westward expansion of the previous
northeastern focus and the eastward expansion of the previous
North-Central focus, the distribution of I. scapularis now appears to
be continuous across northern states with convergence of the two
previously distinct foci in the Ohio River Valley.
The West Virginia, Virginia, and North Carolina Area
Ixodes scapularis has also expanded its range in West Virginia,
where only 4 counties reported the tick previously (Dennis et al.
1998) and now 43 counties are classified as either reported (n ¼ 20)
or established (n ¼ 23). Review of Lyme disease and I. scapularis
surveillance reports (see references in Table 2) suggests that the tick
is expanding westward across the state, with highly Lyme disease
endemic counties still focused in the eastern panhandle. Similarly, in
Virginia, I. scapularis was considered established primarily in east-
ern coastal counties previously (Dennis et al. 1998), but the current
survey shows the tick to now be established throughout most of
Virginia, with the highest densities of openly host-seeking ticks oc-
curring in higher elevation sites (Brinkerhoff et al. 2014, Kelly et al.
2014). The spread of openly host-seeking I. scapularis appears to

 have proceeded in a southwesterly direction in Virginia, concordant
with the expanding geographic distribution of Lyme disease cases
and increasing incidence in Virginia (Brinkerhoff et al. 2014, Lantos
et al. 2015). Comparison of the previous and current distributions
of I. scapularis in North Carolina also suggests an inland incursion
of the tick (Fig. 1). One important caveat to these findings for West
Virginia, Virginia, and North Carolina is that the observed spread
of I. scapularis may have resulted from southerly spread of I. scapu-
laris from states to the north where this tick is more prone, as com-
pared with southern populations, to seek hosts openly from
vegetation (Arsnoe et al. 2015) and therefore is more readily con-
tacted by tick dragging or flagging (Diuk-Wasser et al. 2006), or by
humans and their pets (Stromdahl and Hickling 2012). Stated
differently, this may be an invasion of more easily surveyed northern
populations of I. scapularis rather than invasion at the species level
in areas where more cryptic southern populations already may have
been present but had not been recognized. Regardless, the end result
is range expansion of I. scapularis populations that commonly con-
tact and bite humans in West Virginia, Virginia, and North
Carolina.
The Allegheny Mountains to Mississippi Valley Area
The authors (Dennis et al. 1998) of the previous survey were
intrigued with the lack of I. scapularis records, despite collection
efforts, from the Allegheny Mountains to the Mississippi Valley (an
area spanning western Pennsylvania southeastward across Kentucky
and Tennessee), because of the tick’s large geographical coverage in
the eastern United States spanning variable climates and forested
habitat types. Habitat suitability modeling suggested that the area
ranged from low (Brownstein et al. 2003, Diuk-Wasser et al. 2010)
to moderately suitable (Estrada-Pena 2002). Our revised distribu-
tion map shows the tick to now be established in this region, attest-
ing to its climate and habitat suitability for I. scapularis. Several

 studies have documented a trend in which the tick expands along ri-
parian corridors (Cortinas et al. 2002, Cortinas and Kitron 2006,
Rand et al. 2007, Hamer et al. 2010, Serra et al. 2013, Kelly et al.
2014, Khatchikian et al. 2015). This provides a hypothesis for how
the area from the Allegheny Mountains to the Mississippi Valley
could have been or is currently being invaded from areas to the
north and east with already established tick populations, first along
distinct dispersal corridors followed by more diffuse short-range
tick dispersal to suitable habitats across the landscape.
The Southeast
In contrast to the observed concordance between the reported distri-
butions of I. scapularis and human Lyme disease in the North-
Central, Northeastern, and Mid-Atlantic States, a wide distribution
of this tick vector in the Southeast is not similarly associated with
widespread Lyme disease case occurrence (Mead 2015). Lack of
concordance in the Southeast could arise for several reasons. First,
our map displays a coarse, county-scale representation of where the
tick is classified as reported or established. The advantage of the
county-scale representation is that it matches the spatial scale at
which epidemiological surveillance data are presented. However, in
some instances, the vector tick may be established only in limited
areas of a particular county, putting very few humans at risk for ex-
posure to tick bites (Eisen and Eisen 2007, Eisen and Eisen 2008).
Second, while the presence of at least one tick vector species is a pre-
requisite for sustaining enzootic transmission of B. burgdorferi, den-
sity of B. burgdorferi-infected host-seeking nymphs of a species that
commonly bite humans is a better surrogate for human risk of expo-
sure to Lyme disease spirochetes compared with tick presence data
alone. At coarse spatial scales such as states or regions of the United
States, density of infected I. scapularis nymphs is significantly and
positively associated with Lyme disease incidence (Mather et al.
1996, Stafford et al. 1998, Pepin et al. 2012).
A recent systematic field survey of I. scapularis revealed that
both the density of host-seeking I. scapularis nymphs and their rate
of infection with B. burgdorferi generally were greater in the
northern compared with southern states (Diuk-Wasser et al. 2012).
This is in agreement with field studies indicating that I. scapularis
larvae feed primarily on white-footed mice, Peromyscus leucopus
Rafinesque, and other small, highly reservoir-competent mammals
in the northeast (Spielman et al. 1985, Giardina et al. 2000),
whereas they feed frequently on lizards of, at best, low reservoir-
competence for B. burgdorferi in the southeast (Apperson et al.
1993). Moreover, the tick’s host-seeking behavior differs between
northern and southern states, such that collection of I. scapularis
nymphs by drag sampling (Diuk-Wasser et al. 2006) or from hu-
mans (Stromdahl and Hickling 2012) is rare in the south but com-
monplace in the north. Variable contact rates between humans and
nymphal ticks resulting from regional differences in host-seeking be-
havior could, in large part, explain regional differences in Lyme dis-
ease incidence between the northern and southern parts of the
eastern United States (Diuk-Wasser et al. 2012, Stromdahl and
Hickling 2012, Kelly et al. 2014, Arsnoe et al. 2015). A recent ex-
perimental field study showed differences in host-seeking behavior
between I. scapularis of northern versus southern origin, such that
ticks of northern origin were more likely to ascend vegetation while
questing for a host, regardless of whether field release arenas were
located in the north or south, suggesting that host-seeking behavior
is strongly determined by genetics and to a lesser extent by environ-
mental conditions (Arsnoe et al. 2015). Indeed, population genetic
studies show two distinct clades, with the southern clade restricted
to the south and the so-called American clade predominant in the
north (Norris et al. 1996, Qiu et al. 2002, Humphrey et al. 2010,
Van Zee et al. 2013, Sakamoto et al. 2014).
The Far-Western States
The recorded county-level distribution of I. pacificus has changed
very little since the previous survey (Dennis et al. 1998). The tick is
established primarily in coastal states along the Pacific Ocean
(Washington, Oregon, and California), but also can occur locally in
especially cool or moist settings in more arid inland states (Arizona,
Nevada, and Utah). In contrast to I. scapularis, few studies have

 sought to define the environmental variables that define the distribu-
tion of I. pacificus (Eisen et al. 2006b). Owing in part to sizeable
western counties commonly encompassing vast ecological diversity,
often with only a portion of a given county presenting risk for hu-
man exposure to I. pacificus, there is a lack of concordance between
the vector’s range as defined at the county level and the incidence of
Lyme disease. For example, in California, although the tick is estab-
lished in all but three counties, Lyme disease incidence is highest in
north-coastal counties (Eisen et al. 2006b). Although B. burgdor-
feri-infected host-seeking nymphs may be established in limited re-
gions of counties, few humans may be exposed (Eisen et al. 2006b).
In addition, densities of host-seeking I. pacificus appear to be much
lower in southern (Lane et al. 2013) compared with northern
California (Eisen et al. 2006a). Likewise, infection rates with B.
burgdorferi also appear to be lower in host-seeking nymphs from
southern compared with northern California (Eisen et al. 2010,
Lane et al. 2013).
Future Research Needs
The data presented and discussed here provide strong support for
systematic sampling to assess the density of host-seeking I. scapula-
ris, and the density of nymphs infected with B. burgdorferi and other
I. scapularis-borne human pathogens, in strategic areas where the
tick can be expected to invade or increase dramatically in numbers
in the near future. We also recognize needs for: 1) improved regional
habitat suitability models to better define the likely extent for con-
tinued expansion of I. scapularis; 2) population genetic studies
aimed at identifying changes in the geographic range of the
American clade of I. scapularis, especially in areas previously domi-
nated by the southern clade such as Virginia, and North Carolina
where American clade invasion likely results in increased human
tick bites; and 3) longitudinal studies aimed at identifying how the
convergence of the North-Central and Northeastern tick foci may
result in changes in B. burgdorferi genotypes (Pepin et al. 2012),
particularly those most likely to cause disease in humans, in the con-
vergence area itself as well as across the North-Central and
Northeast states.
