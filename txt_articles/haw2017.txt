IMPORTANCE Diabetes prevention is imperative to slow worldwide growth of diabetes-related
morbidity and mortality. Yet the long-term efficacy of prevention strategies remains unknown.
OBJECTIVE To estimate aggregate long-term effects of different diabetes prevention
strategies on diabetes incidence.
DATA SOURCES Systematic searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Web of
Science databases. The initial search was conducted on January 14, 2014, and was updated on
February 20, 2015. Search terms included prediabetes, primary prevention, and risk reduction.
STUDY SELECTION Eligible randomized clinical trials evaluated lifestyle modification (LSM)
and medication interventions (>6 months) for diabetes prevention in adults (age �18 years)
at risk for diabetes, reporting between-group differences in diabetes incidence, published
between January 1, 1990, and January 1, 2015. Studies testing alternative therapies and
bariatric surgery, as well as those involving participants with gestational diabetes, type 1 or 2
diabetes, and metabolic syndrome, were excluded.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Reviewers extracted the number of diabetes cases at the
end of active intervention in treatment and control groups. Random-effects meta-analyses
were used to obtain pooled relative risks (RRs), and reported incidence rates were used to
compute pooled risk differences (RDs).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The main outcome was aggregate RRs of diabetes in
treatment vs control participants. Treatment subtypes (ie, LSM components, medication
classes) were stratified. To estimate sustainability, post-washout and follow-up RRs for
medications and LSM interventions, respectively, were examined.
RESULTS Forty-three studies were included and pooled in meta-analysis (49 029
participants; mean [SD] age, 57.3 [8.7] years; 48.0% [n = 23 549] men): 19 tested
medications; 19 evaluated LSM, and 5 tested combined medications and LSM. At the end of
the active intervention (range, 0.5-6.3 years), LSM was associated with an RR reduction of
39% (RR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.54-0.68), and medications were associated with an RR reduction
of 36% (RR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.54-0.76). The observed RD for LSM and medication studies was
4.0 (95% CI, 1.8-6.3) cases per 100 person-years or a number-needed-to-treat of 25. At the
end of the washout or follow-up periods, LSM studies (mean follow-up, 7.2 years; range,
5.7-9.4 years) achieved an RR reduction of 28% (RR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.60-0.86); medication
studies (mean follow-up, 17 weeks; range, 2-52 weeks) showed no sustained RR reduction
(RR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.79-1.14).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In adults at risk for diabetes, LSM and medications (weight
loss and insulin-sensitizing agents) successfully reduced diabetes incidence. Medication
effects were short lived. The LSM interventions were sustained for several years; however,
their effects declined with time, suggesting that interventions to preserve effects are needed.

iabetes is a burdensome, costly disease affecting 415
million adults globally, with projections of 642 mil-
lion adults affected by 2040.1 Diabetes is the leading
cause of end-stage renal failure, adult-onset blindness, and
nontraumaticamputationsandsignificantlycontributestocar-
diovascular morbidity and mortality.2 Treatment costs of type
2 diabetes (subsequently referred to as diabetes) remain a sig-
nificant burden on individuals and health care systems,
amounting to $245 billion in the United States alone in 2012.3
Primary prevention of diabetes has proved to be cost-
effective in various populations and settings3 and is there-
fore crucial to reducing growing diabetes burdens. Yet, trans-
lating these findings into practice remains a major challenge.
Although many studies have tested different diabetes pre-
vention interventions, data remain discordant on which mo-
dalities offer long-term efficacy. Previous reviews and meta-
analyses have reported that both lifestyle modification (LSM)
(ie, physical activity and dietary changes) and medications are
beneficial in preventing progression to diabetes, but there are
conflicting results regarding which type, frequency, and in-
tensity of LSM or medications are most enduring that would
inform clinical practice.4-8 Lack of evidence on the long-term
efficacy of diabetes prevention interventions may compro-
mise policy-making guidance. The need for such guidance is
especially important as several countries embark on national
diabetes prevention programs.9,10
To deliver more granular direction in such efforts, this sys-
tematic review and meta-analysis provides an updated, rig-
orous evaluation of a large number of studies with compre-
hensive analysis of long-term efficacy of various nonsurgical
diabetes prevention strategies using data from randomized
clinical trials.
Methods
Data Sources and Searches
We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Web
of Science databases for eligible articles published and in-
dexed from January 1, 1990, to January 1, 2015. We used com-
binations of Medical Subject Headings and search terms, such
as prediabetes, primary prevention, and risk reduction (full
search strategy available in eTable 1 in the Supplement). There
was no restriction on language of publication, and non-
Englisharticlesweretranslated.Weundertooktheinitialsearch
on January 14, 2014, and performed an updated search on Feb-
ruary 20, 2015. All publications were screened for eligibility
independently by 2 of us (J.S.H., M.J.M.), with disagreements
resolved by another one of us (M.K.A.). We adhered to PRISMA
reporting guidelines for this systematic review and
meta-analysis.11Nopatientsweredirectlyinvolvedinthismeta-
analysis.
Study Selection
We included published randomized clinical trials testing the
efficacy of diabetes prevention interventions lasting at least
6 months in adults (age ≥18 years) with prediabetes, defined
by either impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), impaired fasting
glucose (IFG), or both, using diagnostic criteria according to
the American Diabetes Association (1997 and 2003)12,13 or
World Health Organization (1985, 1999, or 2006)14,15 and re-
porting between-treatment group differences in diabetes in-
cidencerates.DiabeteswasdefinedaccordingtoAmericanDia-
betes Association or World Health Organization criteria, which
differed slightly depending on the year the study was per-
formed, but all trials used either oral glucose tolerance tests
and/or fasting plasma glucose levels to diagnose diabetes. We
excluded studies involving individuals with type 1 or 2 diabe-
tes, gestational diabetes, metabolic syndrome (where predia-
betesstatuswasnotconfirmed),andageyoungerthan18years.
We also excluded studies evaluating alternative therapies due
to the large heterogeneity and lack of data on active ingredi-
ents or their potential physiologic effects. We excluded bar-
iatric surgeries given the distinctive nature of these interven-
tions, rigid inclusion criteria, and cost.
Data Extraction
From the identified studies, we extracted or calculated the
number of persons who developed diabetes at the end of the
active intervention period and, when reported, at the end of
the washout or follow-up periods (ie, time when participants
were observed after discontinuing interventions). Partici-
pant characteristics (eg, age, sex, and body mass index) and
studycharacteristics(eg,samplesize,treatmentduration)were
also extracted. Data were obtained using standardized abstrac-
tion templates. When the results of a study were reported in
multiple publications, data from all publications were ex-
tractedunderasinglestudyidentityandusedfordifferentsub-
group analyses. In studies including mixed cohorts of people
with prediabetes and diabetes or metabolic syndrome, we ex-
tracted data only for the prediabetes cohort. Thirty authors
were contacted 1 to 5 times to clarify or obtain unpublished
data required for our meta-analysis. Efforts were made to con-
tact authors who had changed affiliation and contact infor-
mation since publication. Of these, 6 authors provided addi-
tional data; in cases in which authors did not respond, we used
data reported to calculate the needed values or did not in-
clude the study in the analyses.
Key Points
Questions How much do primary prevention strategies reduce
the risk of conversion from prediabetes to diabetes, and are initial
effects sustained over the long term?
Findings In this meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials
including 49 029 participants, lifestyle modification and
medications promoting weight loss or insulin sensitization were
associated with reduced diabetes risk by 36% to 39%. Effects of
medications were not sustained after they were discontinued;
effects of lifestyle modification, however, were sustained after
intervention was stopped, although the effects waned over time.
Meaning For individuals at risk for diabetes, healthy lifestyle
changes, weight loss, or use of insulin-sensitizing medications
slow the progression to diabetes similarly; lifestyle modification
strategies are better in the long term, although strategies to
maintain their effects are needed.

 Quality Assessment
To assess the quality of studies, we used a set of quality indi-
cators adapted from those proposed by Jadad et al.16 The first
indicator was blinding: whether the study blinded partici-
pants or health care professionals (1 point), both (2 points), or
neither (0 points). The second indicator was attrition: whether
an attrition rate of less than 20% (2 points), over 20% (1 point),
or differential attrition between groups (0 points) was re-
ported. The third indicator was statistical methods used to
minimize the impact of attrition if intent-to-treat analysis
(2 points) or per protocol (1 point) were applied, or if none were
reported (0 points). Since all of our studies were randomized
clinical trials, we replaced the random allocation indicator by
afourthindicatorassessingwhetherCONSORTguidelineswere
used for appropriate randomized clinical trial reporting
(2 points),17 no guidelines were used but reporting was clear
(1 point), or reporting was unclear (0 points). Scores were
summed to obtain composite quality scores for each study.
Studies scoring 0 to 3 points were classified as low quality,
4 to 6 as medium quality, and 7 to 8 as high quality.
Statistical Analysis
We used random effects meta-analysis models to account for
heterogeneity between studies.18 For trials reporting zero
events in 1 of the study arms, we used a continuity correction
of 0.5. We estimated the aggregate relative risk (RR) for dia-
betes achieved at the end of active intervention in LSM and
medication trials separately. We estimated aggregate RRs for
different subtypes of LSM strategies (ie, diet, physical activ-
ity, or combined) and medication subclasses (eg, insulin sen-
sitizers, insulin secretagogues). To explore intervention ef-
fects after treatment withdrawal, we estimated the aggregate
RR for diabetes at the end of active intervention and at the end
of the washout period for medication trials or at the end of the
follow-up period for LSM trials.
We estimated heterogeneity across studies by computing
I2, where I2 greater than 75% indicated significant heteroge-
neity. We used meta-regressions to explore the contribution
of participant demographic characteristics and weight change
to intervention effect heterogeneity.18 We assessed publica-
tion bias using the Egger test and visual exploration of funnel
plots. The number of studies with null effects that were miss-
ing from the meta-analysis was estimated using the trim-and-
fill method.19 Sensitivity analyses were conducted according
to study quality category (low, medium, and high) to explore
the risk of bias on the meta-analytic estimates. The metafor
package20 in R, version 3.2.1 programming language was used
to fit the models described.

Of the 20 489 titles identified, 4473 abstracts were reviewed
and78publishedarticleswereselectedforfullreview.Ofthese,
51 articles were included, and 2 additional articles were iden-
tified manually.21,22 Overall, 53 articles were included in the
systematic review (Figure 1). Of the included articles, 10 were

ing was deemed appropriate among these studies.
Of the studies analyzed, 19 evaluated single or multiple
medications, 19 tested LSMs, and 5 tested both medication and
LSMs. Forty studies had a total follow-up length ranging from
0.5 to 6.3 years, while the US Diabetes Prevention Program
(DPP),33,34 the Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study (DPS),35,36
and the Da Qing Diabetes Prevention Study (Da Qing)37,38 re-
ported follow-up lengths of 10, 13, and 20 years since random-
ization, respectively. The total number of participants across
studies was 49 029 (mean [SD] age, 57.3 [8.7] years; 23 549
[48.0%] men; baseline body mass index, 30.8 [calculated as
weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared]) and
included Asian, North American, and European participants
(eTable 2 in the Supplement).
Efficacy of LSM Interventions
During the active intervention period (mean [SD], 2.6 [1.7]
years; range, 0.5-6.0 years), LSM studies (n = 19) achieved an
RR reduction of 39% (RR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.54-0.68). Diabetes
incidence rates in intervention participants were 7.4 cases per
100 person-years compared with 11.4 cases per 100 person-
years in control participants (risk difference [RD], 4.0; 95% CI,

0.51-0.69).
Efficacy of Medication Interventions
During the active intervention period (mean [SD], 3.1 [1.5]
years; range, 1.0-6.3 years), medication trials (n = 21; 18
medication and 3 LSM plus medication trials) achieved an
RR reduction of 36% (RR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.54-0.76). Diabetes
incidence rates in intervention participants were 5.4 cases
per 100 person-years compared with 9.4 cases per 100
person-years in control participants (RD, 4.0; 95% CI, 2.3-
5.7). Overall, 25 persons would need to be treated to prevent
1 case of diabetes. Weight loss drugs (orlistat, combination
phentermine-topiramate) achieved the largest RR reduction
of 63% (RR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.22-0.62) (Figure 3).33,44,55-73
Insulin sensitizers (metformin, rosiglitazone, and pioglita-
zone) achieved an RR reduction of 53% (RR, 0.47; 95% CI,
0.32-0.68). Among renin-angiotensin system blockade
drugs, only valsartan achieved a significant 10% RR reduc-
tion (RR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.85-0.95). α-Glucosidase inhibitors
(acarbose, voglibose) achieved a 38% RR reduction (RR,
0.62; 95% CI, 0.44-0.88), with 2 studies showing significant
effects and 3 studies showing no effects. A lipid-lowering

Sustainability of Diabetes Prevention
To explore whether diabetes prevention effects were sus-
tainedaftertreatmentwithdrawal,weestimatedtheRRfordia-
betes at the end of the intervention and at the end of the wash-
out or follow-up periods among studies reporting these data
(5 testing medications, 3 testing LSM, and 1 testing LSM and
medication) (Table). Of medication trials, 2 tested insulin sen-
sitizers (metformin, rosiglitazone),21,22,33,72 1 evaluated an in-
sulin secretagogue (glipizide),65 and the remaining 3 tested a
renin-angiotensin system blockade,22,57 α-glucosidase
inhibitor,69 and insulin.67 The mean observation periods for
washouts across these studies was 17 weeks (range, 2-52
weeks). Compared with those receiving placebo, participants
receiving the study drug had a 29% lower diabetes risk at the
end of the active intervention (RR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.55-0.92),
while no significant RR reductions were observed at the end
of the washout period (RR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.79-1.14). Of LSM
trials, 4 (DPP,33,34 Da Qing,37,38 DPS,35,36 and Swinburn et al40)
providedfollow-updata.OnlytheDPPtrialimplementedstrat-
egies to maintain lifestyle changes and offered the LSM inter-
vention to control participants during the postintervention ob-
servation period. The mean follow-up duration across these
studieswas7.2years(range,5.7-9.4years).Comparedwithcon-
trol participants, those receiving LSM intervention had a 45%
lower diabetes risk at the end of the active intervention pe-
riod (RR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.43-0.70) and a 28% lower risk at the
end of the follow-up period (RR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.60-0.86).
Heterogeneity and Study Quality
Studies were heterogeneous, leading to a high proportion of
variability between study effects. Heterogeneity was larger for
medication (I2 range, 0%-89%) than LSM (I2 range, 0%-36%)
studies. In a multivariate meta-regression, amount of weight
lost, participant mean age, and proportion of male partici-
pants accounted for 59% of the heterogeneity (P < .01). In this
model, only weight lost was significantly associated with dia-
betes risk, in which every kilogram lost explained an addi-
tional 7% decrease in diabetes relative risk (β = −0.07; P < .01)
(eFigure 1 in the Supplement).
Of the 43 pooled studies, 38 were unique trials and 5 were
reports of different follow-up periods of studies already in-
cluded. Of the 38 unique studies, 11 were classified as high-
quality, 22 as medium-quality, and 5 as low-quality. In sensi-
tivity analyses, high-, medium-, and low-quality studies
showed similar RR reductions ranging from 35% in high-
quality (RR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.50-0.84), 37% in medium-
quality (RR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.54-0.73), and 42% in low-quality
(RR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.41-0.81) studies.
We found evidence of publication bias (t = −4.139;
P < .001), and visual examination of the funnel plot showed
that studies with small or null effects were less likely to be
published (eFigure 2 in the Supplement). The trim-and-fill
test demonstrated that approximately 9 studies with null
effects were missing, and sensitivity analysis showed that, if
included, diabetes RR reduction would be smaller (33% vs
36%), albeit still significant (P < .001). When examined indi-
vidually, no study was found to significantly influence
aggregate estimates.

 Discussion
This meta-analysis shows that LSM and certain medications
are effective in preventing diabetes in persons at risk, al-
though only LSM strategies seem to have a sustainable effect.
Diet with physical activity or weight loss and insulin-
sensitizing medications prevent progression to diabetes in in-
dividuals at risk, with 25 persons needing to be treated to pre-
ventasinglediabetescase.Acrossallinterventions,weightloss
appears to be the key factor associated with reduced diabetes
progression.
Our findings show that LSM interventions are efficacious
for preventing diabetes. The RR reduction that we observed
in LSM interventions is similar to estimates from other
meta-analyses.4,8 Combined diet alterations and physical ac-
tivity proved to be more effective in reducing progression to
diabetes than either strategy alone. Since caloric intake and
physical activity are independently associated with reduced
diabetes risk, combining these may exert an additive effect.
Medications are efficacious in preventing diabetes in those
atriskintheshortterm,althoughtheypresentwithwidevaria-
tions depending on the class of medication; these results are
similar to those from previous meta-analyses.4,6,8 Our study
expands this evidence by including combined phentermine-
topiramate, a newer antiobesity drug.56 We showed that
weight-loss medications, followed by insulin sensitizers,
achieved the greatest diabetes risk reductions. Newer US Food
and Drug Administration–approved weight loss medications
(eg,liraglutide,combinednaltrexone-bupropion)mayalsoslow
progression to diabetes, although studies testing these drugs
were pending at the time of our literature search. Insulin sen-
sitizers, such as the glitazones and metformin, have shown ef-
ficacy for diabetes prevention in other meta-analyses.4,5,8 We
found mixed or small effects of α-glucosidase inhibitors and
renin-angiotensin system blockers, indicating insufficient evi-
dence to make firm conclusions.
To our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis to ex-
plore the long-term effects of diabetes prevention interven-
tions after treatment withdrawal. We found that participants
receiving LSM interventions had lower risk for diabetes than
control participants 5 to 9 years after completing the interven-
tion, although the effects decreased over time. However, our
aggregate findings regarding the durability of LSM may also
be considered conservative since the control arm of DPP re-
ceived the intervention when the trial was prematurely
stopped; therefore, all long-term, between-group differences
are smaller than if the control participants had not received
any intervention. The 15-year follow-up results of the DPP
found a similar waning of effects after the initial 2.8 years of
active intervention,74 suggesting plateauing of effects or satu-
ration among at-risk individuals as most have already pro-
gressed to diabetes. This diminished effect also suggests that
maintenance strategies, such as those tested in the DPP, may
be needed to sustain intervention effects. Regarding the sus-
tainability of medication effects, our analysis using washout
data showed that the initial effects of medications dissipated
after the washout period. This finding suggests that medica-
tions do not permanently alter fundamental pathophysiol-
ogy of insulin resistance or β-cell dysfunction and likely only
suppress hyperglycemia for the time that they are adminis-
tered. No weight loss medications were included in this sub-
groupanalysis,indicatinganeedforfurtherstudiesonthelong-
termeffectsofweightlossmedicationsonbothweightlostand
regained and their effects on future diabetes incidence. Over-
all, our findings suggest that LSM interventions are promis-
ing long-term diabetes prevention strategies; however, main-
tenance interventions, even if intermittent, may be needed
for prolonged intervention effects.
We found that every kilogram of weight lost was associ-
ated with an additional 7% decrease in risk of progression to
diabetes. Other systematic reviews and meta-analyses have
shown variable effects of weight loss on the incidence of dia-
betes, reporting positive and null effects.4,7,8 Physiologically,
it has been shown that losing weight depletes free fatty acids
from both muscle and liver, resulting in improved insulin sen-
sitivity and glucose homeostasis.75 Additional research has
demonstrated that obesity-induced β-cell dysfunction can be
restoredwithcaloricrestrictionandreversiontonormalweight
in overweight and obese individuals.76 The long-term effect
in insulin resistance and β-cell dysfunction associated with
weight lost due to lifestyle changes vs medications vs bariat-
ric surgery requires further investigation.
Overall, the evidence that this meta-analysis provides is
strong given that all of the studies used randomized clinical
trial study designs and 79% of the included studies were
deemed as having low risk of bias (ie, they were medium to
high quality). However, we found evidence of publication bias,
which means that smaller studies with null effects were less
likely to be published. Countries that plan to launch national
diabetes prevention programs should consider modeling their
strategies after LSM interventions proven to prevent diabe-
tes, such as the DPP, DPS, and Da Qing, and to implement strat-
egies to sustain long-term effects. Gaps that remain include ex-
ploring intervention effects according to glucose intolerance
type (ie, IFG vs IGT), publishing studies with null effects, and
economicevaluationsoflong-termmaintenancestrategies.Fu-
ture studies and meta-analyses should consider addressing
these gaps.
Limitations
Although we provide a comprehensive, rigorous meta-
analysis on the efficacy of diabetes prevention treatments, this
study has some limitations. We found a high level of hetero-
geneity in treatment effects, which was only partially ex-
plained in meta-regressions and subgroup analyses. This
heterogeneity suggests that there are other factors affecting
treatment efficacy that were not accounted for, which may in-
volve the pooling of both IFG and IGT definitions of predia-
betes. Comparisons among studies require caution given that
variousdefinitionsofdiabeteswereusedinthetrials(eg,World
Health Organization 1985, 1999, and 2006; American Diabe-
tes Association 1997, 2003), although they were used consis-
tently within each trial. Another limitation is that we did
not directly compare the efficacy of LSM against that of medi-
cations; a network meta-analysis is required for such com-

better long-term effects than medications, although strate-
gies to sustain intervention effects are needed. As interven-

term sustainability on a large-scale is critical in addressing the
global diabetes burden.
