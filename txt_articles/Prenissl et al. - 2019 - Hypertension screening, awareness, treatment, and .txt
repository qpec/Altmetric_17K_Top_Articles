Abstract
Background
Evidence on where in the hypertension care process individuals are lost to care, and how
this varies among states and population groups in a country as large as India, is essential
for the design of targeted interventions and to monitor progress. Yet, to our knowledge,
there has not yet been a nationally representative analysis of the proportion of adults who
reach each step of the hypertension care process in India. This study aimed to determine (i)
the proportion of adults with hypertension who have been screened, are aware of their diag-
nosis, take antihypertensive treatment, and have achieved control and (ii) the variation of
these care indicators among states and sociodemographic groups.
Methods and findings
We used data from a nationally representative household survey carried out from 20 Janu-
ary 2015 to 4 December 2016 among individuals aged 15–49 years in all states and union
territories (hereafter “states”) of the country. The stages of the care process—computed
among those with hypertension at the time of the survey—were (i) having ever had one’s
blood pressure (BP) measured before the survey (“screened”), (ii) having been diagnosed
(“aware”), (iii) currently taking BP-lowering medication (“treated”), and (iv) reporting being

 treated and not having a raised BP (“controlled”). We disaggregated these stages by state,
rural–urban residence, sex, age group, body mass index, tobacco consumption, household
wealth quintile, education, and marital status. In total, 731,864 participants were included in
the analysis. Hypertension prevalence was 18.1% (95% CI 17.8%–18.4%). Among those
with hypertension, 76.1% (95% CI 75.3%–76.8%) had ever received a BP measurement,
44.7% (95% CI 43.6%–45.8%) were aware of their diagnosis, 13.3% (95% CI 12.9%–
13.8%) were treated, and 7.9% (95% CI 7.6%–8.3%) had achieved control. Male sex, rural
location, lower household wealth, and not being married were associated with greater losses
at each step of the care process. Between states, control among individuals with hyperten-
sion varied from 2.4% (95% CI 1.7%–3.3%) in Nagaland to 21.0% (95% CI 9.8%–39.6%) in
Daman and Diu. At 38.0% (95% CI 36.3%–39.0%), 28.8% (95% CI 28.5%–29.2%), 28.4%
(95% CI 27.7%–29.0%), and 28.4% (95% CI 27.8%–29.0%), respectively, Puducherry,
Tamil Nadu, Sikkim, and Haryana had the highest proportion of all adults (irrespective of
hypertension status) in the sampled age range who had hypertension but did not achieve
control. The main limitation of this study is that its results cannot be generalized to adults
aged 50 years and older—the population group in which hypertension is most common.
Conclusions
Hypertension prevalence in India is high, but the proportion of adults with hypertension who
are aware of their diagnosis, are treated, and achieve control is low. Even after adjusting for
states’ economic development, there is large variation among states in health system per-
formance in the management of hypertension. Improvements in access to hypertension
diagnosis and treatment are especially important among men, in rural areas, and in popula-
tions with lower household wealth.
Author summary
Why was this study done?
• Hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease, which is the leading cause
of death in India.
• The cascade of care for some chronic diseases—i.e., the proportion with a relevant con-
dition who have ever been screened, are aware of their diagnosis, are on medication,
and have achieved control—is a useful concept to inform intervention design and assess
health system performance.
• To date, there has been little large-scale population-based evidence from India on the
steps from screening for to successful control of hypertension at which people are lost
from care.

 What did the researchers do and find?
• Using data from a nationally representative survey of 731,864 individuals aged 15 to 49
years sampled from all states and union territories in India, we constructed the hyper-
tension care cascade by computing the percentage of participants with hypertension
who reported ever having their blood pressure measured before the survey (“screened”),
had previously been diagnosed with hypertension (“aware”), reported currently taking
blood-pressure-lowering medication (“treated”), and were treated and had a normal
blood pressure (“controlled”).
• Among those with hypertension, 76.1% had been screened, 44.7% were aware of their
diagnosis, 13.3% were treated, and 7.9% had achieved control.
• In addition to a large degree of variation in the hypertension care cascade between states
in India, we found that being male, living in a rural location, living in a less wealthy
household, and not being married were associated with greater losses at each step of the
care cascade.
What do these findings mean?
• Whereas some states perform substantially better than others and thus may hold impor-
tant policy lessons, across India most individuals aged 15 to 49 years with hypertension
do not successfully transition through the steps of the care cascade.
• Interventions to improve hypertension care may want to target men, individuals in
rural areas, and those with low household wealth, because these population groups were
particularly likely to be lost at each step of the hypertension care cascade.
• An important limitation of this study is that the results cannot be generalized to adults
aged 50 years and older, which is the population segment with the highest hypertension
prevalence.
Introduction
India is experiencing a rapid increase in noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) while still grap-
pling with a high burden of infectious diseases and maternal and child health conditions [1].
Cardiovascular disease (CVD), which is the leading cause of disease burden as measured by
disability-adjusted life years in the country, caused an estimated 25% of India’s NCD burden
in 2016. Hypertension is a major risk factor for CVD, particularly ischemic heart disease and
stroke [2,3]. While the prevalence of hypertension declined in many high-income countries
from 1975 to 2015, it rose substantially in most low-income and middle-income countries,
and especially in South Asia [4]. In a recent nationally representative study among 1.3 million
adults in India, we found that 25% of adults had raised blood pressure (BP), with even young
adults aged 18–25 years having a substantial prevalence, at 12% [5].
Antihypertensive medications are both inexpensive and efficacious [6,7]. Yet, only a minor-
ity of adults with hypertension in India are diagnosed and receive recommended treatment
[8]. This lack of care for people with hypertension, combined with the rapid rise of CVD in

 India [9], requires concerted attention if the Sustainable Development Goal 3 target of reduc-
ing premature mortality from NCDs by 30% by 2030 is to be achieved [10]. An important first
step in improving care for people with hypertension is to obtain a detailed understanding of
current health system performance in managing hypertension—both as a benchmark to assess
progress over time and to inform the design of appropriate health system interventions. Yet, to
date, to our knowledge, studies examining management of hypertension in India have been
carried out only in selected states or cities [8,11–13].
This is to our knowledge the first large-scale population-based study that examines health
system performance in management of hypertension in India, and in each of its 29 states and 7
union territories. We use a “cascade of care” approach, which depicts where along the care
process patients are lost to care, and which can powerfully illustrate what types of interventions
(e.g., detection and diagnosis, promotion of medication adherence, or retention-in-care activi-
ties) are needed. Using data from a nationally representative sample of adults aged 15–49 years
in India, this study, therefore, aims to (i) determine the cascade of care for hypertension in
India and (ii) examine how it varies among states and union territories and population groups.
Methods
Data source
We used data from the 2015–2016 National Family Health Survey (NFHS-4), which is a house-
hold survey that covered each district in all 29 states and 7 union territories of India. The
NFHS-4 was conducted under the stewardship of India’s Ministry of Health and Family Wel-
fare and was managed by the International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS), Mumbai
[14]. ICF International provided technical assistance. The survey was supported financially by
the US Agency for International Development and India’s Ministry of Health and Family Wel-
fare. Data collection began on 20 January 2015 and ended on 4 December 2016. The NFHS-4
is representative both at the national level and at the level of the states and union territories.
The NFHS-4 sample was self-weighting at the level of the district. This was achieved in a
2-stage cluster random sampling approach by sampling the primary sampling units (villages in
rural areas and census enumeration blocks in urban areas) with probability proportional to
population size (using population estimates from the 2011 India census), and then sampling
the same absolute number of households in each primary sampling unit [15]. Households
were selected through systematic random sampling (i.e., sampling every nth household) after a
complete mapping and household listing. The data collection team revisited households up to
3 times if no one was present in the household or an eligible household member was not avail-
able at the time of the household visit.
The NFHS-4 sampled more women than men because the survey had a focus on maternal
and child health. Specifically, all non-pregnant women aged 15–49 years and—in a random
sub-sample of 15% of households—men aged 15–54 years were eligible for the survey ques-
tionnaire and BP measurements. Men aged 50–54 years were excluded from this analysis to
ensure an equal age range among women and men. The response rate (for both the question-
naire and the BP measurements) was 96.7% among women and 91.9% among men. More
detail on the methodology of the NFHS-4 can be found in Methods A in S1 Supplemental
Materials and in the official report of the NFHS-4 [16].
Data collection
Prior to the main data collection phase of the survey, a pilot of the NFHS-4 was conducted,
which consisted of 147 household interviews, 183 women’s interviews, 121 men’s interviews,
and biomarker measurements (including BP) among 181 adults. In addition, three 1- to

 2-week “training of trainers” courses were carried out by IIPS and ICF International in Puri
(Odisha), Mumbai (Maharashtra), and Chandigarh (Chandigarh). The coordinators who par-
ticipated as trainees in these courses were then responsible for the training of all fieldworkers
in each of India’s states and union territories. In addition, all fieldworkers underwent a special
physical measurement and biomarker training, which included taking accurate BP measure-
ments. Specifically, the training consisted of role playing with other fieldworkers, practice at
healthcare facilities under the supervision of healthcare workers, and initial supervision of
measurements by more experienced fieldworkers during the main data collection phase. A
detailed description of the biomarker measurement training and procedures can be found in
the NFHS-4 biomarker questionnaire [17] and the biomarker manual distributed to each
trainee [18].
The NFHS-4 team implemented several measures aimed at ensuring high data quality,
which included (i) multiple levels of monitoring and supervision, including supervision by
field agency district coordinators, IIPS project officers, staff and consultants from ICF Interna-
tional, and representatives from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare; (ii) revisits by
field supervisors of a random subset of participants to verify their questionnaire answers; and
(iii) the use of computer-assisted personal interviewing, which allowed the supervising institu-
tions to continuously monitor data collection progress and quality. Collected data were sent
daily via an internet file streaming system to IIPS. Further details regarding the data collection
process can be found in the official report of the NFHS-4 [16], the supervisor manual [19], the
biomarker manual [18], and the interviewer manual [20].
Ascertaining hypertension
Systolic and diastolic BP were measured 3 times (using a portable Omron BP monitor, model
HEM-8712) in each individual on the same arm, with at least 5 minutes between each BP mea-
surement and 5 minutes of sitting before the first measurement. We used the mean of the 3 BP
measurements to calculate BP. If 1 measurement was missing for an individual in the dataset
(2.3% of those with �1 measurement), we used the mean of the remaining 2 measurements. If
2 measurements were missing (1.5% of those with �1 measurement), we used the remaining
measurement. Reasons for missing values were not given. Raised BP was defined as having a
mean systolic BP � 140 mm Hg or a mean diastolic BP � 90 mm Hg [21]. We did not use the
new American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Clinical
Practice Guidelines threshold for stage 1 hypertension (systolic BP � 130 mm Hg or diastolic
BP � 80 mm Hg) because this guideline was not used in clinical practice in India at the time of
data collection for the NFHS-4 [22].
Hypertension was defined as having raised BP or responding with “yes” to at least 1 of the 2
following questions: (i) “Were you told on 2 or more different occasions by a doctor or other
health professional that you had hypertension or high blood pressure?” (in line with most clin-
ical guidelines that recommend confirming a high BP at a later time through a second BP mea-
surement [22]) and (ii) “To lower your blood pressure, are you now taking a prescribed
medicine?” [17]. These questions were asked of all participants regardless of their BP. Our
hypertension definition differs from the one used in the official NFHS-4 report in that the
NFHS-4 report did not include self-reported previous diagnosis of hypertension in its defini-
tion [16].
Constructing the hypertension care cascade
The hypertension cascade was constructed only among those with hypertension (as per the
definition above), whereby the denominator was the same for each step [23]. Specifically,

 participants with hypertension were considered to have been “screened” if they responded
with “yes” to the question, “Before this survey, has your blood pressure ever been checked?”
Participants were considered as being “aware” if they responded with “yes” to the question,
“Were you told on two or more different occasions by a doctor or other health professional
that you had hypertension or high blood pressure?” Participants were considered as being
“treated” if they responded with “yes” to the question, “To lower your blood pressure, are you
now taking a prescribed medicine?” We assumed that all those who were “treated” were also
“aware.” Lastly, “controlled” hypertension was defined as being “treated” and having mean sys-
tolic BP < 140 mm Hg and diastolic BP < 90 mm Hg per the survey BP measurement. Those
who were “aware” but, paradoxically, responded with “no” to the question “Before this survey,
has your blood pressure ever been checked?” were excluded from the analysis. This was the
case for 2.1% of those with hypertension. The unmet needs for the care outcomes
“unscreened,” “unaware,” “untreated,” and “uncontrolled” were defined as the reciprocal val-
ues of “screened,” “aware,” “treated,” and “controlled,” respectively. The calculation of the per-
centage and total number of adults aged 15 to 49 years in each state/union territory who had
unmet needs for each care indicator is described in Methods B in S1 Supplemental Materials.
Predictors of reaching each care cascade step
We examined how the probability of reaching each step of the care cascade varied by the fol-
lowing variables: age, sex, body mass index (BMI), tobacco consumption (smoking tobacco,
consuming smokeless tobacco), rural versus urban location, education, household wealth
quintile, marital status (currently married or not), and state or union territory. Because the
World Health Organization (WHO) considers the BMI cutoffs of �23.0 kg/m2 and �27.5 kg/
m2 to be of public health significance in South Asian populations, in addition to the thresholds
of �25.0 kg/m2 and �30.0 kg/m2 for overweight and obesity, we grouped BMI into the follow-
ing categories: <18.5 kg/m2, 18.5–22.9 kg/m2, 23.0–24.9 kg/m2, 25.0–27.4 kg/m2, 27.5–29.9
kg/m2, and �30.0 kg/m2 [24–26]. Education was categorized as “primary school unfinished,”
“primary school finished,” “secondary school unfinished,” and “secondary school finished or
above.” Household wealth quintile was computed based on a household wealth index, which
was created—using the methodology by Filmer and Pritchett [27]—separately for rural and
urban areas. The household wealth index used data on 7 key household characteristics and
household ownership of 25 durable goods. The creation of the household wealth index is
described in more detail in Methods C in S1 Supplemental Materials.
Statistical analysis
Sampling weights were computed to account for the survey design. We assigned a higher
weight to male than female participants to adjust for the lower probability of sampling men
(whereby we used the sex distribution of the Indian population by 1-year age group per the
2011 Indian census). The probability of reaching each cascade step was computed using sam-
pling weights and disaggregated by the following variables: age group, sex, rural versus urban
location, household wealth quintile, and state or union territory (hereafter “state”). Because
financing hypertension care may be more feasible in richer than in poorer states, we plotted
the state-level probability of reaching each cascade step against the state’s gross domestic prod-
uct (GDP) per capita (in 2015 international dollars) to identify states that were performing
well or poorly relative to their level of wealth.
To determine individual-level predictors of reaching each cascade step, we used a separate
Poisson regression (with a robust error structure [28]) with a binary outcome (indicating
whether or not the person reached the given cascade step) for each cascade step, whereby the

 sample for each regression was all individuals aged 15 to 49 years with hypertension. We pre-
ferred Poisson over logistic regression because odds ratios are frequently misinterpreted as
risk ratios (RRs) [29], which matters when the outcome is common (as is the case in this analy-
sis) because the RR then differs substantially from the odds ratio. In our primary regression
approach, we categorized age, BMI, and the household wealth index to allow for an easier
interpretation of the RRs. However, to avoid the loss of information from categorizing a con-
tinuous variable, we also show our regression results when using continuous age, BMI, and
household wealth index in S1 Supplemental Materials, and plot the predicted probabilities
from this regression in the main paper. For this analysis, we used restricted cubic splines with
5 knots for each of the 3 continuous variables. The knots were placed at the fifth, 27.5th, 50th,
72.5th, and 95th percentiles of each variable. All regression models in this paper included fixed
effects for all 640 districts in India to filter out district-level effects on the outcome variables.
We adjusted the standard errors in the regression models for clustering at the primary sam-
pling unit level because primary sampling units were the largest sampling unit in the survey
[30]. This was a complete case analysis. R software (version 3.3.2; R Foundation) was used for
all statistical analyses.
None of the analyses presented in this paper were prespecified. The decision to display
state-level care cascade indicators by state GDP per capita was made during data analysis. All
other analyses were planned.
Ethics
This analysis received a determination of “not human subjects research” by the institutional
review board of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health on 9 May 2018 because the
authors had access to de-identified data only. None of the authors were involved in the data
collection of the NFHS-4. IIPS—the implementer of the NFHS-4—has made the micro-data of
this survey publicly accessible through the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) Program
(see Data Availability statement). As per standard DHS data access procedures, we registered
our study with the DHS Program, which involved a brief description of our research project.
The DHS Program then made the de-identified micro-data available to us for download. In
the original survey, written informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to
administering the questionnaires.
Results
Sample characteristics
The NFHS-4 household survey consisted of 749,119 participants (647,451 women and 101,668
men) when including only individuals aged 15–49 years and excluding pregnant women. Of
these participants, 2.3% (17,255/749,119) had a missing BP measurement or response to the
outcome-defining survey questions. Those with a missing outcome variable were more likely
to be male, live in an urban area, have a higher educational attainment, and live in a household
with more wealth than those with non-missing values (Table A, S1 Supplemental Materials).
Participants with a missing outcome variable were excluded, resulting in a sample of 731,864
participants (633,608 women and 98,256 men) for the analysis. In total, 17.8% (unweighted) of
participants had hypertension (Table 1), 49.4% were younger than 30 years, 32.4% did not fin-
ish primary school, 68.7% were married, and 29.6% lived in urban areas. None of the 731,864
included participants had missing values for any of the characteristics shown in Table 1, except
for BMI (1,037 [0.1%] missing values).

 The hypertension care cascade at the national level
The national prevalence of hypertension in the sampled age range was 18.1% (95% CI 17.8%–
18.4%). Men had a somewhat higher prevalence than women (19.0%, 95% CI 18.5%–19.5%,
compared to 17.2%, 95% CI 16.9%–17.4%). Hypertension prevalence estimates by age group
and sex are shown in Table B in S1 Supplemental Materials. Among hypertensive individuals,
76.1% (95% CI 75.3%–76.8%) had ever received a BP measurement (“screened”), 44.7% (95%
CI 43.6%–45.8%) had been diagnosed prior to the survey (“aware”), 13.3% (95% CI 12.9%–
13.8%) reported currently taking a prescribed antihypertensive drug (“treated”), and 7.9%
(95% CI 7.6%–8.3%) were on treatment and had a normal BP (“controlled”). Women and par-
ticipants living in urban areas were more likely to reach each step of the care cascade (Fig 1).

(95% CI 69.8%–88.1%) in Puducherry; treated hypertension, from 7.1% (95% CI 5.9%–8.5%)
in Jharkhand to 24.7% (95% CI 20.8%–29.9%) in Meghalaya; and controlled hypertension,
from 2.4% (95% CI 1.7%–3.3%) in Nagaland to 21.0% (95% CI 9.8%–39.6%) in Daman and
Diu (Tables D–G, S1 Supplemental Materials). Hypertension prevalence ranged from 12.8%
(95% CI 12.0%–13.7%) in Bihar to 40.0% (95% CI 32.4%–48.1%) in Puducherry (Fig B and
Table H, S1 Supplemental Materials).
States with higher GDP per capita tended to perform better on the screening cascade step
(Fig 3). The only states that performed better in at least 3 out of 4 cascade steps than would be
expected based on their GDP per capita were Jammu and Kashmir, and Kerala. Chhattisgarh
and Nagaland were the only states that performed worse in at least 3 out of 4 cascade steps
than predicted based on GDP per capita.
In Puducherry, 38.0% (95% CI 36.3%–38.9%) of the total population aged 15 to 49 years
had uncontrolled hypertension (i.e., had hypertension but did not reach the “controlled”
step of the hypertension care cascade), followed by Tamil Nadu (28.8%, 95% CI 28.5%–
29.2%), Sikkim (28.4%, 95% CI 27.7%–29.0%), and Haryana (28.4%, 95% CI 27.8%–29.0%)
(Tables M–Q, S1 Supplemental Materials). The highest absolute number of adults in this
age range who had uncontrolled hypertension lived in Uttar Pradesh (14,267,516, 95% CI
14,162,771–14,363,058), Tamil Nadu (12,820,905, 95% CI 12,656,563–12,962,861), and
Maharashtra (10,896,960, 95% CI 10,641,607–11,109,137) (Tables R–V, S1 Supplemental
Materials).

These Poisson regressions contained all variables listed in the table (age group, household wealth quintile, education, BMI, tobacco consumption, marital status, and
sex) and a binary indicator for each district (district-level fixed effects) as predictor variables. Standard errors were adjusted for clustering at the level of the primary
sampling unit. Regression results including an interaction term between marital status and sex, using sampling weights (to account for the higher number of sampled
women), and running analyses separately for women and men can be found in Tables X–AA in S1 Supplemental Materials. The sample for each regression was all
individuals with hypertension (i.e., the sample was not restricted to those who had reached the preceding cascade step).

 association with treatment and control; (vi) being obese (BMI � 30.0 kg/m2) was associated
with a higher likelihood of reaching the “treated” step and, in urban areas, also the “controlled”
step; and (vii) tobacco consumption was generally not associated with substantial differences
in the likelihood of progressing through the care cascade. In addition, those who were married
had a higher likelihood of completing each care cascade step, with the association generally
not differing between men and women (Table X, S1 Supplemental Materials). The regression
results were similar when using sampling weights (Table Y, S1 Supplemental Materials), when
running the analysis separately for men and women (Tables Z–AA, S1 Supplemental Materi-
als), and when fitting covariate-unadjusted rather than covariate-adjusted regressions (Tables
AB–AE, S1 Supplemental Materials).
Fig 4 shows that the probability of ever having had one’s BP measured increased with age
until approximately age 25 years and that there appears to be an exponential positive associa-
tion between age and the probability of being treated. The associations between age and the
“aware” and “controlled” cascade steps are flat. Household wealth index has an approximately
linear positive association with each cascade step. The association between BMI and each cas-
cade step is flat or negative in the normal BMI range, and approximately linear and positive in
the overweight and obese range. Table AF in S1 Supplemental Materials shows the RRs accom-
panying the predicted probabilities shown in Fig 4.
Discussion
In this nationally representative sample of 731,864 adults aged 15–49 years in India, we found
that while the proportion of those with hypertension who had ever had their BP measured was
high (76%), less than half (45%) of individuals with the condition were aware of their diagno-
sis, less than 1 in 7 (13%) reported currently taking BP-lowering medication, and less than 1 in
10 (8%) had achieved control. Thus, the highest absolute losses to care occurred at the aware-
ness (31.4 percentage points) and treatment (31.4 percentage points) stages, and the highest
relative loss at the treatment stage (70.3%). While improvements are needed along the entire
Fig 4. The predicted probability of reaching each cascade step by age, household wealth index, and BMI as continuous variables. Predicted probabilities were
obtained from covariate-adjusted logistic regressions of hypertension care indicators on individuals’ sociodemographic characteristics (age, household wealth index,
education, marital status, sex, rural versus urban location, BMI, tobacco consumption [smoking], and tobacco consumption [smokeless]) and district-level fixed effects.
We used restricted cubic splines with 5 knots for each continuous variable (age, household wealth index, and BMI). Higher household wealth index values indicate more
household wealth. A detailed description of all the household characteristics and assets included in this index can be found in Methods C in S1 Supplemental Materials.
The grey histogram in the background represents the distribution of the variable on the x-axis, whereby the height of the histogram bars does not correspond to the
percentages on the y-axis. The sample for each regression was all individuals with hypertension (i.e., the sample was not restricted to those who had reached the
preceding cascade step).

 hypertension care cascade, this highlights a particular need for interventions that focus on the
awareness and treatment steps of the cascade.
The country-level analysis of the hypertension care cascade, however, disguises the large
variation in the care cascades among states and population groups. Specifically, we found
worse values for each of the care cascade steps for men, those in lower household wealth quin-
tiles, and those living in rural areas. These populations thus form important target groups for
appropriate interventions, particularly because households with lower household wealth in
rural areas are less likely to be able to access high-quality care for a CVD event, such as myo-
cardial infarction, and more likely to experience catastrophic healthcare expenditures from
such an event than their wealthier counterparts in urban areas.
Among states, we found that the proportion of adults with hypertension who were treated
and whose hypertension was controlled varied by a factor of 3.5 and 8.8, respectively. Chhattis-
garh and Nagaland performed worse than expected based on GDP per capita on at least 3 out
of 4 cascade steps. Identifying and adopting some of the policies and programs that have
allowed equally wealthy (or even poorer) states to perform better may well prove effective in
increasing health system performance for managing hypertension in poorly performing states
such as Chhattisgarh and Nagaland. “Role model” states could include Jammu and Kashmir
and Kerala, which performed better than predicted based on GDP per capita in at least 3 out of
4 care cascade steps. Other states where improvements in managing adults with hypertension
are particularly urgently needed are those in which a large proportion of the general popula-
tion had hypertension but did not reach the control step of the care cascade (“uncontrolled
hypertension”), such as Puducherry (38.0%), Tamil Nadu (28.8%), Sikkim (28.4%), and Hary-
ana (28.4%). However, India’s states vary enormously in size, and thus large states with rela-
tively low hypertension prevalence may still host a high absolute number of adults with
uncontrolled hypertension. In fact, Uttar Pradesh, which had one of the lowest prevalence lev-
els for hypertension in the observed age group (14.4%, 95% CI 13.9%–14.9%), had the highest
estimated absolute number of adults (14,267,516) with uncontrolled hypertension. Lastly, a
priority state for improving hypertension care should be Tamil Nadu, which had both the sec-
ond highest proportion of adults aged 15 to 49 years with uncontrolled hypertension (28.8%)
and the second highest absolute number of adults in that age range with uncontrolled hyper-
tension (12,820,905).
While this analysis of data collected by the NFHS-4 team is to our knowledge the first large-
scale population-based study of hypertension care in India, a systematic review and meta-anal-
ysis published in 2014 summarized 29 local studies in India that analyzed hypertension aware-
ness, treatment, and control [8]. It estimated a lower probability of hypertension awareness
(rural areas: 25.1%, 95% CI 21.0%–29.1%; urban areas: 41.9%, 95% CI 35.1%–48.9%) than this
study (rural: 42.5%, 95% CI 41.2%–43.7%; urban: 47.9%, 95% CI 45.9%–49.9%). However, the
estimates for both percentage treated (rural: 24.9%, 95% CI 16.7–33.0; urban: 37.6%, 95% CI
23.9%–51.2%) and percentage with controlled hypertension (rural: 10.7%, 95% CI 6.4%–
15.0%; urban: 20.2%, 95% CI 11.6%–28.8%) were substantially higher than in this study
(treated/rural: 12.3%, 95% CI 11.8%–12.8%; treated/urban: 14.9%, 95% CI 14.0%–15.8%; con-
trolled/rural: 7.7%, 95% CI 7.3%–8.0%; controlled/urban: 8.3%, 95% CI 7.6%–9.0%). Several
other local studies published since that review have also reported on these hypertension care
indicators, with results that are similar to ours [13,34–37]. Our hypertension prevalence esti-
mates are consistent with the most recent prevalence estimates for India among individuals
aged 15 to 49 years, from an analysis of the Annual Health Survey and fourth District Level
Household Survey [5]. In particular, this study also found a comparatively high hypertension
prevalence, even among the youngest age group sampled (e.g., 9.6% [95% CI 9.3%–9.9%]
among those aged 15 to 29 years). While these young individuals are unlikely to experience a

 CVD event in the near future, this finding suggests a worrying state of metabolic health among
younger adults in India, which in turn may foreshadow a high CVD incidence in the coming
decades as this cohort of younger adults reaches older ages.
The only cascade step reported on in the official NFHS-4 report is the proportion of those
with diagnosed hypertension (in our analysis described as “aware”) who reported currently
taking antihypertensive medications (treated). This conditional proportion is 29% in our anal-
ysis (see flowchart of Fig A in S1 Supplemental Materials) compared to “about one-third” in
the NFHS-4 report [16]. The discrepancy might be due to the use of different sampling weights
or minor changes in the dataset between the official NFHS-4 analysis and the dissemination of
the data through the DHS Program. For full transparency, we have made all cleaning and anal-
ysis code of this study publicly accessible (see Data Availability statement). When using the
hypertension definition employed by the NFHS-4 report (raised BP or reporting being
treated), our hypertension prevalence estimates are very similar to those in the NFHS-4 report
(11% and 12% for women and 15% and 16% for men in the NFHS-4 report and our analysis,
respectively).
This study has several limitations. First, only adults aged 15–49 years were included in this
analysis. Thus, our findings are not representative of the entire adult population in India.
Nonetheless, given that India has a relatively young population, the age groups represented in
this study accounted for 75.2% of all people in India aged �15 years in 2015 [38]. The lower
age of participants in this sample is also largely responsible for the lower hypertension preva-
lence observed in this study compared to the nationally representative study among an older
sample that our team published recently [5]. Second, because of the NFHS-4’s focus on mater-
nal and child health, the survey sampled substantially fewer men than women. However, with
98,256 men included in the analysis, the absolute number of men sampled was still sufficient
to obtain reasonably precise estimates of hypertension care cascade indicators among men. In
addition, we adjusted our sampling weights to the sex distribution of India’s population in
each 1-year age group to ensure that our estimates were representative for India’s adult popula-
tion between the ages of 15 and 49 years despite the oversampling of women. Third, the defini-
tion of hypertension in this study was based on 3 BP measurements taken during 1 occasion,
while a clinical diagnosis of hypertension requires raised BP measurements on at least 2 differ-
ent occasions [22,39]. Falsely categorizing some adults as hypertensive who are normotensive
would result in underestimates for “aware,” “treated,” and “controlled.” Fourth, 2.3% of partic-
ipants had a missing value for at least 1 of the variables needed to define hypertension and
each of the hypertension care cascade steps. While the percent missing is relatively small, those
with a missing outcome variable are likely to have had a different probability of having hyper-
tension and of reaching each step in the care cascade than those included in the analysis, as
suggested by the fact that their sociodemographic characteristics were different (Table A, S1
Supplemental Materials). Fifth, the questions asked in the NFHS-4 questionnaire did not allow
us to ascertain who among those diagnosed with hypertension had received relevant lifestyle
advice. Given that our construction of the hypertension care cascade imposed the requirement
that a participant must have reached all previous cascade steps to reach the next cascade step,
only those who were treated could achieve control. Thus, participants who were diagnosed
with hypertension and subsequently achieved hypertension control through lifestyle changes
rather than medication were not considered to have controlled hypertension in this study. Our
analysis, therefore, likely underestimates the percent of those with hypertension who achieved
control. Lastly, the question “Before this survey, has your blood pressure ever been checked?”
that defined the outcome “screened” does not quantify the number, or determine the regular-
ity, of BP measurements received prior to the survey. Our estimate of “screened” should there-
fore be interpreted as the percentage who have ever had their BP measured (whether for

 hypertension screening or in other clinical interactions) rather than as the percentage who
have been screened recently or on a regular basis since reaching a certain age.
In conclusion, the proportion of adults with hypertension in India who are aware of their diag-
nosis, are on treatment, and have the condition controlled is low. However, this study not only sets
a benchmark for India as a whole to measure future progress; rather, by providing a detailed analy-
sis of how the hypertension care cascade varies among population groups and states, this study can
inform the selection of target groups and the design of appropriate interventions to improve
hypertension care. In particular, India needs to urgently improve hypertension control among
households with lower levels of wealth and those living in rural areas, which will likely need to
include access to low-cost or free antihypertensive medications. A further important target group
is men. Since India forms 18% of the world’s population and is expected to be the world’s most
populous country by 2025, India’s ability to improve hypertension care will have a decisive impact
on the world’s ability to achieve international NCD goals, including the Sustainable Development
Goals and the WHO’s Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of NCDs [10,38,40].
