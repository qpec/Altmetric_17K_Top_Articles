Context: Unexplained infertility (UI), defined as the inability to conceive after 12 months of un-
protected intercourse with no diagnosed cause, affects 10% to 30% of infertile couples. An im-
proved understanding of the mechanisms underlying UI could lead to less invasive and less costly
treatment strategies. Abnormalities in thyroid function and hyperprolactinemia are well-known
causes of infertility, but whether thyrotropin (TSH) and prolactin levels within the normal range are
associated with UI is unknown.
Objective: To compare TSH and prolactin levels in women with UI and women with a normal fertility
evaluation except for an azoospermic or severely oligospermic male partner.
Design, Setting, and Participants: Cross-sectional study including women evaluated at a large academic
health system between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2012 with normal TSH (levels within the normal
range of the assay and #5 mIU/L) and normal prolactin levels (#20 ng/mL) and either UI (n = 187) or no
other cause of infertility other than an azoospermic or severely oligospermic partner (n = 52).
Main Outcome Measures: TSH and prolactin.
Results: Women with UI had significantly higher TSH levels than controls [UI: TSH 1.95 mIU/L,
interquartile range: (1.54, 2.61); severe male factor: TSH 1.66 mIU/L, interquartile range: (1.25, 2.17);
P = 0.003]. This finding remained significant after we controlled for age, body mass index, and
smoking status. Nearly twice as many women with UI (26.9%) had a TSH $2.5 mIU/L compared with
controls (13.5%; P , 0.05). Prolactin levels did not differ between the groups.
Conclusions: Women with UI have higher TSH levels compared with a control population. More
studies are necessary to determine whether treatment of high-normal TSH levels decreases time to
conception in couples with UI. (J Clin Endocrinol Metab 103: 632–639, 2018)
I
nfertility, defined as the inability to conceive after
12 months of regular unprotected intercourse (1),
affects ~7% to 15.5% of reproductive-aged women in
the United States (2). Although a cause for infertility is
identified in the majority of couples, ~10% to 30%
have unexplained or idiopathic infertility, which is
defined as infertility in the setting of regular ovulation,
tubal patency, a normal uterine cavity, and normal
semen analysis (3–6). Unexplained infertility (UI) is
associated with high emotional and economic costs;
annual US expenditures for all forms of infertility to-
tal $3 to $4 billion/y (7), and couples with UI have
higher conception rates with in vitro fertilization (IVF),
one of the most expensive forms of treatment (8).
Therefore, gaining a greater understanding of potential
hormonal factors that may contribute to UI may lead to
more economical and effective treatment strategies for
these couples.

 Known causes of infertility include hyperprolactinemia
and thyroid dysfunction (9, 10). Hyperprolactinemia is
a common cause of amenorrhea and infertility, due to
impaired gonadotropin secretion and pulsatility, likely
caused by impaired gonadotropin-releasing hormone se-
cretion (11, 12). Treatment with dopamine agonist ther-
apy has been shown to restore ovulation and fertility
in women with hyperprolactinemia (13–16). Importantly,
even hyperprolactinemic women with regular men-
strual cycles may experience decreased fertility be-
cause of a shortened luteal phase (17–19), but whether
high-normal levels of prolactin in women with no
known history of hyperprolactinemia may affect fertility
remains unknown.
Murine and in vitro studies suggest that thyrotro-
pin (TSH) and thyroid hormone are important fac-
tors during oocyte development and implantation
(20–23). In humans, an in vivo model also suggests the
importance of TSH for oocyte development, as TSH
levels $2.5 mIU/L in oocyte donors inversely predict
clinical pregnancy independent of the recipient’s TSH
level (24). Both hyperthyroidism (25) and hypothyroid-
ism are associated with menstrual irregularity (26), and
rates of infertility have been reported to approach 50% in
women with Hashimoto thyroiditis and Graves disease
(27). A higher percentage of women with infertility have
also been shown to have frankly abnormal TSH levels as
compared with controls (28), and the recent American
Thyroid Association Thyroid and Pregnancy Guidelines
recommend checking TSH in all women seeking evalu-
ation for infertility (29). However, whether higher TSH
levels in a population of women with a normal TSH and
no known history of thyroid disease are part of the UI
phenotype remains an unanswered question.
There is no consensus on the definition of subclini-
cal hypothyroidism in nonpregnant women who are
attempting to conceive. Subclinical hypothyroidism is
defined as an elevated TSH level in the setting of normal
thyroid hormone levels, but what the upper limit of
normal should be for TSH is controversial. Based on the
National Health and Nutrition Examination III survey
including a sample of 8619 girls and women ($12 years
of age) in the United States without a history of thyroid
disease, the median TSH level is 1.50 mIU/L, with an
upper 97.5 percentile of 6.10 mIU/L (30), whereas others
argue that the upper limit of normal for TSH should be
2.5 mIU/L, based on data from the National Academy of
Clinical Biochemistry that indicate that 95% of people
without evidence of thyroid autoimmunity and without
a personal or family history of thyroid disease have a TSH
level #2.5 mIU/L (31) and the fact that TSH levels
$2.5 mIU/L have been associated with adverse obstetrical
outcomes including increased risk of pregnancy loss (32).
Therefore, there is poor consensus regarding the normal
range for nonpregnant women who are attempting to
conceive, although current guidelines provide an upper
limit of normal for TSH of 4 mIU/L for women in
their first trimester of pregnancy, a time when TSH
levels should be at their lowest because of human cho-
rionic gonadotropin stimulation of thyroid hormone
(29), suggesting that the upper limit of normal for non-
pregnant women is .4 mIU/L. Furthermore, current
guidelines do not recommend treating women with
subclinical hypothyroidism, who are attempting to con-
ceive naturally, with thyroid hormone replacement to
improve the likelihood of conception (29, 33). Our goal
in performing this study was to understand whether
thyroid function, as estimated by TSH, is associated with
infertility in women with a completely normal fertility
evaluation who do not have a history of thyroid disease or
abnormal thyroid function tests. We hypothesized that
women with UI would have higher TSH and higher
prolactin levels, within the normal range, as compared
with a control group of women who had a similarly
normal infertility evaluation but whose partners were
found to be azoospermic or severely oligospermic.
Methods
Study population
Using the patient database registry at a large academic
health system (the Research Patient Data Registry of Partners
HealthCare system), we obtained data on female patients be-
tween 18 and 39 years of age who presented to the Partners
HealthCare system with the diagnosis of infertility and
without a disorder of menstruation between 1 January 2000
and 31 December 2012. All electronic records were then in-
dividually reviewed to ensure that the women met our inclusion
and exclusion criteria. Women were included who did not
conceive after $1 year with appropriate exposure to sperm (UI
group) or who had inadequate exposure to sperm due to a male
partner with azoospermia (n = 39) or severe oligospermia (n =
13) with a sperm count ,1 million/mL (severe male factor).
Inclusion criteria for all women included regular menstrual
cycles every 21 to 35 days with #5 days of intercycle variability,
normal uterine cavity evaluation, menstrual cycle day 3 follicle-
stimulating
hormone
(FSH)
#10
IU/mL
with
concomi-
tant estradiol level of #80 pg/mL (34), TSH level within the
normal range of the assay and #5 mIU/L, and prolactin
level #20 ng/mL. Male partners of women with UI had semen
concentration $15 million/mL, motility $40%, and normal
forms $4% (where strict Tygerberg analysis was available),
based on World Health Organization 2010 criteria (35), re-
gardless of the year of evaluation. If strict Tygerberg (36)
evaluation of sperm was not available, subjects were not ex-
cluded based on percentage of abnormal forms. Male partners
of women in the severe male factor group had semen concen-
trations ,1 million/mL on at least two occasions. We excluded
women with history of hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism
(including postpartum thyroiditis or history of an abnormal

 TSH level), history of a high prolactin level, body mass index
(BMI) ,18.5 kg/m2 or $40 kg/m2, women with recurrent
pregnancy loss (three or more miscarriages), women with ab-
normalities that may be associated with reproduction (e.g.,
complex ovarian cysts, previous ovarian surgery, cervical ste-
nosis, endometriosis, or endometritis), or a strong suspicion by
the evaluating physician of an endocrine disorder, including
polycystic ovary syndrome. This study was approved by the
Partners HealthCare institutional review board.
Laboratory assessment
All diagnostic and laboratory testing was performed as
part of routine clinical care. TSH and prolactin levels were
measured in one of four hospital laboratories within the Part-
ners HealthCare system for .75% of patients. The remaining
patients had a TSH or prolactin level checked at a known
outside laboratory for which method information was available
or an outside facility for which assay and method information
was not available (14.6% of patients). The upper limit of
normal for two of the TSH assays was ,5 mIU/L, and in this
case we included only patients who had a TSH within the
normal range of the assay. There were two TSH assays with an
upper limit of normal of .5 mIU/L, and in this case we included
only patients with a TSH #5 mIU/L.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using JMP Pro 11.0 (SAS
Institute, Cary, NC) software. Means and standard deviation
measurements are reported and compared using the Student’s t
test unless the data were nonnormally distributed, in which case
medians and first and third quartile ranges are presented and
compared via the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Percentages were
compared using the Fisher exact test or the Pearson x2 test.
Least-squares linear regression modeling was performed to
control for clinically relevant covariates. TSH was log trans-
formed for the regression analyses due to nonnormality.
P ,0.05 on a two-tailed test was used to indicate statistical
significance.
Results
Clinical characteristics
A total of 239 women met our inclusion and exclusion
criteria: 187 women with UI and 52 with severe male
factor infertility. Subjects in the two groups were similarly
distributed across the 13-year study period (P = 0.69).
Characteristics of the study participants are listed in
Table 1. Subjects in the UI group were slightly older than
subjects in the severe male factor group (mean age 6
standard deviation: UI, 31.5 6 2.7 years; severe male
factor, 30.1 6 3.7 years; P = 0.01). Median BMI was
lower in the UI group as compared with the severe male
factor group [UI median BMI 23.0 kg/m2, interquartile
range: (20.9, 26.2); severe male factor median BMI
24.4 kg/m2, interquartile range: (22.2, 27.0); P , 0.04],
and the percentage of women with a BMI $25 kg/m2 was
lower in the UI group than in the severe male factor
group, although this difference was not statistically sig-
nificant (P = 0.24). Median duration of infertility and
mean day 3 FSH levels were similar in both groups.
TSH and prolactin levels
TSH
Median TSH levels were significantly greater in the UI
group than in the severe male factor group [UI median
TSH 1.95 mIU/L, interquartile range: (1.54, 2.61); severe
male factor TSH 1.66 mIU/L, interquartile range: (1.25,
2.17); P = 0.003] (Fig. 1). TSH levels remained signifi-
cantly higher in the UI group when we controlled for both
BMI (P , 0.02) and age (P , 0.01), variables that have
been positively associated with TSH in previous studies
(37–41). Although smoking status was not significantly
different between the groups, both past and a current
history of cigarette smoking are associated with lower
TSH levels (42). Therefore, we also controlled for both
current history of smoking and past or current history of
smoking, and TSH remained significantly higher in the UI
group than in the severe male factor group (P , 0.01
for both).
After we excluded women from the UI group whose
partner had a low morphology based on methods that did
not use strict (Tygerberg) criteria (n = 19), TSH levels
remained significantly higher in the UI group than in
Table 1.

TSH in Unexplained Infertility
J Clin Endocrinol Metab, February 2018, 103(2):632–639

 the severe male factor group [UI TSH 1.96 mIU/L,
interquartile range: (1.54, 2.61); severe male factor
TSH 1.66 mIU/L, interquartile range: (1.25, 2.17); P ,
0.01] and regression analyses similarly remained signif-
icant (P # 0.01 for all).
Significantly more women in the UI group had TSH
values $2.5 mIU/L as compared with women in the se-
vere male factor group (Fig. 2). The percentage of women
in the UI group with a TSH $2.5 mIU/L was nearly twice
the percentage in the severe male factor group (UI 26.9%,
severe male factor 13.5%; P , 0.05). Of the 57 total
patients who had a TSH $2.5 mIU/L, 22.8% (13 pa-
tients) were started on thyroid hormone replacement
therapy after their initial evaluation, although it is not
known whether patients were initiated on thyroid hor-
mone replacement to prevent adverse obstetrical out-
comes if they were to conceive or in an attempt to improve
the likelihood of conception.
To exclude the possibility that the observed differ-
ences were due to changes in assay methods or labo-
ratory procedures, we divided patients into groups
depending on where their TSH level was measured
(which hospital or laboratory) and which assay was
used. In one case, two laboratories used the same TSH
assay, but patients who had their TSH measured with
this assay were divided into two separate groups be-
cause there may have been systematic differences be-
tween the hospital laboratories that could have led to
differences in TSH levels. Table 2 shows the percentage
of women with UI and severe male factor in each of the
laboratory and assay groupings. Although the overall
x2 test did not detect a difference between the groups
with respect to where and how TSH was measured (P =
0.48), we performed individual significance testing to
ensure that we were not missing differences. With in-
dividual testing, we found that a significantly higher
percentage of subjects in the severe male factor group
had a TSH level measured in one laboratory/assay
(group 4) compared with subjects with UI (P = 0.04).
When we excluded patients from laboratory/assay
group 4 and those who had their TSH measured with
an unknown assay, the observed differences in TSH
levels remained significant; the TSH level in the UI
group (n = 130) was significantly higher than that of the
severe male factor group (n = 30) [UI TSH 1.94 mIU/L,
interquartile range: (1.52, 2.54); severe male factor
TSH 1.72 mIU/L, interquartile range: (1.32, 2.00); P =
0.01], and a significantly higher percentage of women
with UI had a TSH $2.5 mIU/L compared with those
with severe male factor infertility (25.4% vs 6.7%,
P , 0.03).
Thyroid peroxidase antibodies
Only 19 of the 239 women in the study had thyroid
peroxidase (TPO) antibodies assessed around the time of
their infertility evaluation. Of these 19 women, 6 had an
elevated TPO antibody level (3 in the UI group and 3 in
the severe male factor group). Median TPO antibody levels
were significantly higher in the severe male factor group
than in the UI group [UI TPO antibody 13.3 IU/mL,
interquartile range: (10.2, 18); severe male factor TPO
antibody 90.4 IU/mL, interquartile range: (18.4, 2994.3);
P = 0.03]. When the six subjects with a positive TPO
antibody were excluded from the TSH analyses, the results
remainedsignificant, with a higher median TSH level in the
UI group [1.95 mIU/L, interquartile range: (1.52, 2.58)] as
compared with the severe male factor group [1.69 mIU/L,
interquartile range: (1.22, 2.16); P , 0.01] and a signif-
icantly higher percentage of subjects with a TSH $2.5
mIU/L in the UI group (26%) than in the severe male factor
group (12%; P , 0.04).

median and first and third quartiles. Dotted line represents a TSH of

 Prolactin
Prolactin levels were similar in the UI group and the
severe male factor group [UI prolactin 10.4 ng/mL,
interquartile range: (7.7, 13.4); severe male factor pro-
lactin 11 ng/mL, interquartile range: (8.5, 13.7); P =
0.36]. Because prolactin levels may vary during the
menstrual cycle (43, 44), we performed an analysis in-
cluding only women who had prolactin measured on day
3 of their menstrual cycle (n = 180), and the results were
similar [UI prolactin 10.8 ng/mL, interquartile range:
(8.1, 13.7); severe male factor prolactin 12.5 ng/mL,
interquartile range: (9.2, 14.5); P = 0.20]. There were
no significant differences between the groups with respect
to method of prolactin measurement (P = 0.82; Supple-
mental Table 1).
Discussion
We have shown that women with UI have significantly
higher TSH levels than a control group of women with a
comparatively normal fertility evaluation except for an
azoospermic or severely oligospermic partner. Similarly,
nearly twice as many women with UI have TSH levels
$2.5 mIU/L as compared with the control group. Im-
portantly, all subjects in this study had TSH levels within
the normal, prepregnancy reference range, suggesting
that even mild variations of thyroid dysfunction within
the normal range may be an important factor in fer-
tility in women who have no known cause for their
infertility.
Thyroid disease is a known cause of menstrual ir-
regularity and infertility (9). A number of previous studies
have investigated the relationship between TSH and
conception rates or time to pregnancy with conflicting
results; a TSH $2.5 mIU/L has not been associated
with increased time to pregnancy in women with proven
fecundity (and without a history of infertility) (45) or
with adverse intrauterine insemination outcomes (46),
whereas in a large population-based study including
women with thyroid dysfunction, higher TSH levels were
associated with fewer total pregnancies (47).
Previous studies have also investigated the percent-
age of women with abnormal TSH levels or subclini-
cal hypothyroidism in different types of infertility.
Abalovich et al. (48) found a higher rate of subclinical
hypothyroidism (defined as a TSH .4.22 mIU/L or a
TSH .26.6 mIU/L in response to 200 mg of intravenous
TSH-releasing hormone stimulation) in women with
premature ovarian insufficiency, tubal disease, and
ovulatory dysfunction compared with fertile women, but
none of the women with UI was diagnosed with sub-
clinical hypothyroidism. A second study from Finland
looked at the rate of frankly abnormal TSH levels in
women diagnosed with infertility and found that 6.3% of
women in the ovulatory dysfunction group and 4.8%
of women in the UI group had an elevated TSH (28). Our
study differs from these previous studies in that we used
very strict criteria to ensure our subjects had completely
normal fertility evaluations (other than azoospermia or
severe oligospermia in the control group) and no known
history of thyroid disease or abnormal thyroid function
tests. All subjects in both groups in our study had regular
menstrual cycles, ,35 days in length, with #5 days of
intercycle variability, normal uterine evaluations, and
normal hormonal profiles. In the UI group, male partners
had a normal semen analysis (35). The purpose of our
strict inclusion and exclusion criteria was to assess
whether mild variations in thyroid function or circulating
prolactin levels contribute to the phenotype of UI.
Because we did not require proven fecundity as a criterion
for the severe male factor group, our choice of control group
probably biased our result toward the null hypothesis, be-
cause it is possible that some of the women in the severe
male factor group would have been classified as having UI
had they been with a partner with a normal semen profile.
Therefore, the fact that we found a difference in TSH levels,

TSH in Unexplained Infertility

 despite this choice of control group, only adds to the strength
of our findings. We also did not use a population of couples
with less severe forms of male factor infertility as our
control group, which would have yielded a much larger
number of controls. The definition of male factor infertility
has changed over the years, with the lower limit of most
semen parameters being lower in current as compared
with previous reference ranges (35). Therefore, including a
population of couples over a span of 13 years, with a
changing definition of male infertility, would have been
problematic. Second, a previous study found that in a
population of couples who underwent IVF, TSH levels were
significantly higher in women with a male partner with male
factor infertility as compared with other types of infertility,
including ovulatory and tubal factors (49). The authors
hypothesized that this is likely due to the fact that in couples
diagnosed with mild male factor infertility, female factors
also contribute to the diagnosis of infertility, supported by
previous studies demonstrating that female partners of men
with poor semen factors have lower fertilization rates using
donor sperm as compared with female partners of azoo-
spermic men (49–51). Given the complicated relationship
between mild male factor infertility and female hormonal
status, we included only couples with azoospermia or severe
oligospermia in our analysis.
We also hypothesized that women with UI would
have higher prolactin levels (within the normal range)
as compared with the control group. A previous study
demonstrated higher prolactin levels in ovulating women
with infertility of an unknown cause as compared with a
control group of fertile women, and treatment with a
dopamine agonist resulted in conception in 16 of the 40
infertile women during the 10 months of follow-up (52).
On the other hand, a more recent Cochrane review
combining data from three double-blind, randomized
trials of 127 women with UI treated with bromocriptine
or placebo found no benefit in conception rates in the
bromocriptine-treated group (53). In our study, we did
not find a significant difference in prolactin levels in
women with UI as compared with severe male factor
infertility. Importantly, prolactin levels are exquisitely
sensitive to environmental influences including stress (54)
and food intake (55) and have been shown to be highest
during the ovulatory and luteal phases of the menstrual
cycle (43, 44). We attempted to control for some of this
potential variability by including only prolactin levels
measured on day 3 of the menstrual cycle, but it is
possible that even if there was a difference between
groups, we did not detect it because of the variability
we were not able to control for. To determine whether
prolactin levels contribute to the phenotype of UI, future
studies will need to measure prolactin levels in a carefully
controlled setting.
Strengths of our study include our very strict inclusion
and exclusion criteria, which allowed us to control for
other possible factors contributing to infertility. Impor-
tantly, our control group consisted of a population of
women who had a similarly rigorous fertility evaluation
compared with the UI group. The main limitation of this
study is that we relied on health records and therefore
we were limited to laboratory tests that were drawn for
clinical purposes. Therefore, we could not measure
thyroid antibody levels or thyroid hormone levels in our
subjects, and a previous meta-analysis demonstrated an
increased rate of infertility in women who were thyroid
antibody positive (56). Of the 239 women included in our
study, only 19 had TPO antibodies checked around the
time of their infertility evaluation.
In conclusion, TSH levels are significantly higher in a
population of women without known thyroid dysfunc-
tion and with UI as compared with a control group. The
fact that nearly 27% of women with UI have TSH
levels $2.5 mIU/L as compared with 13.5% of women in
the control group suggests that mild abnormalities in thyroid
function may contribute to some cases of UI. It also raises the
question of whether treatment with thyroid hormone re-
placement for women with TSH levels $2.5 mIU/L may be
an economical first step in treating UI, especially for this
population for whom early use of IVF, a resource-intensive
treatment, has been shown to result in higher conception
rates (8). Although current practice guidelines do not rec-
ommend treating women with a TSH $2.5 mIU/L who are
attempting to conceive naturally (29, 33), some practitioners
use this lower cutoff to initiate treatment. Our data dem-
onstrate that 22.8% of patients with a TSH $2.5 mIU/L
were started on thyroid hormone replacement after their
initial evaluation and therefore .75% of patients were
not, demonstrating the great variance in clinical practice
and the need for more data. Therefore, future studies will
be necessary to determine whether treatment of high-
normal TSH levels decreases time to conception in
couples with UI.
