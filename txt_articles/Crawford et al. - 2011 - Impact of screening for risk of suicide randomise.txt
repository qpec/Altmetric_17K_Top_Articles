 Suicide is a major cause of premature mortality, which results in
over 1 million deaths worldwide per year.1 Previous research
demonstrating high levels of contact with primary care in the
period prior to completed suicide2–4 has highlighted the role that
such services might play in efforts to reduce the incidence of
suicide.5 A central component of guidelines for the assessment
and treatment of depression in primary care is asking patients
about suicidal ideas and intent.6 Despite the emphasis placed on
screening for risk of suicide among people with signs of
depression, studies have found low levels of assessment among
people treated in primary care.7–9 Reasons for this include
concerns about the impact on patients of being asked such
questions.8,10
In
a
vignettes-based
study
of
170
general
practitioners (GPs) in Germany, 1 in 5 stated that they would
not assess suicide risk among elderly patients with depression
because they feared that asking such questions could ‘induce’
suicidal thoughts and behaviour.11 A more recent survey of GPs
in England revealed that a quarter believed that screening for
suicidal ideation could induce a person to have thoughts of self-
harm.12 General practitioners that took part in this study stated
that young people and those with personality disorder may be
especially susceptible to the effects of being asked such questions.
Support
for
the
notion that
suicidal ideation can be
‘transmitted’ by exposure to this subject comes from observational
studies showing clustering of suicidal behaviour on in-patient
mental health units13 and short-term increase in the incidence
of suicidal behaviour following media coverage of incidents of
suicide.14–16
It has been argued that before screening for health-related
problems is introduced, the potential harms as well as potential
benefits need to be examined.17 The impact of screening for
suicidal ideation among people with signs of depression in
primary care has not been examined. An official inquiry into
methods for preventing suicide in the USA concluded that, for this
reason, screening for suicide risk in primary care could not be
supported.18 In the light of the uncertainty about the impact of
screening for suicidal ideation in primary care, we set out to
conduct a clinical trial among people who have signs of depression
and are treated in this setting. Our primary aim was to find out
whether being screened for suicidal ideation had a short-term
impact on the extent to which patients subsequently felt that their
life was not worth living.
Method
We
conducted
a
randomised
trial
(trial
registration:
ISRCTN84692657) among people attending primary care services
in north and west London. We recruited study participants from
four practices where we had established links with local clinicians.
The practices are all in inner-city areas that have a relatively young
and ethnically diverse population.19 The practices each serve
between 7000 and 9000 local residents. Recruitment took place
over a 22-month period (March 2007 to December 2008).
Study procedures
People registered with these practices who were aged over 18 were
screened for depression using a two-item screening questionnaire
(‘During the past month, have you often been bothered by feeling
down, depressed or hopeless?’ and ‘During the past month, have
you often been bothered by little interest or pleasure in doing
things?’).20
Those who responded ‘yes’ to either or both items were given
written and verbal information about the study and asked to
provide consent to take part. In most instances a researcher
(P.B. or L.T.) asked the screening questions prior to the clinical

Background
Concerns have been expressed about the impact that
screening for risk of suicide may have on a person’s mental
health.
Aims
To examine whether screening for suicidal ideation among
people who attend primary care services and have signs of
depression increases the short-term incidence of feeling that
life is not worth living.
Method
In a multicentre, single-blind, randomised controlled trial, 443
patients in four general practices were randomised to
screening for suicidal ideation or control questions on health
and lifestyle (trial registration: ISRCTN84692657). The primary
outcome was thinking that life is not worth living measured
10–14 days after randomisation. Secondary outcome
measures comprised other aspects of suicidal ideation and
behaviour.
Results
A total of 443 participants were randomised to early (n = 230)
or delayed screening (n = 213). Their mean age was 48.5
years (s.d. = 18.4, range 16–92) and 137 (30.9%) were male.
The adjusted odds of experiencing thoughts that life was not
worth living at follow-up among those randomised to early
compared with delayed screening was 0.88 (95% CI 0.66–
1.18). Differences in secondary outcomes between the two
groups were not seen. Among those randomised to early
screening, 37 people (22.3%) reported thinking about taking
their life at baseline and 24 (14.6%) that they had this
thought 2 weeks later.
Conclusions
Screening for suicidal ideation in primary care among people
who have signs of depression does not appear to induce
feelings that life is not worth living.

 consultation. In a minority of instances, clinical staff working in
the practice used the screening questions during the clinical
consultation or as part of routine health checks.
Potential participants were told that we were conducting a
clinical trial that aimed to find out how people respond to being
screened for ‘health and emotional problems’ – no mention was
made of depression, suicidal thoughts or behaviour. Those who
agreed to take part in the study and had sufficient command of
English to complete the baseline interview were randomised to
screening for suicidal ideation or questions on health and lifestyle.
We used simple randomisation based on a central computer-
generated list. All study participants were interviewed on the
telephone on two occasions separated by between 10 and 14 days.
During the first of these interviews, which was usually conducted
by the researcher that recruited the participant (P.B. or L.T.), we
repeated the two-item screening questionnaire for depression,
collected basic demographic data and assessed participants’ mental
health using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ).21
A score of three or more on this questionnaire is taken to indicate
caseness.22 In addition, participants were asked six further
questions on either suicidal ideation and behaviour or health
and lifestyle depending on their allocation status.
Questions on suicidal ideation and behaviour were based on
those widely used in previous studies examining public mental
health23–25 which have been recommended as helpful for assessing
suicide risk.26 They were: ‘In the last 2 weeks: Have you felt that
life was not worth living? Have you wished that you were dead
– for instance, that you would go to sleep and not wake up? Have
you thought of taking your life even if you would not really do it?
Have you seriously considered taking your life? Have you
attempted to take your life?’ We also asked participants about
exposure to suicidal behaviour among people close to them as this
has been highlighted as an important factor to consider when
assessing for risk of suicide.26 We asked participants: ‘Has any
member of your family or someone else you are close to attempted
to harm themselves or commit suicide in the past?’ Control
questions on diet and lifestyle were taken from the Preventive
Nutrition Project.27
All follow-up interviews were conducted by a different
researcher who was masked to the participant’s allocation status.
On this occasion all participants were asked the six questions on
suicidal ideation and behaviour. In response to concerns expressed
by some healthcare professionals that people with personality
disorder may be susceptible to negative effects of screening for
suicidal ideation,12 we used an eight-item screening tool to
assess personality (the Standardised Assessment of Personality –
Abbreviated Scale, SAPAS).28 We used a cut-off point of three
or more on the SAPAS to indicate ‘probable personality disorder’
.
Finally, we asked four questions on social support taken from the
Close Persons’ Questionnaire.29
When participants described thoughts that life was not worth
living the researcher made further assessment of suicide risk,
encouraged the person to make use of resources already available
to them (such as discussing their feelings with healthcare staff),
and provided information about helplines and other sources of
help. In rare instances where participants reported suicidal plans,
the researcher asked for verbal consent to contact clinical staff on
their behalf. Brent Medical Ethics Committee approved the study
prior to the start of data collection (06/Q048/73).
Sample size
Data from a previous population-based study of mental health in
England suggests that 31% of people who have evidence of
depression have thought that life was not worth living during
the previous week.25 In order to have 80% power and 5% level
of significance to detect an increase in the proportion who felt
their life was not worth living from 30 to 45%, we needed to
recruit a sample of 326 individuals. To take account of the
clustered nature of the study sample and in anticipation of 15%
loss to follow-up we increased the sample size to 429 participants.
Data analysis
All analyses were based on the intention-to-treat principle using a
complete case analysis. Simple descriptive statistics were used to
examine differences in the characteristics of those randomised to
screening for suicidal ideation or questions on health and lifestyle.
Differences in primary and secondary outcomes were examined by
calculating odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95%
CI). To identify factors associated with feeling life was not worth
living during the follow-up interview, we used hierarchical logistic
regression. All potential confounders (both demographic variables
such as age and gender and clinical factors such as mental
health) and interaction terms were included in the first step.
The non-significant terms were eliminated one by one until the
final model was obtained. The statistical methodology used in
the analysis took account of the hierarchical structure of the data:
people nested within general practices. This was an important
consideration since we expected people from the same service to
have more in common than people from other services. This
analysis was carried out by gllamm, a programme written in
STATA for Windows, version 10.
Results
The trial profile is shown in Fig. 1. In total, 443 people were
recruited. Their mean age was 48.5 years (s.d.= 18.4, range 16–
92), 137 (30.9%) were male and 191 (43.1%) participants were
married or in long-term relationships. Of the 421 that provided
information about employment status, 201 (47.7%) were working
or in training, 134 (31.87%) were unemployed and 86 (20.4%)
were retired. All participants scored at least one out of two on
the two depression screening questions, with 255 (57.6%) scoring
positively on both. Mean score on the GHQ was 5.5 (s.d.= 3.6),
with 278 (62.8%) meeting threshold for psychiatric caseness.
Overall, 213 participants were randomised to screening for
suicidal ideation and 230 to control questions. There were no
deviations from random allocation, and data on one person (aged
16) who was erroneously randomised were included in the
analysis. Baseline characteristics of those randomised to each
arm of the trial are presented in Table 1.
Follow-up data were obtained on the primary outcome
measure for 351 (79.2%) participants. Characteristics of those
who were and were not followed up at 2 weeks are presented in
Table 2. Demographic characterises and mental health of those
who were and were not followed up appear to be similar.
At the 2-week follow-up interview, 46 (28.0%) of those
randomised to screening for suicidal ideation and 45 (24.1%) of
those randomised to control questions reported feeling that their
life was not worth living (OR = 1.23, 95% CI 0.76–1.98). Of those
randomised to questions on suicidal ideation, 38 (23.2%)
reported wishing they were dead compared with 43 (22.9%) of
those
randomised
to
questions
on
health
and
lifestyle
(OR = 1.01, 95% CI 0.61–1.66). Of those screened for suicidal
ideation, 24 (14.7%) reported having thought of taking their life
compared with 21 (11.3%) asked questions on health and lifestyle
(OR = 1.36, 95% CI 0.72–2.54). One person who was randomised
to control questions reported having attempted to take their life at
follow-up; no one among those randomised to screening for
suicidal ideation reported having done so.

 Screening for risk of suicide
Among those who were randomised to baseline screening for
suicidal ideation and followed up, 37 (22.5%) of 164 people
reported thinking about taking their life during the previous
2 weeks. Of 164 participants, 24 (14.6%) reported thinking about
taking their life 2 weeks later, and 5 (3.9%) of 129 people who
denied thinking about ending their life at baseline reported
thinking so during the 2 weeks after screening. In contrast, 17
(45.9%) of the 37 people who had thought about ending their life
at baseline denied having this thought at follow-up.

 Crawford et al
among those screened for suicidal ideation compared with those
asked questions on health and lifestyle was 0.88 (95% CI 0.66–
1.18). In this model, the thought that life was not worth living
at follow-up varied between the four general practices and was
strongly associated with baseline mental health and the presence
of
probable personality disorder. Associations
between
the
primary outcome with age and level of social support were not
found. An interaction between being randomised to screening
for suicidal ideation and employment status was found, suggesting
that among those who were screened at baseline, suicidal ideation
at follow-up was less likely among those who were retired
compared with those who were unemployed. Interactions between
personality status and age and the impact of being screened for
suicidal ideation during the baseline interview were not found.
Discussion
Our findings confirm that many people who have signs of
depression and are treated in primary care experience suicidal
ideation. More than 1 in 8 people who took part in the study
reported that they had thought of taking their life during the
previous 2 weeks, although fewer than 1 in 20 reported having
given serious consideration to ending their life. We found no
evidence to support the view that screening for suicidal ideation
among people in primary care leads to an increase in feelings that
life is not worth living.
Strengths and limitations
The main strengths of the study were that it was randomised and
that researchers collecting follow-up data were masked to
allocation status. By focusing on people who had signs of
depression, we included those patients for whom screening for
suicidal ideation has been recommended.6 We focused our
collection of follow-up data on the first 2 weeks after screening
because data from observational studies suggest that if increases
in suicidal ideation were to be found it would be within this
period.14
There are four main limitations associated with the study
design. First, although we achieved the study sample we aimed
to recruit and this was sufficient to detect clinically important
differences in thoughts that life was not worth living, the power
of the study was insufficient to explore differences in subgroups
of patients, or to detect differences in other aspects of suicidal
ideation or behaviour. With an incidence of 3 per 1000 in the
2-week period that we studied, we would have needed to have
randomised over a million people to have had sufficient power
to examine differences in the incidence of self-harm during this
period. However, feelings that life is not worth living provide a
sensitive (if not specific) indication of those at increased risk of
suicidal behaviour24 and we believe that this outcome provided
a sensitive measure of the potential impact of screening on the
emotional health of study participants.
Second, we could not collect baseline data on levels of suicidal
ideation or behaviour among those randomised to questions on
health and lifestyle, as to do so would have undermined the central
aim of the study. As a result, we do not know whether levels of
suicidal ideation differed between study groups at baseline.
However, we were able to assess general mental health, a factor
which was strongly associated with suicidal ideation, and we
believe that the adjusted odds ratios we have presented therefore
provide a more accurate estimate of the true relationship between
screening and future suicidal ideation.
Third, study participants were all recruited from relatively
deprived inner-city practices. Almost 40% of adults of working
age that took part in the study were unemployed. Although we
have no reason to believe that screening for suicidal ideation
would be associated with different outcomes among people living
in less deprived areas, we cannot be certain of this.
Finally, the method we used to screen for suicidal ideation in
the study differed from the approach that would normally be
taken in clinical practice. Interviews with participants were
conducted on the telephone after their visit to the GP rather than
face to face as part of a clinical consultation. Although the external
validity of the study would have been greater if participants had
been asked about suicidal thoughts during the session with the
doctor, GPs told us that it would be impractical for them to
randomise patients during the clinical consultation.
Clinical implications
This is the first time that the impact of screening for suicidal
ideation
has
been
examined
experimentally
among
adults.
However, a previous attempt was made to examine the impact
of screening school-aged children for risk of suicide using a self-
completed questionnaire.30 Two days after completing the survey,
the mental health of those that had been asked questions about
suicidal thoughts was no worse than that of children who had
not been asked these questions. As with our study, confidence
limits around the odds ratio for suicidal ideation were broad
(OR = 1.2, 95% CI 0.72–2.00), but sufficient for the authors to
conclude that screening did not increase the likelihood of such
thoughts.30
Although our findings have implications primarily for those
working in primary care settings, we believe that in the absence
of evidence on the impact of screening for suicidal ideation in
general hospital settings, these data have wider implications.

 Screening for risk of suicide
Researchers investigating the epidemiology of suicidal behaviour
face a variety of ethical challenges,31 and concerns about the
impact of assessing suicidal ideation in research projects have been
raised in the past.32 Ethics committees have expressed concerns
about the impact of research participants being asked such
questions, and these findings may help reassure those reviewing
proposals for new studies that asking questions about risk of
suicide does not appear to have a short-term detrimental effect
on people’s mental health.
Among those who were randomised to screening for suicidal
ideation, we found that very few people who did not have
thoughts of ending their life at baseline reported having these
thoughts at follow-up. In contrast almost half of those who
reported thinking of ending their life at baseline denied having
this thought during the following 2 weeks. These findings support
those of a population-based study by Gunnell and colleagues who
found that most people who experience thoughts of ending their
life no longer do so 18 months later.33 They also provide support
for the view that ‘watchful waiting’ of those with suicidal ideation
is appropriate in primary care, in the absence of firmer evidence of
risk of suicide such as a suicide plan.6
Although these data provide evidence that screening for
suicidal ideation does not have an impact on the likelihood of
subsequent suicidal ideation, they do not provide information
about how patients feel about being asked such questions. For
some healthcare practitioners and patients the topic of suicide
remains a sensitive one10,12 and such enquiry needs to be handled
in a sensitive manner. Our data suggest that when these questions
are asked in such a manner they do not appear to increase the
likelihood of people starting to think their life may not be worth
living.
This study did not examined whether screening for suicidal
ideation in primary care leads to improved patient outcomes.
Previous research examining the impact of a primary care-based
intervention following self-harm found no evidence of patient
benefit.34 Further research is required to examine the process
and outcomes of screening for suicide risk in primary care to
establish the impact of current guidelines which advocate this
practice.
In summary, screening for risk of suicide does not appear to
increase the likelihood of a person having thoughts that life is
not worth living. Primary care workers should have the confidence
to screen for suicide risk among people with signs of depression.

King David: an episode of acute stress disorder during the brief life
and premature death of Bathsheba’s baby
George Stein
The second book of Samuel tells the story of how King David took a fancy to Bathsheba who was at the time the wife of another
man. When their first child was born, David became abruptly mute, refused to eat or drink and appeared to be considering sui-
cide for a brief period. However, as soon as the child had died he recovered quickly, a picture suggestive of an ICD–10 acute
stress disorder.
2 Sam. 11:2 ‘It happened, late one afternoon, when David rose from his couch, and was walking about on the roof of the King’s
house that he saw a woman bathing; the woman was very beautiful. 3 David sent someone to inquire about the woman. It was
reported ‘This is Bathsheba daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite’. 4 So David sent messages to fetch her and she came
to him and he lay with her. (Now she was purifying herself after her period.) Then she returned to her house. 5 The woman
conceived and she sent and told David ‘‘I am pregnant.’’ ’
The story goes on describe how David gets rid of Uriah, by arranging for him to be sent to the front in the war against the Ara-
maeans where the fighting was most intense and where a certain death in battle awaited him:
11:26 ‘When the wife of Uriah heard that her husband was dead, she made lamentation for him. 27 When the mourning was
over David sent and brought her to his house and she became his wife and bore him a son. But the thing that David had done
displeased the Lord and the Lord sent Nathan to David’.
The prophet Nathan admonished David for the crime of stealing Uriah’s wife and then arranging for him to be killed and told him
that he would be punished for it as ‘the child that is born to you, shall die’.
12.15 ‘The Lord struck the child that Uriah’s wife bore to David, and it became very ill. 16 David pleaded with God for the child;
David fasted and went in and lay all night on the ground. The elders of his house stood besides him, urging him to rise from the
ground: but he would not nor did he eat food with them. On the seventh day the child died. And the servants of David were
afraid to tell him that the child was dead: for they said while the child was alive we spoke to him, and he did not listen to
us; how then can we tell him the child is dead? He may do himself some harm.’
When David hears that the child is dead he recovers rapidly and once more talks to his servants, then anoints himself and starts
to eat again.
ICD–10 describes acute stress reaction (F43.0) as ‘a transient disorder of significant severity which develops in an individual in
response to exceptional physical and/or mental stress and which usually subsides within hours or days. The symptoms typically
include an initial state of daze . . . followed by further withdrawal from the surrounding situation (to the extent of a dissociative
stupor) or by agitation or overactivity. Symptoms usually appear within minutes of the impact of the stressful stimulus and dis-
appear within 2–3 days’. Following the birth of his baby David is acutely distressed, becomes dazed as he is mute; he fails to
respond to his servants, nor does he eat or drink, and the servants think he may harm himself. However, the condition resolves
very rapidly once the baby dies, with the whole episode lasting for less than 7 days.
The moral tutorial that the prophet Nathan gives to David that not even a king should lust after another man’s wife has been
often recounted by priests and rabbis over the ages, but the equally useful psychiatric tutorial on ICD–10 acute stress reaction
as described in this ancient text is rarely, if ever, cited.
