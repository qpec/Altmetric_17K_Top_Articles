A flexitarian or semi-vegetarian diet (SVD) is one that is primarily vegetarian with the 
occasional inclusion of meat or fish. Of late, there appears to be an increasing move-
ment toward this practice. There has not been a recent update on these diets from a 
health perspective. Using the National Centre for Biotechnology Information PubMed 
database, a search was made for all studies published between 2000 and 2016 that met 
defined inclusion criteria. A total of 25 studies were located with 12 focusing on body 
weight and diet quality. There was emerging evidence suggestive of benefits for body 
weight, improved markers of metabolic health, blood pressure, and reduced risk of type 
2 diabetes. SVD may also have a role to play in the treatment of inflammatory bowel 
diseases, such as Crohn’s disease. Given that there is a higher tendency for females to 
be flexitarian yet males are more likely to overconsume meat, there is a clear need to 
communicate the potential health benefits of these diets to males.
Keywords: flexitarian, semi-vegetarian diet, public health, gender differences, dietary trends
iNTRODUCTiON
“Flextarianism” is a neoteric term that has been emerging in the scientific and public sectors 
recently. Added to the Oxford English Dictionary in 2014, flexitarian is a portmanteau of “flexible” 
and “vegetarian,” referring to an individual who follows a primarily but not strictly vegetarian diet, 
occasionally eating meat or fish (1). Despite the global demands for meat, it appears that there are 
now a growing number of flexitarian consumers who abstain from eating meat regularly (2).
Most consumers can be grouped into meat consumers, meat avoiders, or meat reducers (3). The 
trend toward flexitarian diets (FDs) appears to reflect consumers who are “meat-reducers,” eating 
meat within meals on some but not every day of the week (3), as with typical “meat-eaters”
. This 
definition is most closely in line with that of semi- or demi-vegetarianism. Subsequently, the terms 
are often used inter-changeably in the literature. For example, in one publication semi-vegetarian 
diets (SVDs) are defined as those significantly reducing meat intake on at least 3 days of the week (4).
The FD seems to recognize the fact that meat is an important source of protein, fat, and micronu-
trients (5, 6), yet also considers the ethical sides, such as the need to avoid intensification and improve 
animal welfare (7). It also considers evidence that long-term consumption of increasing amounts of 
red meat and particularly processed meat may increase the risk of mortality, cardiovascular disease, 
type 2 diabetes, and certain forms of cancer such as colon cancer (6). Recently, the International 
Agency for Research on Cancer classified red meat as probably carcinogenic and processed meat 
carcinogenic to humans (8).
Research from NatCen’s British Social Attitudes survey found that 29% of people in Britain have 
reduced the amount of meat that they ate in the past 12 months (9). The definition of meat reducers 
included reductions in all meats except fish. In particular, women (34%) were most likely to reduce 
their meat intake. Similarly, 39% of 65- to 79-year olds had reduced their red meat intake compared

with 19% of 18- to 24-year olds. The report also showed that men 
(23%) were shifting and reducing their meat intake. Over half 
(58%) cited health reasons along with saving money, concerns 
over animal welfare, and food safety (9).
The aim of the present paper was to review the evidence 
looking at the FD/SVDs and health, using defined inclusion 
criteria. While some discussion papers have been published 
about vegetarianism (10) and low-meat diets and health (11), no 
publications have focused on the current trend of flexitarianism 
or SVDs. The present paper set out to evaluate the evidence-based 
looking as FD/SVDs from a public health perspective.
MeTHODS
The National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) 
search engine (PubMed) was used to extract relevant English-
language papers published between January 2000 and June 2016. 
Data files were extracted from the NCBI collection depository 
and imported into Covidence software used to create systematic 
reviews.
As flexitarian is a relatively new term, the search terms “flexi-
tarian,” “semi-vegetarian,” and “demi-vegetarian” were combined 
with “blood pressure,” “body weight,” “cancer,” “diabetes,” “diet 
quality,” “health,” “heart disease,” “metabolic health,” and “nutri-
ent intake/status” to filter publications. Data extracted from each 
article included (1) country of research, (2) subjects (number of 
participants, gender, age), (3) design and methods, (4) definitions 
used, and (5) study outcomes/findings.
For inclusion, studies needed to clearly define the terms flexi-
tarian, semi-vegetarian, or demi-vegetarian used in their study. 
Data results and findings also needed to be reported and analyzed 
separately from other forms of dietary patterns. Randomized 
controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies were included. 
Articles were excluded if they were published before 2000, a pilot 
study, or focused solely on vegan diets or vegetarianism.
ReSULTS
The NCBI search identified 46 papers and after an adjustment for 
replica papers, 39 articles remained for assessment. Of these, 14 
papers were discarded after reviewing the abstracts and article 
content as they did not meet the inclusion criteria. This left 25 
articles for general review. This included 21 epidemiological stud-
ies and 4 randomized controlled or clinical trials. The algorithm 
of qualifying publications is shown in Figure 1. Of these, 12 
studies were conducted in the US or Canada, 6 in Europe, 5 in 
Asia, and 2 in Australasia.
Definitions
Definitions of flexi-semi-vegetarianism were extracted from the 
identified papers (Table 1). Definitions tended to vary between 
studies. For example, some authors specified that participants on 
an SVD restricted their intake of red meat (12, 13), while oth-
ers restricted fish (14). In studies using data from the Adventist 
Health Study-2, SVDs were defined as those consuming dairy 
products and/or eggs and meat (red meat and poultry ≥1 time/
month and <1 time/week) (15–20).
In a more general sense, other authors defined SVDs as those 
containing moderate levels of animal products (21, 22), though it 
was not specified what “moderate” was. One paper defined these 
as eating red meat, poultry, or fish no more than once a week 
(23), while other studies reported participants as being semi-
vegetarian (SV) if they excluded red meat from their diet but ate 
other meats (13).
HeALTH
Body weight
As shown in Table 2, six studies focused on SVDs and body 
weight. Two RCTs looked at the effects of different plant-based 
diets in relation to weight loss. In one study, authors undertook 
a 6-month RCT, where overweight adults were allocated to five 
different plant-based diets. Vegan diets were associated with sig-
nificantly higher levels of weight loss by the end of the study (22). 
A Korean study reported that postmenopausal women maintain-
ing an SVD over 20 years had a significantly lower body weight, 
body mass index (BMI), and percentage of body fat compared 
with non-vegetarians (NVs) (12).
Cross-sectional data from 71,751 participants taking part in 
the Adventist Health Study-2 (2002–2007) showed that BMI was 
highest in NVs (mean 28.7 kg/m2), slightly lower in SVs (mean 
27.4 kg/m2), and lowest in strict vegetarians (mean 24.0 kg/m2) 
(18). These findings are similar to earlier trends (2002–2006 
analysis) showing that mean BMI was lowest in vegans (23.6 kg/
m2) and incrementally higher in lacto-ovo vegetarians (LOVs) 
(25.7 kg/m2), pesco-vegetarians (PVs) (26.3 kg/m2), SVs (27.3 kg/
m2), and NVs (28.8 kg/m2) (15). Cross-sectional research on 
9,113 young Australian women (22–27 years) identified that SVs 
had a lower BMI and tended to exercise more than NVs (13).

Cancer
Four studies were found to fulfill the inclusion criteria. One study 
examined vegetarian patterns in relation to breast cancer (BC) 
risk using data from 96,001 adults taking part in the prospec-
tive Adventist Health Study-2 (2002–2007). Findings showed 
that vegans had a significantly lower risk of BC compared with 
vegetarian and NVs (24).
With regard to prostate cancer risk, data from 26,346 males 
taking part in the Adventist Health Study-2 found that only 
vegan diets were associated with reduced prostate cancer risk 
(25). Equally, an earlier analysis of this study showed that 
vegan diets had statistically significant protection for overall 
cancer incidence (hazard ratio = 0.84; 95% confidence interval: 
0.72, 0.99) (26). Other work using data from the same North 
American study discovered that PVs had the lowest risk of 
colorectal cancer, followed by LOVs, vegans, and SVs when 
compared with NVs (20).
Diabetes and Metabolic Syndrome
Six studies were found looking at SVDs in relation to markers 
of metabolic health or risk of diabetes. In one study, authors 
observed that postmenopausal women following an SVD for 
more than 20 years had significantly lower glucose, insulin 
levels, and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance 
compared with NV controls (12).
Other research using data from India’s third National Family 
Health Survey 2005–2006 (n = 156,317) from adults aged 
20–49 years found that the consumption of lacto-, lacto-ovo-, 
and SVDs were associated with a reduced likelihood of diabetes 
compared with NV diets, after data adjustments (14). Equally, 
research from the Adventist Health Study-2 found that cases of 
diabetes developed were lowest in vegans (0.54%), followed by 
SVs (0.92%), LOVs (1.1%), and PVs (1.3%) compared with 2.1% 
in NVs (16).
Furthermore, cross-sectional data from the Adventist Health 
Study-2 (n = 773) showed that the prevalence of metabolic syn-
drome was highest in NVs (39.7%), intermediate in SVs (37.6%), 
and lowest in vegetarians (25.2%). Data for vegans were not 
reported (17). Findings from the same study also highlighted that 
diabetes prevalence was 2.9% in vegans, 4.8% in SVs, and 7.6% 
in NVs (15). With regard to blood pressure, research involving 
26 postmenopausal women from convents found that omnivores 
had significantly higher systolic and diastolic pressures than the 
SVs (27).
Diet Quality
Six studies focused on dietary quality, nutritional intakes, and/or 
status. In a randomized trial, overweight and obese adults were 
allocated to different plant-based diets. Participants allocated 
to the vegan and vegetarian diets had significantly improved

macronutrient profiles and Diet Inflammatory Index (DII) scores 
(a tool for assessing the inflammatory potential of a diet). Vegan, 
vegetarian, and PV groups all had significant improvement in the 
DII score at 2 months but not at 6 months (22).
Remaining studies were mainly observational in nature. For 
example, an internet-based survey using data collection tools 
from the Belgian Food Consumption Survey and a convenience 
sample of subjects showed that vegan diets had the lowest total 
energy and highest fiber intake compared with omnivores (23). 
Alongside this, results from 96,335 adults in the Adventist Health 
Study-2 showed found that those eating SVDs had the lowest 
caloric intakes (1,713 kcal/day) but other than this there were 
few dietary differences (18).
Cross-sectional research from the Australian Longitudinal 
Study on Women’s Health (n = 9,113) showed that rates of low 
iron, iron-deficiency, or anemia were highest in vegetarians 
(42.6%), followed by SVs (38.6%) and then NVs (25.5%) (13). 
Other research focusing on the omega-3 profile of diets showed 
that vegan and vegetarian diets led to reductions in eicosapen-
taenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid levels compared with 
semi-omnivores (28).
Additional Health Outcomes
Three studies focused on other health outcomes. One study 
observed that SVDs helped to prevent relapse of symptoms in 
patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (29). Additional 
research by the same team concluded that up to 32.4 g dietary 
fiber, delivered via an SVD could be given to patients with IBD, 
indicating that these could be used as a supportive treatment for 
Crohn’s disease patients (30).
Other work involving 73,308 adults from the Seventh-day 
Adventist study-2 demonstrated that vegetarian diets, including

SVDs were associated with lower all-cause mortality, with results 
appearing to be more robust in males (19).
DiSCUSSiON
Flexitarian diets have been gaining popularity—a transition 
that seems to have been fueled by a combination of health, 
environmental, and animal welfare concerns. The present paper 
has identified that flexitarian/SVDs could have potential health 
benefits with strongest evidence appearing to be in relation to 
weight loss and metabolic health benefits, including reduced 
diabetes risk and blood pressure (Table 2).
There is also emerging evidence that SVDs could be an option 
for patients with IBD, such as Crohn’s disease (30). While the 
mechanisms behind this are yet to be confirmed, it has been 
speculated that a plant-based diet may be effective for gut inflam-
mation, namely, through the actions of dietary fiber (31).
Physicians focused on non-invasive and cost-effective inter-
ventions could help their patients improve health outcomes by 
encouraging a shift toward diets higher in vegetables, whole 
grains, legumes and fruits, and fewer animal products (32) with 
an FD being a useful tool in this transition. Furthermore, it has 
been estimated that making a transition toward plant-based diets 
that are aligned with standard dietary guidelines could help to 
reduce global mortality by 6–10% (33).
Flexitarian diets/semi-vegetarian diets could also be useful in 
helping those with high meat intakes to fall in line with recom-
mended guidelines. For example, data from the UK National Diet 
and Nutrition Survey showed that red and processed meat intakes 
were 84 g/day for men and 47 g/day for women (34). Scientific 
Advisory Committee on Nutrition guidelines are set at 70 g/day 
for adults for red and processed meat (35). Subsequently, there is 
a greater tendency for males to exceed red and processed meat 
guidelines. Interestingly, looking at the studies reviewed, around 
70% of conscious flexitarians were educated females (15, 18, 20, 
26). Considering this, there is clear scope to educate males about 
the health benefits of FDs.
In order to align with meat intake guidelines other approaches 
can also be taken. These include a greater use of simulated meat-
like products with a similar flavor, texture, and color to meat (36). 
As it is the International Year of the Pulse, there has been much 
interest in these from a health perspective. Pulses include beans, 
peas, and lentils, which have been eaten for at least 10,000 years, 
providing protein, fiber, and essential micronutrients, including 
iron, folate zinc, magnesium, as well as phytochemicals, such as 
saponins and tannins (37). It has been estimated that eating just 
half a cup of beans or peas daily can significantly enhance diet 
quality and nutrient density, helping consumers to meet dietary 
recommendations (37).
Limitations
On the whole, FDs appear to have emerging health benefits. 
However, it should be considered that before any formal rec-
ommendations about FDs can be made, official definitions 
of these diets are needed. For example, the inclusion criteria 
used in the present article did not always bring up publica-
tions using the same definition of SVDs. In Germany, legal 
definitions of vegetarian and vegan have been compiled by the 
German Federation of Food Law and Food Science and the 
Vegetarierbund Deutschland to facilitate the categorizing and 
labeling of foods, though these definitions are yet to be for-
malized by the European Commission (38). Similarly, a formal 
classification of FDs is needed that can be put into appropriate 
use in future research.
Presently, large cohort investigations also appear to over-
look FD/SVDs. For example, the recent European Prospective 
Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition did not include SVDs 
when comparing the metabolic profile of meat eaters, vegetar-
ians, and vegans (39). It is also worth pointing out that large 
dietary surveys, such as the UK National Diet and Nutrition 
Survey, could look to include a definition and analysis of flexitar-
ian or SVDs.
Equally, impending RCTs looking to investigate the health 
benefits of FD/SVDs need to align methodologies with the 
Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials guidelines for RCTs 
(40). In the case of observational studies, these should follow 
the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational studies in 
Epidemiology guidelines (41). It was a limitation in the present 
review that the most research came from the US and Canadian 
Adventist Health Study. The SV dietary approaches taken by these 
Adventists may be different that of other flexitarians or SVs. More 
research in the UK and Europe is needed to examine this.
One a final note, in the present review, the focus was on 
“flexitarianism” as this terminology has been increasingly used 
by the public press. Nevertheless, it should be considered that 
terms such as “meat reduction” or “Mediterranean diets” which 
may also constitute an FD were not included in this review. 
These could form the basis of future publications, along with an 
anticipated future growth in studies looking at FD and markers 
of health.
CONCLUSiON
The trend of flexitarianism does not appear to be subsiding. This 
review provides a first line of evidence that FDs may have emerg-
ing health benefits in relation to weight loss, metabolic health, and 
diabetes prevention. While most flexitarians presently seem to be 
female, there is a clear need to communicate the potential health 
benefits of these diets to males. As not everyone and in particular 
men might not want to exclude meat altogether, FDs offer a path 
that includes their dietary preferences yet could improve public 
health outcomes.
