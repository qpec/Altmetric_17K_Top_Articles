illes de la Tourette syndrome (TS) is a disorder 
characterized by involuntary motor and phonic 
tics, which typically begin in early childhood. 
While most cases can be managed medically or attenu-
ate in adulthood, a subset of patients has extremely severe 
and refractory symptoms that result in significant injury 
and social isolation.7,41 For some of these patients who 
have not responded to a number of pharmacological and 
cognitive interventions, deep brain stimulation (DBS) has 
been repeatedly demonstrated to be safe and effective. An 
increasing number of reports have shown that DBS can 
dramatically reduce the number of tics in medically re-
fractory TS.1–3,8–12,16,18,20,21,23,25,29,35,42 However, debate re-
mains concerning many aspects of the procedure. While 
recent recommendations for inclusion and exclusion cri-
teria have been put forth,35 the ideal target(s) remain a 
matter of debate,28 with 9 different regions postulated to 
provide potential benefit via interruption of a putative TS 
circuit.13,17,22,31 The majority of case reports focus mainly 
on the subregions of the centromedian thalamus or glo-
bus pallidus internus (GPI).20,33,40 Our center selected the 
medial thalamic target (centromedian-parafascicular nu-
cleus/ventralis oralis internus/substantia periventricularis), 
based on the preponderance of positive case reports sup-
porting its efficacy.1,2,32,34,37,38 We report here our surgical

OBJECTIVE Tourette syndrome (TS) is a complex neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by multiple motor and pho-
nic tics. While pharmacological and behavioral therapy can be effective in most patients, a subset of patients remains 
refractory to treatment. Increasing clinical evidence from multiple centers suggests that deep brain stimulation (DBS) of 
the medial thalamus can be effective in many cases of refractory TS.
METHODS The authors retrospectively reviewed outcomes in 13 patients with refractory TS who underwent medial 
thalamic DBS performed by their team over a 7-year period. Patients were evaluated by a multidisciplinary team, and 
preoperative objective assessments were performed using the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS) and Yale-Brown 
Obsessive Compulsive Scale. YGTSS scores were calculated at visits immediately postoperatively and at the most re-
cent follow-up in patients with a minimum of 6 months of postoperative follow-up. Coordinates of the active DBS contacts 
were calculated and projected onto each patient’s pre- and postoperative images.
RESULTS Patients showed an average decrease of 37% (p = 0.0063) in the total tic severity at their first postoperative 
visit. At their latest visit, their scores achieved significance, decreasing from preoperative scores by an average of 50% 
(p = 0.0014). The average position of the active contact was noted to be at the junction of the posterior ventralis oralis in-
ternus/centromedian-parafascicular nuclei. Device-related complications occurred in 2 patients, necessitating additional 
surgeries. All patients continued to use the system at last follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS The authors’ data are consistent with the small but growing body of literature supporting DBS of the 
ventralis oralis internus/centromedian-parafascicular thalamus as an effective and relatively safe treatment for severe, 
refractory TS.

years. We further explored the specific regions of stimu-
lation that appear to correlate with symptomatic improve-
ment.
Methods
We conducted a retrospective review of all patients with 
TS who underwent thalamic DBS performed by our team 
(Table 1). Of 15 patients who underwent surgery between 
January 2009 and May 2016, 13 consecutive patients with 
at least 6 months of follow-up were included. Before un-
dergoing surgery, all patients were screened by an expe-
rienced movement disorders neurologist and stereotactic 
neurosurgeon familiar with DBS and the management of 
TS. Patients were assessed using the Yale Global Tic Se-
verity Scale (YGTSS), the Yale-Brown Obsessive Com-
pulsive Scale (YBOCS), and formal neuropsychological 
evaluation.14,23 A complete assessment of treatment mo-
dalities was reviewed. Patients were required to have tried 
a course of cognitive behavioral therapy, 1 alpha adren-
ergic agonist, and at least 3 dopamine receptor–blocking 
medications with either adequate dosages or limiting side 
effects. Significant psychiatric comorbidities, including 
debilitating obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and/
or depression, were considered relative contraindications 
pending further psychiatric evaluation. A minimum age 
of 16 years in cases of self-injury or 18 years in the ab-
sence of self-injury was used. All cases were subsequently 
reviewed by a multidisciplinary committee comprising 2 
psychiatrists (1 pediatric psychiatrist in patients < 18 years 
old), a neuropsychologist, 2 neurosurgeons, and 2 move-
ment disorder neurologists familiar with the diagnosis and 
management of TS. All operations were performed by the 
same neurosurgeon (A.Y.M.), and the deep brain stimula-
tor was programmed by the same neurologist (M.P.); some 
patients underwent additional follow-up programming at 
outside medical centers. Institutional review board ap-
proval was obtained for the retrospective chart review as 
well as for subsequent administration of a brief question-
naire.
Surgical Technique
The DBS implantation was performed as a multistage 
procedure.4 A few weeks prior to surgery, stereotactic 
MRI was performed under general anesthesia in order to 
minimize head movement. Preliminary target and trajec-
tory planning was then performed using the Brainlab ste-
reotactic system (Brainlab AB). The indirect coordinates 
for the electrode tip were chosen at 5 mm lateral to the 
midline, 4 mm posterior, and 0 mm superior to the mid-
commissural plane,1 corresponding to the substantia peri-
ventricularis. Entry angles ranged from 45° to 65° in the 
sagittal plane and from 25° to 38° lateral in the coronal 
plane.
The MR images were fused the day of surgery with 
thin-cut (0.6 or 1 mm) CT-scan images obtained after 
placement of the stereotactic frame (Leksell, Elekta AB). 
Surgery was performed with the patient under conscious 
sedation (6 patients) or general anesthesia (7 patients). Mi-
croelectrode recordings were obtained intraoperatively, 
starting at 15 mm above the stereotactic target (Alpha-
Omega Engineering). Test stimulation, either macrostim-
ulation through the microelectrode sheath (3 mm above 
the tip) or direct stimulation through the DBS electrode, 
was performed to assess for side effects. In no cases did 
test stimulation lead to repositioning of the lead. All pa-
tients underwent bilateral implantation with DBS leads 
(model 3387, Medtronic). The pulse generators (bilateral 
single channel in 11 patients, dual channel in 2 patients) 
were placed under general anesthesia either the same day 
(2 patients), or within 14 days following lead placement. A 
high-resolution CT scan was obtained immediately post-
operatively in all patients. In addition, 2 patients under-
went postoperative high-resolution MRI. The postopera-
tive images were then fused with the preoperative data set 
to identify the actual stereotactic coordinates of the lead 
contacts.
Postoperative Care
Initial programming typically began approximately 2 
weeks after the DBS implantation at the first postoperative 
visit. Each electrode was evaluated using a pulse width of 
90 msec, a frequency of 130 Hz, and steadily increasing 
voltages up to 4 V or less, depending on tolerability. The 
initially selected active electrode was either the one as-
sociated with subjective improvement or, in the absence 
of immediate benefit (as was more commonly the case), 
the most ventral, best tolerated electrode. During follow-
up visits, the settings were adjusted according to perceived 
benefit or side effects, typically with increasing voltages 
followed by addition of adjacent electrodes or higher pulse 
width in patients who were not robustly responding. Pa-
tients usually received voltage in the range of 1–2 V, which 
they could adjust on their own between visits. The patients 
were closely monitored for side effects and serious ad-
verse events, usually monthly initially and then every 3–6 
months after the 3rd month depending on proximity and 
need. At each visit, the patient’s YGTSS score was usu-
ally calculated and, where appropriate, the YBOCS score 
was calculated as well. All patients also participated in 
2-question telephone surveys administered from 6 to 74 
months after the procedure. The first question was to rate 
their current symptoms on the Clinical Global Impression 
scale,15 and the second question was to answer the query, 
“Knowing what you know now, would you have the sur-
gery again?” The preoperative and postoperative YGTSS 
and YBOCS scores were compared and, along with the 
answers to the survey questions, served as measures of ef-
ficacy.
The preoperative scores were compared with postop-
erative scores using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Patients 
served as their own controls, with preoperative YGTSS 
scores being compared with those obtained at the initial 
and the most recent follow-up visits. A Pearson correla-
tion coefficient was calculated for the individual subscores 
compared with the overall improvement in YGTSS score. 
Preoperative YBOCS scores were compared only to the 
latest follow-up visit and were not performed in 1 patient 
who denied OCD symptoms. Given the sample size and 
the multiple tests involved, a p < 0.01 was considered sig-
nificant. All calculations were performed using the SPSS 
statistical software package (IBM).

Results
Patients had a mean follow-up time of 23 months (range 
6–58 months). The mean improvement in the YGTSS 
score was 50% compared with preoperative testing (p = 
0.0014). All patients demonstrated improvement in their 
symptoms due to DBS therapy, although degrees of im-
provement ranged from 16% to 100% based on change in 
YGTSS score (Fig. 1 upper). Improvement of greater than 
30% was seen in 84% of patients, and improvement great-
er than 50% was noted in 55% of patients. One patient, 
who had the the mildest tic severity at baseline, remained 
virtually tic free at the last follow-up, and 3 additional pa-
tients with more marked baseline severity reported mini-
mal tic activity at the last follow-up. No patient reported 
an increase in tic severity at the latest follow-up post-DBS, 
although intervisit tic severity varied considerably in some 
patients (Fig. 1 lower). The YGTSS data also showed a 
significant difference between the preoperative scores and 
the first follow-up visit (p = 0.0063). However, the differ-
ence between the first follow-up visit and the latest follow-
up visit was not statistically significant (p = 0.42). At their 
first follow-up visit, 54% of patients had a greater than 
30% reduction in score, and 46% had a greater than 50% 
reduction in score. While most patients continued to have 
tics, an overall 50% improvement in terms of subjective 
impairment, motor, and vocal subscores of the YGTSS 
was observed in all patients, demonstrating significant 
correlations with overall improvement. The strongest cor-
relation was with subjective impairment (R = 0.9044), fol-
lowed by motor tics (R = 0.8654) and then vocal tics (R = 
0.8575) (Fig. 2A–C).
The YBOCS scores were not calculated for all patients 
since some patients reported no or minimal OCD behav-
iors. However, when captured, the scores were compared 
preoperatively and postoperatively (n = 12). The difference 
between the scores was not significant between the preop-
erative and most recent postoperative YBOCS scores (p = 
0.033) at our alpha level of 0.01. Though individual results 
varied, 63% of patients had a greater than 50% reduction 
in their YBOCS scores, while 1 patient experienced an 
increase in OCD behaviors (Fig. 2D).
In response to the 2-question survey, 100% of patients 
reported that they would rate their symptoms as either 
much improved or very much improved on the Clinical 
Global Impression scale. In addition, 100% of patients re-
ported that knowing what they know about the procedure 
now, they would elect to have the surgery again.
Stimulation Parameters and Lead Locations
Stimulation parameters for each patient are listed in 
Table 2. The majority (9/13) of patients had programming 
in simple monopolar mode, while the others had program-
ming in bipolar mode (Cases 1, 5, and 11) or double mo-
nopolar mode (Case 9). The coordinates of the lead tips 
and active contacts, as determined by postoperative image 
fusion, are displayed in Table 3. The average active contact 
location localized to the junction of the posterior ventralis 
oralis internus (VOI)/anterior centromedian-parafascicu-
lar (CM-PF) complex (Fig. 3). There were no significant 
differences between the left and right side for either the 
lead tip or the active contact location. No significant corre-
lations were observed between active contact coordinates 
and the degree of symptomatic improvement among pa-
tients (1-way ANOVA).
Complications
There were no postoperative hemorrhages or any other 
immediate postoperative surgical complications. Two pa-
tients experienced device-related complications, necessitat-
ing additional surgical intervention (Table 2). One patient 
experienced wound erosion and infection (methicillin-sen-
sitive Staphylococcus aureus) at the connector site in the 
left parietal scalp 8 months postoperatively, necessitating 
removal of the left lead and generator, which was replaced 
5 months later without adverse sequelae. In another patient, 
excessive manual manipulation of the right pulse genera-

tor (“twiddler’s syndrome”) resulted in an extension lead 
fracture 10 months after system implantation as previously 
reported. The extension lead was replaced, but a postoper-
ative infection developed 3 weeks later (organism: Pseu-
domonas aeruginosa), and the entire right-sided system 
was removed. It was reimplanted 4 months later, but the 
same right-sided system needed to be removed when an 
aseptic cyst developed at the lead tip 13 months later, re-
sulting in headaches and mental status changes secondary 
to obstructive hydrocephalus.19 Upon removal of the entire

baseline condition, albeit with hemi-tics on the nonstimu-
lated side.30
Discussion
Our findings further support that the CM-PF region is a 
consistently if not uniformly effective target for the treat-
ment of TS. All patients demonstrated a response to the 
treatment with a reduction in symptoms, and on average 
they showed a significant 50% decrease in their YGTSS 
scores. These results are similar to other case series and 
observational studies, adding further support for the se-
lective use of DBS to treat TS.10,11,18,20,25,29,35 To our knowl-
edge, only the case series published by Servello et al.37 and 
Porta et al.29 involved a similar number of CM-PF DBS 
patients with long-term follow-up. These reports demon-
strated a 47% and 73% mean reduction in the YGTSS, 
respectively.
One striking feature of the response is the variable 
latency of effect. Half of the patients demonstrated an 
immediate and marked improvement. While this could 
represent a placebo effect, the enduring benefit, main-
tained in some cases for years, suggests that the benefit 
is at least in part related to a “microlesion” effect. Similar 
immediate postoperative improvement has been reported 
in lesion-based surgical approaches for TS.5 The remain-
ing patients required several months before experiencing 
a meaningful improvement, sometimes even without great 
changes in parameters. In this respect, the programming 
effect can be likened to that of dystonia, where improve-
ment may be seen immediately or only after months. As 
in the double-blind GPI study reported by Kefalopoulou 
et al.,20 improvement in the YGTSS score was most pro-
nounced in the impairment subscore. Although this could 
be an artifact of the nature of the rating scale, which is 
more heavily weighted toward impairment, it suggests 
that improvement in social stress is not solely correlated 
with the raw change in motor or vocal tic scores. This may 
explain why even patients without a robust improvement 
in the overall YGTSS scores reported feeling either “im-
proved” or “very much improved” on the Clinical Global 
Impression scale.
The overall benefit is also supported by answers to 
FIG. 2. A: Bar graph showing preoperative YGTSS impairment subscore versus the latest follow-up YGTSS impairment subscore. 
The average difference was 53% (p = 0.0015). Sixty-two percent of patients had a greater than 50% reduction in their subjective 
impairment score by their latest follow-up visit. This showed a positive correlation with the overall YGTSS score (R = 0.9044, p = 
0.000022). B: Bar graph showing the preoperative YGTSS motor subscore versus the latest follow-up subscore. The average dif-
ference was 50% (p = 0.0018). Sixty-three percent of patients had greater than 50% reduction in their motor tic symptoms by their 
latest follow-up visit. This showed a positive correlation with the overall YGTSS score (R = 0.8654, p = 0.00013). C: Bar graph 
showing preoperative YGTSS vocal subscore versus the latest follow-up vocal subscore. The average difference was 47% (p = 
0.0022). Forty-six percent of patients had greater than 50% reduction in their symptoms by their latest follow-up visit. This showed 
a positive correlation with the overall YGTSS score (R = 0.8575, p = 0.00018). D: Bar graph showing preoperative YBOCS score 
versus the latest follow-up YBOCS score. The average difference was 57% (p = 0.033, n = 12). Sixty-three percent of patients had 
greater than 50% reduction in their symptoms by their latest follow-up visit. One patient (Case 1) had no recorded YBOCS data 
and was not included in analysis, indicated by the lack of a bar. All comparisons were performed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank 
test. *A subscore/score of 0. Figure is available in color online only.

the 2-question survey, which was administered at least 6 
months after the procedure. All patients reported either 
much improved or very much improved symptoms on the 
Clinical Global Impression scale. In addition, all patients 
would be willing to have the surgery again, knowing what 
they know now, even those patients who had complications 
or experienced relatively less robust responses. Both pa-
tients who required hardware removal for infections expe-
rienced a significant increase in tics and were eager to have 
the DBS device reimplanted as soon as possible.
Approximately two-thirds of patients (63%) experi-
enced some improvement in OCD symptoms as corrobo-
rated by YBOCS scores, with the overall group experienc-
ing an average reduction of 57% over their preoperative 
scores. This did not achieve significance with our alpha 
cutoff of 0.01, but did trend toward significance. This is 
also consistent with the currently available literature on 
DBS for TS using the CM-PF as the target, although Bajwa 
et al. and Servello et al. reported more robust improvement 
in OCD scores.6,36
As mentioned above, the most ventral, best tolerated 
contact was selected for therapy. In most patients, stim-
ulation of the most ventral/deepest contact (0 left, 4 right) 
resulted in untoward side effects, and thus Contact 1 left/5 
right was most commonly used. Thus, the average stimu-
lation zone maps to the VOI/CM-PF junction, consistent

with the published literature. No apparent differences in 
the region of stimulation were observed between those 
with greater and lesser degrees of improvement.
The results of this observational study, like most of 
the DBS TS literature at this time, are limited by virtue 
of the small size and lack of randomization, blinding, or 
control group. Moreover, the variable nature of tics over 
time, compared with the progressive nature of Parkinson’s 
disease, further clouds the impact of DBS in TS. We can-
not exclude the possibility that some patients may have ex-
perienced an improvement in tic severity over time even 
without DBS. The worsening and subsequent improve-
ment in tics following device malfunction and revision, as 
previously reported in 1 patient, provides at least anecdotal 
evidence that stimulation plays a continuing role in long 
term-symptom control.30 These limitations continue to

 DBS for Tourette syndrome: a single-center series

prove to be a vexing challenge in establishing consensus 
and approval for DBS. Until such time when a multicenter 
study proves feasible, however, case series demonstrating 
efficacy and safety over long periods of time provide add-
ed support for DBS in severe, refractory cases of TS. The 
small size is partially compensated for by the large effect 
size demonstrated in this and other studies of DBS for TS. 
Of particular note with this cohort is the relatively young 
age of several patients (mean 20 years, range 16–33 years) 
compared with other publications and with the mean age 
of 29 years in the multicenter Tourette’s DBS database.27 
The appropriate minimum age to pursue DBS in TS, 
which may attenuate with time, remains an area of debate, 
as reflected in changing recommendations by consensus 
committees. Suggested guidelines published in 2006 rec-
ommended a minimum age of 25 years,26 whereas more 
recently proposed guidelines did not provide a cutoff but 
rather recommend “local ethics committee involvement” 
for patients younger than 18 years.35 Our medical rationale 
for inclusion of patients as young as 16 years old was one 
of benefit versus risk, where tics were so violent as to result 
in numerous hospitalizations as well as resultant social 
isolation, including an inability to drive or attend school. 
Establishing the appropriate minimum age for DBS in TS 
will likely remain an area of debate. Another important 
and unresolved question involves the optimal target for TS 
literature, demonstrating variable efficacy for a number of 
targets, predominantly focusing on the medial thalamus 
and globus pallidus.
The most recent large case series reported by Servello 
et al.37 was notable for a high rate of device removal (11 
of the original 48 device implants) due to “inflammatory 
complications or poor compliance.” As mentioned, device-
related complications, including infection and extension 
lead fracture, occurred in 2 of our patients, with 1 patient 
requiring 3 revisions over a 5-year period for extension 
lead fracture secondary to “twiddler’s syndrome.” This 
phenomenon (extension lead fracture) occurred despite 
the generator being replaced in a subpectoral pocket as 
described by Servello and colleagues.39 Our experience 
reinforces the perception that DBS for TS may be associ-
ated with a higher incidence of such complications when 
compared with other traditional indications for DBS. That 
the complication rate in a recent GPI TS cohort was 13%20 
suggests that complication rates are not target specific but 
more of an inherent challenge within this patient popula-
tion.
Conclusions
This study adds to the growing, but still small, body 
of literature regarding DBS for TS. It is also notable for 
the younger age of the cohort, which remains an area of 
debate regarding inclusion/exclusion criteria. This series, 
which follows patients for as long as 7 years after DBS, 
supports the potential for CM-PF DBS to improve severe, 
refractory TS symptoms with relatively few significant 
side effects. This retrospective, observational study, like 
many other DBS TS reports, is limited by its nonrandom-
ized, nonblinded nature and by the relatively small sample 
size. Clearly, a large, multicenter trial would be preferable, 
but innumerable challenges make such an eventuality un-
likely. Until such time, larger case series provide support 
that DBS of the CM-PF is an effective and safe treatment 
for TS.
