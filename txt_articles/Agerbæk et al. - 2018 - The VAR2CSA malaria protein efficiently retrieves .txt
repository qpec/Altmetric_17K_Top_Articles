Isolation of metastatic circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from cancer patients is of high value for
disease monitoring and molecular characterization. Despite the development of many new
CTC isolation platforms in the last decade, their isolation and detection has remained a
challenge due to the lack of specific and sensitive markers. In this feasibility study, we present
a method for CTC isolation based on the specific binding of the malaria rVAR2 protein to
oncofetal chondroitin sulfate (ofCS). We show that rVAR2 efficiently captures CTCs from
hepatic, lung, pancreatic, and prostate carcinoma patients with minimal contamination of
peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Expression of ofCS is present on epithelial and
mesenchymal cancer cells and is equally preserved during epithelial–mesenchymal transition
of cancer cells. In 25 stage I–IV prostate cancer patient samples, CTC enumeration sig-
nificantly correlates with disease stage. Lastly, rVAR2 targets a larger and more diverse
population of CTCs compared to anti-EpCAM strategies.

etastasis, the process in which malignant cells spread
from the primary tumor to distant sites, is of key
importance in cancer. Up to 90% of cancer-related
deaths are related to the metastatic spread of cancer cells1–3. This
complex process is vital to cancer progression and involves
intravasation of cancer cells into the blood stream2. The cancer
cells traveling in the blood are called circulating tumor cells
(CTCs)4,5, and a subset of these has increased metastatic capa-
city6. CTCs have spurred increasing clinical interest since their
levels in the blood were shown to be predictive of overall outcome
for patients with metastatic colorectal, breast, prostate, and lung
carcinomas7–10. Furthermore, the detection and enumeration of
CTCs in patient blood samples, also termed liquid biopsies,
provide a non-invasive tool for real-time monitoring of treatment
response and estimating risk for metastatic relapse11. Besides
enumeration, isolation of viable CTCs from blood enables indi-
vidual and longitudinal molecular characterization and down-
stream experimental analysis, irrespective of the availability of
tumor tissue biopsies. The ability to perform cellular analysis of
bulk CTCs, but also contained subpopulations of cells with
enhanced metastatic capacity, may represent a major advantage
over DNA-based approaches, such as the detection of circulating
tumor DNA12.
Several CTC detection and isolation platforms have been
described13. Many recently developed systems are based on dis-
tinct biophysical properties of CTCs such as their theoretically
larger size compared to peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMCs). However, studies have shown a large variation in CTC
size and a considerable size overlap between CTCs and PBMCs14.
Therefore, while these methods may provide viable CTCs,
separation purely based on size could be too restrictive and
introduce a considerable bias by missing important metastatic
cells for the downstream analysis. Other systems for CTC isola-
tion use antibodies to target epithelial markers, such as the epi-
thelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) cell surface protein. One
of these is the CellSearch® CTC platform, which relies on
detecting CTCs using anti-EpCAM antibody-coated magnetic
ferrofluid nanoparticles followed by bulk magnetic enrichment4.
In this platform, enriched cancer cells are identified as CTCs by
their cytokeratin (CK) positivity using a fluorescent-labeled
antibody, and potentially contaminating PBMCs are identified
by a CD45 counterstain. This system represents the current gold
standard for CTC enumeration and is approved by the US Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) for monitoring patients with
metastatic breast, colorectal, and prostate cancers15. Given the
heterogeneous nature of CTCs, EpCAM-based capture approa-
ches are inherently biased toward capturing CTCs with well-
preserved epithelial traits and are rarely efficient in epithelial
cancers with downregulated EpCAM expression, e.g., during
epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), or in cancers of
mesenchymal origin (i.e., sarcomas)16–18. In an attempt to
include these cells, many CTC isolation methods combine several
antibodies in an antibody cocktail and thereby target a larger
population of CTCs19–21. Such cocktails are, however, often only
applicable to specific tumor types and prone to capture more
non-cancer cells including white blood cells22,23. A similar con-
tamination issue arises when the inverse approach is taken and
CTCs are enriched by depletion of CD45-positive white blood
cells, most likely due to a considerable fraction of leukocytes with
low-level expression of surface marker14,24,25. Considering the
limitations of the above-described methods, it is clear that the
field would benefit greatly from a specific and universally
expressed cancer marker for capturing and detecting CTCs.
The isolation of CTCs requires a highly specific target, which is
completely absent from normal cells. In line with this, we have
recently described a uniquely modified form of chondroitin sulfate
(CS), termed oncofetal chondroitin sulfate (ofCS), which is
expressed by placental cells and cancer cells of both epithelial and
mesenchymal origin26. CS belongs to the family of glycosami-
noglycans (GAG), which are long, linear carbohydrates made up
of repeated disaccharide units that can be differentially modified
by disaccharide sulfations. CS can be attached to different proteins
called chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) on the cell
membrane or in the extracellular matrix. We have shown that
ofCS can be attached to more than 30 different proteoglycans26–30.
A single cancer cell may display different combinations of these
ofCS proteoglycans and thereby ofCS serves as a more robust
cancer biomarker as it is not restricted to the expression of a single
protein. CSPGs are often overexpressed in primary as well as
metastatic tumors, which, in combination with the expression of
the specific ofCS structure across a diverse array of tumor types
as well as its strict cancer specificity, makes them an appealing
target for the universal and efficient isolation and detection of
CTCs31.
We recently made the exciting discovery that the unique ofCS
can be detected by the VAR2CSA malaria protein26. In placental
malaria, parasite-infected erythrocytes adhere to ofCS in the
placenta using the malaria VAR2CSA protein as an anchor32.
Testing a wide range of cells and tissues, we found that the
recombinant VAR2CSA (rVAR2) protein also binds more than
95% of cancer cell lines and tissues of epithelial, mesenchymal,
and hematopoietic origin, with very limited binding to non-
cancerous cells or normal tissue (besides placental tissue)26. This
suggests that expression of ofCS is vital for the cellular attributes
of embryonic and cancer cells, such as rapid proliferation,
migration, and invasion26. We have shown that ofCS plays a key
role in tumor cell motility through canonical integrin signaling
pathways, and thus supports the metastatic potential of cancer
cells27. In line with this, we found ofCS to be highly expressed in
human metastatic lesions in situ and showed that rVAR2 could
inhibit metastasis of cancer cells in mice27. As rVAR2 shows
cancer-specific and origin-independent binding to ofCS both
prior to and after the metastatic process, we hypothesized that
rVAR2 could be a useful tool to broadly and efficiently capture
rare cancer cells in complex blood samples.
Here, we present a CTC isolation method based on rVAR2
conjugated to 4.5 µm streptavidin-coated magnetic CELLection™
Biotin Binder Dynabeads®. Using the IsoFlux™ System to retrieve
Dynabead-bound cells, we find a markedly enhanced CTC cap-
ture compared to EpCAM-based techniques in a diverse set of
clinical blood samples. Importantly, our data confirm that the
additionally captured subset of EpCAM-negative CTCs indeed
derives from the respective tumor site. Our data indicate that the
ofCS modification is independent of tumor type and cell differ-
entiation status, demonstrating the potentially broad applicability
of the rVAR2-based CTC isolation method.

rVAR2 binds to epithelial and mesenchymal cancer cells. Based
on the specific and high affinity binding of rVAR2 to ofCS on
cancer cells26, we sought to establish a cancer-specific and tumor-
type-independent
CTC isolation
method. To
examine
the
potential use of rVAR2 for binding of cancer cells in blood
samples, cancer cells of breast (MDA-MB-231, MCF7, Hs578T),
prostate (LNCaP, PC3, DU145), colorectal (COLO205, HT-29,
SW480), and lung carcinomas (A549) as well as osteosarcoma
(U2OS) and melanoma (C32) were mixed with PBMCs in a 1:1
ratio. Flow cytometry analysis showed that rVAR2 bound speci-
fically to cancer cells of epithelial and mesenchymal origin
(Table 1). It should be noted that while rVAR2 binding to DU145
cells was stronger than binding to PBMCs, rVAR2 binding of the

 other metastasis-derived prostate cancer cell lines LnCAP and
PC3 was even more pronounced.
Statistically, non-specific binding will dramatically increase
when the number of non-target cells increases33. Therefore, we
further verified the ability of rVAR2 to distinguish cancer cells
from PBMC, by mixing cancer cells with PBMCs in a 1:5000 ratio
and analyzing the samples for rVAR2 binding using a CytoTrack
scanning
device.
The
CytoTrack
system
allows
for
high
throughput, multispectral confocal imaging of CTCs in blood
samples34. The platform does not perform any prior enrichment
of CTCs and therefore the enumeration of rare cells relies solely
on specific biomarker detection using specific fluorescently
labeled probes. Following staining with His-tagged rVAR2 in
combination with an Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-penta His
antibody, the CytoTrack scanning device readily detected both
epithelial and mesenchymal human cancer cells in a background
of normal CD45-positive PBMCs (Fig. 1a).
These data indicate that an rVAR2-based CTC isolation
method would be cancer specific and independent of the
expression of epithelial markers. This was further confirmed by
performing dual staining with rVAR2 and an anti-EpCAM
antibody on nine different carcinoma cells lines, followed by flow
cytometry analysis. As expected, rVAR2 binding did not correlate
with the expression level of the epithelial marker EpCAM
(Fig. 1b).
rVAR2
binding
is
unaffected
by
phenotypic
plasticity.
Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) provides cancer cells
with a phenotypic plasticity that is thought to be essential for the
metastatic progression of primary carcinomas35–38. During this
transition, epithelial surface markers, such as EpCAM, can be
downregulated, rendering them less suitable targets for CTC
isolation. To determine whether ofCS expression is maintained
after the transition of a carcinoma cell toward a more mesench-
ymal phenotype, we induced EMT in the A549 lung adeno-
carcinoma cell line using TGF-β39. The induction of EMT
following TGF-β treatment was confirmed by decreased expres-
sion of the epithelial marker E-cadherin, whereas expression of
the mesenchymal markers vimentin and N-cadherin increased
(Fig. 2a, b). Accordingly, the cells gained an elongated mor-
phology and showed decreased expression of pan-CK, confirming
their transition (Fig. 2b). Most importantly, rVAR2 binding was
preserved, following induction of EMT as measured by flow
cytometry (Fig. 2c). Preserved rVAR2 binding to cancer cells after
EMT induction was also found for the human glioblastoma
U87mg cell line (Supplementary Fig. 1). While EMT most likely
drives the escape of cancer cells from the primary tumor site, the
reverse
process,
termed
mesenchymal–epithelial
transition
(MET), is thought to drive the colonization at the distant meta-
static site40,41. To explore whether the mesenchymal–epithelial
plasticity affects the expression of ofCS on cancer cells, we
removed TGF-β from the culture media of EMT-induced A549
cells42.
Seventy-two
hours
after
the
removal
of
TGF-β,
mesenchymal markers, such as fibronectin and N-cadherin, were
reduced, indicating that the A549 cells had returned to a more
epithelial state (Supplementary Fig. 2a). Furthermore, the Snail
EMT transcription factor, which was found upregulated as a
consequence of TGF-β treatment, was reduced to background
levels after the simplified MET (Supplementary Fig. 2a). Intri-
guingly, rVAR2 binding remained both through the EMT and
MET (Supplementary Fig. 2b).
rVAR2-coated beads capture cancer cells in blood samples.
Having confirmed that rVAR2 can detect a range of different
types of cancer cells in complex blood samples and that the
binding to cancer cells is maintained during EMT/MET, we
developed an rVAR2-based method to isolate CTCs. To allow
easy isolation of viable CTCs, we used magnetic CELLection™
Biotin Binder Dynabeads® and biotinylated rVAR2 to isolate
ofCS-positive CTCs on an IsoFlux™ microfluidic isolation system
(Fluxion). Instruments combining microfluidics with magnetic
micrometer-scale bead-based cell sorting have shown promising
results in detecting rare cells in complex blood samples14,43. On
the IsoFlux™ system, the cells are aligned within a microfluidic
channel and directed across a magnetic field isolation zone at
slow velocity43. This enables control of the time by which cells
reside in the isolation zone, ensuring high recovery of magneti-
cally labeled cells. In addition, unlabeled PBMCs are directed
away from the isolation zone by gravitational and hydrodynamic
forces, thereby improving the purity of the isolated CTC frac-
tion43. The rVAR2 construct used in this study was based on our
previously defined minimal ofCS binding region in the native full-
length VAR2CSA protein, which stretches over 121 kDa44. This
complicates direct conjugation of rVAR2 to beads, as it would
likely interfere with the capacity of rVAR2 to interact with ofCS.
To circumvent this problem, beads were coated with rVAR2
using a split protein conjugation system (SpyTag/SpyCatcher) in
a four step process45,46. First, rVAR2 was genetically modified to
include an N-terminal 13 amino acid SpyTag peptide. Second, the
corresponding 13 kDa SpyCatcher protein was produced recom-
binantly and biotinylated. Third, SpyTagged rVAR2 and the
biotinylated SpyCatcher were mixed resulting in the formation of
an isopeptide bond between the two proteins. Finally, this bioti-
nylated complex was immobilized on streptavidin-covered mag-
netic Dynabeads®. This procedure allowed conjugation of rVAR2
to magnetic beads without abolishing the ofCS-binding capacity
of rVAR2.
To test the ability of the rVAR2-coated magnetic beads to
capture cancer cells, we spiked 100 PC3 prostate cancer cells into
5 mL of healthy donor blood and assessed cancer cell retrieval.
First, red blood cells were eliminated by lysis, followed by a brief
incubation of the rVAR2-coated beads with the cell sample. The
cell-bead suspension was loaded onto the IsoFlux™ microfluidic
cartridge and automatically processed in the IsoFlux™ instrument.
Captured cells were manually transferred to slides, immobilized
by a strong magnet, and stained for pan-CK, CD45, and 4′, 6-
diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Cancer cells, defined as CK+,
CD45−, DAPI+, were enumerated using the Ariol System
software. Isolated PC3 prostate cancer cells showed clear CK

low-passage
pancreatic
ductal
adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells from patient-derived xenografts
(PDX) were used for further validation of the method. The
isolated PDAC cells were easily distinguished from white blood
cells by their CK+, CD45−, DAPI+ profile (Fig. 3b). To evaluate
the isolation method, we performed an exact enumeration of
three separate spike-in experiments using 100 cells. On average,
the isolation recovery was 83% and 90% for the PC3 and PDAC
cells, respectively (Fig. 3c). To further validate the efficiency of the
rVAR2-based CTC recovery, we assessed the recovery after
adding 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, or 500 PDAC cells to 5 mL blood. The
average percentage of recovered cells was between 86.0 and 91.9%
and the recovery did not vary systematically with the number of
cells added (correlation coefficient (R2) = 0.996) (Fig. 3d and
Table 2). Finally, we tested the sensitivity of cancer cell recovery
in a more challenging setup by spiking 5 mL of blood with only
three or six GFP-expressing PDAC cells. The average recovery for
five replicates was 60.0% and 76.7% for three and six cells spiked
in, respectively (Table 2). Collectively, these results show that
rVAR2-coated beads enable efficient isolation of cancer cells
spiked into a complex blood sample, demonstrating the high
sensitivity of the procedure.
rVAR2-coated beads capture CTCs in patient blood samples. In
order to test whether rVAR2-coated beads enabled the isolation
of CTCs from clinical samples, we analyzed blood samples from
patients with pancreatic (n = 9), hepatic (n = 4), prostate (n =
25), and lung (n = 6) cancer at different stages of disease. rVAR2-
coated beads captured CK+, CD45−, DAPI+ cells in all four
cancer types (Fig. 4a–c), whereas no CTCs were detected in blood
samples from healthy donors (n = 16).
Next, we sought to confirm that the isolated CK+, CD45−,
DAPI+ cells originated from the diagnosed tumor of the given
patient and thus were genuine CTCs. This was demonstrated in
four of the samples from patients with PDAC. As four of these

(ddPCR). ddPCR was performed on genomic DNA material
directly retrieved from the enumeration slide by microdissection.
As a positive control, we used the DNA extract from 100 primary
PDAC cells carrying the same mutation plus 5000 PBMCs. Table 3
summarizes the enumeration data as well as the ddPCR mutation
analysis. The G12 KRAS mutation numbers for each of the four
tested samples correlated with the CTC enumeration data,
indicating that the captured CTCs, defined by a CK+, CD45−,
DAPI+ profile, did indeed carry the KRAS mutation and thus
originated from the pancreatic tumor (Table 3).
rVAR2 captures more CTCs and less PBMCs. Our data suggest
that rVAR2 bears the potential for capturing a subset of non-
epithelial CTCs in addition to the classical epithelial CTCs. To
directly compare our ofCS-targeting CTC isolation method with
the more common EpCAM-targeting strategy, we aimed to cap-
ture CTCs in a subset of the blood samples from lung, prostate,
and pancreatic cancer patients using either rVAR2-coated or anti-
EpCAM antibody-coated beads on the IsoFlux™ system. The
rVAR2-based method detected higher CTC numbers than the
EpCAM-based method in all patient-matched blood samples
(Fig. 4d–f). On average the rVAR2-based CTC isolation resulted
in a 5.3×, 2.8×, or 6.4× higher CTC levels for lung (n = 4),
prostate (n = 15), and pancreatic (n = 6) cancer, respectively.
To characterize the isolated prostate CTCs, we stained rVAR2-
captured CTCs for EpCAM and anti-EpCAM antibody captured
CTCs for ofCS (using rVAR2). Only half of the rVAR2-captured
CTCs were EpCAM positive, whereas all cells retrieved by the
EpCAM-based method were ofCS positive as determined by
rVAR2 staining (Fig. 4g). As expected, these results support the
notion that the rVAR2-based CTC isolation results in the capture
of a broader spectrum of CTCs and that none of the EpCAM-
based captured CTCs are missed by rVAR2.
In order to confirm that the additional CK-positive cells
isolated by rVAR2 were indeed CTCs, we compared the
concentration (copies per microliter) of mutated KRAS genes in
four of the PDAC isolates by performing ddPCR on the material
from the CTC enumeration slide as described above. The
mutational analysis was consistent with the CTC enumeration,
showing an average of seven times higher levels of G12 KRAS

 mutation in the rVAR2 isolates compared to the EpCAM isolates
(Table 4). Likewise, a higher average mutant allele fraction (MAF)
for KRAS was found for the rVAR2-based CTC isolations (7.5%)
than the EpCAM-based CTC isolations (1.1%). The higher MAF
of the rVAR2-based CTC isolations most likely reflects the higher
number of isolated CTCs as well as a lower PBMC contamination
(Fig. 4h). On average, the number of contaminating PBMCs was
82% less after capturing ofCS-positive CTCs compared to the
EpCAM-based capture strategy (P < 0.0001, Wilcoxon test for
paired data) (n = 23).
To expand on these findings, we confirmed the presence of
mutated KRAS at a single cell level. rVAR2-isolated cells from two
of the pancreatic cancer blood samples were stained for EpCAM
in addition to the routine CK and CD45 used for detection. To
ensure high cell-picking efficiency, we applied the single cell
isolation workflow developed by Neumann et al.47. The bead-
coated cells were placed on a glass slide and processed using the
automated micromanipulator CellCelector (ALS, Jena, Germany).
A magnetic field kept the cells in situ and five EpCAM-positive
(EpCAM+, CK+, CD45−, DAPI+) and five EpCAM-negative
(EpCAM−, CK+, CD45−, DAPI+) single cells were selected
based on morphological criteria. Preference was given to
individual cells with small round shape and an individual nucleus
without signs of DNA fragmentations. Total RNA from picked
single cells was isolated and used for cDNA synthesis. Following
preamplification, the presence of KRAS mutations was verified by
ddPCR. All EpCAM-positive and EpCAM-negative cells carried
the expected KRAS mutation (Supplementary Fig. 3).
As our results indicated that rVAR2-captured CTCs could
contain a mesenchymal subpopulation, we stained CTC enriched
samples from two lung cancer patients for the mesenchymal
marker vimentin. Samples from both patients contained cells that
were double positive for CK and vimentin, strongly supporting
our hypothesis that rVAR2 efficiently captures CTCs with an
intermediate epithelial and mesenchymal phenotype (Fig. 4i).
Notably, a minor fraction of the double-negative cells (CK−,
CD45−, DAPI+) was found to be vimentin positive, suggesting
the presence of mesenchymal CK− CTCs within the rVAR2-
enriched cell population.
rVAR2 can be used for CTC isolation in early-stage cancer. To
test our rVAR2-based capture of prostate CTCs against the cur-
rent clinical practice, four patient-matched blood samples were
also analyzed on the CellSearch® CTC platform. The EpCAM
capture on this platform did not detect CTCs above the pre-
specified cut off (≥2 CTCs per 7.5 mL blood) in any of the tested
samples (Fig. 5a). However, it should be noted that the Cell-
Search® CTC platform was validated in metastatic prostate cancer
while we in this case tested stage II prostate cancer patients9.
Nevertheless, the EpCAM-based capture analyzed on the IsoFlux™
detected 5, 8, 5, and 5 CTCs in the patient-matched samples
(estimated from the 5 mL capture as shown in Fig. 4d). Inter-
estingly, the rVAR2-based detection method captured the highest
number of cells with 12, 23, 15, and 23 CTCs, respectively, in the
four patient samples (estimated from the 5 mL capture as shown

 in Fig. 4d). Thus, considerably more CTCs were isolated using
rVAR2.
To test whether the rVAR2 method had the potential to predict
disease stage, rVAR2-based CTC numbers from prostate cancer
patient blood samples (n = 25 from Fig. 4a) were classified according
to the disease stage of the patient. CTCs were isolated from all
patients, including all those in stage I and II (n = 14), and the
number of captured CTCs showed a statistically significant
association with patient disease stage (P = 0.0001, Kruskal–Wallis
rank test) (Fig. 5b). Importantly, no CTCs were detected in blood
from any of the healthy controls (n = 16) or patients with different
non-malignant diseases (n = 12). Intriguingly, these data suggest that
the rVAR2-based method could be used for CTC detection and
staging in low-grade disease stages.
Discussion
We have previously shown that ofCS is presented by nearly all
cancer cells26. This suggests that ofCS could be an ideal target for
the isolation of CTCs in a wide range of cancer types. In this
study, we show that the rVAR2 malaria protein specifically
detects ofCS on a variety of cancer cells in complex blood sam-
ples. Based on this, we developed a highly efficient CTC isolation

 protocol using the ofCS-targeting rVAR2 protein and magnetic
beads in combination with the IsoFlux™ system. The analytical
performance was evaluated and showed excellent recovery when
cell lines and more heterogeneous primary cancer cells, ranging in
numbers from 3 to 500 cells, were spiked into 5 mL blood from
healthy donors. Importantly, this protocol enabled isolation of
CTCs from pancreatic, hepatic, lung, and prostate cancer patients
at various stages of disease, illustrating the broad applicability of
the rVAR2-based CTC isolation method. Furthermore, we
showed that rVAR2 resulted in a higher CTC yield in blood
samples from prostate, pancreatic, and lung cancer patients as
compared
to
EpCAM-based
isolation
of
patient-matched
samples.
It is interesting that rVAR2 captures more CTCs in all tested
blood samples. One explanation could be the wide distribution of
ofCS on cancer cells. ofCS is a secondary modification to a wide
range of different CSPGs, of which multiple are co-expressed on
different cancer cells. rVAR2 isolation of CTCs is therefore not
dependent on the expression of a single marker27. It is likely that
the expression of ofCS on multiple membrane bound proteins
increases the density of target antigen on the cell surface and
thereby improves the sensitivity of the rVAR2-based CTC isola-
tion strategy compared to that of targeting a single protein, like
EpCAM, which is more sensitive to protein up or down-
regulation. Another explanation for the increase in CTC recovery
is that ofCS is simply present on a broader spectrum of the
patient CTCs. This is substantiated by the fact that only a fraction
of the rVAR2-captured CTCs showed EpCAM positivity, while all
the EpCAM-captured CTCs were ofCS positive. The EpCAM−,
CK+, CD45− cells captured by rVAR2 were confirmed to be
genuine CTCs by KRAS mutation analysis on single cells from
pancreatic cancer patient blood samples. While most carcinomas
are considered EpCAM positive, the expression of EpCAM is
often heterogenous within the tumor. The intratumoral hetero-
geneity as well as a potential transition toward a more
mesenchymal phenotype could partly explain why EpCAM-based
methods only detect a fraction of the CTCs, despite the epithelial
origin of the tumor. In contrast, we show that rVAR2 binding to
cancer cells is maintained after induction of EMT. In line with
this, we demonstrate that the rVAR2-enriched CTC population
from cancer patients contains vimentin-positive cells as well as
EpCAM-negative cells, indicating that the rVAR2 isolates include
mesenchymal-like subpopulations. Interestingly, the observed
ofCS display on mesenchymal-like carcinoma cells is in accor-
dance with our recently published work where we demonstrated
that ofCS plays a key role in cancer cell motility through integrin
signaling pathways, and thus seems to be a requirement for
cancer cells to invade and metastasize27. A complete analysis of
the mesenchymal subsets of CTCs is, however, beyond the scope
of this study. As CK represents a validated marker for CTC
detection, we chose to stain the bead-captured cells and define
CTCs based on being CK+, DAPI+, and CD45−. Therefore, the
CTC enumeration used for this study is still dependent on the
expression of the epithelial marker, CK. As shown for the A549
lung cancer cell line, CK is also frequently downregulated during
EMT and this has also been noted for the contained subset of
cancer stem cells6. Thus, it is likely that capturing CTCs with
rVAR2 followed by CK detection will miss certain subsets of
CTCs. Intriguingly, Vim+, CK−, CD45− cells were detected in
two blood samples from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
patients and they may represent mesenchymal CTCs. Future
studies will have to define and further validate the nature of the
captured vimentin+, CK− putative CTCs. Collectively, our data
suggest that rVAR2 specifically binds cancer cells regardless of
their state of epithelial differentiation, and thus will enable the
isolation of additional subsets of CTCs. These results do, how-
ever, not rule out that rVAR2− EpCAM+ CTC may exist, as
suggested by the weak rVAR2 staining on DU145 cells (Fig. 1b).
Future studies could study the combined use of EpCAM and
rVAR2 for capturing CTCs to examine the potential cumulative
effect.
In addition to giving higher CTC yields, the rVAR2-based
isolation also resulted in a low contamination of PBMCs com-
pared to the EpCAM-based isolation on the IsoFlux™ system. The
number of CD45+, CK−, DAPI+ PBMCs in the rVAR2 isolates
was not affected by disease stage, and healthy as well as non-
malignant disease subjects showed equal numbers of PBMCs.

 Despite the overexpression of CSPGs on cancer cells, CS in
general is present on all cells including PBMCs. However, the
decrease in PBMC contamination supports our previous findings
that rVAR2 exhibits a high specificity toward the cancer-specific
ofCS modification26. In combination with the high CTC levels,
the relative purity of the CTC isolates makes the rVAR2-based
method suitable for downstream analysis such as whole-genome
sequencing.
Currently, the only FDA-approved CTC detection platform,
CellSearch®, is based on positive EpCAM selection of cells in
patient blood. Our test of blood samples from four prostate
cancer patients on the FDA-approved CellSearch® CTC platform
yielded only one or no CTCs per sample. This is below the
threshold for abnormality set forth for the instrument4. However,
the CellSearch® CTC platform was validated in metastatic pros-
tate cancer while we in this case tested stage II prostate cancer
patients. Surprisingly, significantly more CTCs were isolated
using the same isolation target, EpCAM, on the IsoFlux™ system.
Direct comparison of the CTC isolation by the two different
platforms is, however, difficult due to the use of different anti-
body clones and magnetic beads for capture. The IsoFlux™ system
utilizes micrometer-scale beads which have shown to result in a
magnetic moment that is sufficient for capturing cells even with
low target expression43. This is likely to increase the sensitivity
compared to the nanoscaled magnetic particles used in the FDA-
approved CellSearch® CTC platform43. Also, the IsoFlux™ system
uses microfluidic flow based enrichment of magnetically labeled
cells, which increases the purity of the final output compared to
no-flow bulk isolation43. Furthermore, differences in the valida-
tion stainings and the criteria used when assigning an object as a
CTC could potentially affect the analytical interpretation of the
result33. Thus, there are important technical differences between
the two instruments that may explain at least in part the differ-
ences in CTC counts.
The data from this study clearly indicate that rVAR2 combined
with the IsoFlux™ system results in markedly higher assay sensi-
tivity, which could be an important factor in the clinic, as it
reduces the number of cancer cases with false negative tests and
potentially allows for CTC detection at earlier stages of disease. In
addition, the increased sensitivity could make the rVAR2-based
method suitable for risk monitoring in patients suffering from
cancer types with reportedly low CTC levels as well as detection
of minimal residual disease after therapy or surgical resection of a
tumor. To further explore the clinical potential of the rVAR2-
based method, CTC enumerations in 25 prostate cancer patients
were associated with disease stage. Despite the relatively low
number of patient samples available, the difference in levels of
CTCs between the four stages of disease was remarkable. Thus,
rVAR2 could potentially provide means for assessing the stage of
the disease. However, large-scale prospective clinical trials are
warranted to validate the clinical sensitivity as well as prognostic
value of this CTC capture method.
In conclusion, we describe an efficient and cancer-specific
method for the isolation of CTCs in complex blood samples using
a recombinant VAR2CSA malaria protein. We show that
rVAR2 specifically detects ofCS, a uniquely modified form of CS,
on a wide variety of cancer cells, regardless of tumor origin. The

 rVAR2-based CTC isolation method showed markedly increased
CTC retrieval compared to EpCAM-based techniques when
testing blood from prostate, lung, and pancreatic cancer patients.
Taken together, the rVAR2-based method not only provides a
more sensitive and universal tool for CTC detection with the
potential of a high clinical impact, but also allows for isolation of
more, if not all, subsets of CTCs, which is of great value for
downstream cellular analysis. This will hopefully provide further
insights into the cellular characteristics of the highly metastatic
subpopulation of cancer cells circulating in the blood of cancer
patients, and thereby improve our understanding of metastasis
formation and potentially enable the development of more effi-
cient therapies.
Methods
Cell cultures. Sw480, COLO205, LNCaP, C32, Hs578t, and PDX-derived PDAC
cells were cultured in RPMI 1640, whereas A549, PC-3, DU145, U2OS, and MDA-
MB-231 were cultured in DMEM, HT-29 in McCoy’s, and MCF7 in EMEM with
an additional supplement of 0.01 mg/mL insulin. All media for the cancer cell
cultures were purchased from Sigma Aldrich and supplemented with 10% FBS, L-
glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin. All commercial cell lines originated from
ATCC®. We regularly tested for mycoplasma contamination and none of the cell
lines used in this paper have tested positive. Due to limitations of the in-house
facilities, authentication of each cell line by genotyping is still in progress. None of
the cell lines used in this paper are listed in the database of commonly misidentified
cell lines maintained by ICLAC. For retrieval of the PDX-derived PDAC cells,
human tissue was obtained with written informed consent from all patients and
expanded in vivo as PDX. PDX-354 was processed as previously described48.
Briefly, PDX-derived tumors were minced and enzymatically digested with col-
lagenase (STEMCELL Technologies) for 90 min at 37 °C, and after centrifugation
for 5 min at 1200 rpm, cell pellets were resuspended and cultured in RPMI
(Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS and 50 U/mL penicillin–streptomycin.
Primary cultures were tested for mycoplasma contamination every 2 weeks
(MycoAlert™ Mycoplasma Detection Kit, Lonza).
Production of rVAR2. The subunit DBL1-ID2a of VAR2CSA (rVAR2) was
recombinantly expressed in Escherichia coli as previously described49. In brief, the
FCR3 DBL1-ID2a with a C-terminal V5 tag, penta-His tag, and a split protein tag
sequence was inserted into a modified pET15b plasmid (Novagen) and trans-
formed to SHuffle T7 Express Competent E. coli cells (New England Biolabs,
C3029H). Following lysis of the cell pellet, rVAR2 expressed in a soluble form was
purified by immobilized affinity chromatography (IMAC) followed by size-
exclusion chromatography. Purity of the protein was confirmed by SDS page and
Western blot, whereas specificity toward ofCS was ensured in ELISA and on cancer
cells using flow cytometry.
Flow cytometry. Blood samples were collected in CPDA Vacuette tubes and
PBMCs were isolated using a Lymphoprep gradient. PBMCs were mixed with
cancer cells in a 1:1 ratio and incubated with 250 nM rVAR2 or as otherwise
indicated for 30 min at 4 °C. Following three wash steps in PBS with 2% FBS, cells
were incubated with anti-penta His Alexa Fluor 488 (Cat. No. 35310, Qiagen,
1:500)50 and data were acquired using a FC500 flow cytometer (Beckmann
Coulter). Secondary antibody controls were included in all experiments by adding
only anti-penta His Alexa Fluor 488 without the His-tagged rVAR2. EpCAM levels
in cancer cell lines were detected by an anti-human EpCAM antibody [VU-1D9]
PE (Cat. No. ab112068, Abcam, 1:75)51. Mean fluorescence intensities (MFIs) were
analyzed using FlowJo™ software.
Induction of EMT. A549 cells were seeded at a density of 3000 cells/cm2 in DMEM
supplemented with 10% FBS, L-glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin. After
attachment, cells were starved in 0.5% FBS for 24 h. Cells were subsequently treated
with 10 ng/mL TGF-β (Cat. No. phg9214, Life Technologies) or TGF-β suspension
buffer as control (40 mM acetic acid, 0.1% BSA in ultra-pure water) for 24, 48, or
72 h to induce EMT. Transition was confirmed by morphology changes and a
change in expression of epithelial and mesenchymal markers using Western blot
and immunofluorescence studies. For the MET studies, TGF-β was replaced by
DMEM with 0.5% FBS after 72 h EMT induction and the partial return of the A549
cells to their epithelial state was observed for another 72 h.
For Western blots, cells were lysed with EBC lysis buffer for 30 min and the
protein extract was balanced using a Bradford assay. Equal amount of protein
lysates were loaded onto a NuPAGE Bis-Tris gel (ThermoFisher Scientific) after
which samples were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Biorad). Transfer
was confirmed using Ponceau red staining and the membranes were blocked in 5%
skimmed milk powder in TBS-T. Anti-GAPDH (14C10) antibody (Cat. No. 2118,
Cell Signaling, 1:1000)52, anti-fibronectin antibody (Cat. No. 610077, BD

cadherin (1:500), anti-Snail (1:500), and anti-β-catenin (1:500) primary antibodies
from the EMT Antibody Sampler Kit (Cat. No. 9782S, Cell Signaling)54 were added
to the membrane in TBS-T supplemented with 2% skimmed milk powder and
incubated overnight at 4 °C. To reduce antibody levels, the blots were cut into
smaller lanes based on the molecular target size prior to antibody incubation
(Supplementary Fig. 4). Following three washes in TBS-T, the membranes were
incubated with anti-rabbit HRP (Cat. No. 9782S, Cell Signaling, 1:1000)54 for 1 h at
room temperature and the reactivity was detected using LumiGlo Reserve
Chemiluminescent Substrate (KPL).
For immunofluorescence studies, cells were grown on glass slides and fixed in
4% formaldehyde, washed three times in PBS, blocked with 1% BSA, 5% FBS, and
0.3% Tween in PBS for 1 h at room temperature, incubated overnight at 4 °C with
anti-pan CK Alexa Fluor 488 (Ca. No. 53-9003-82, eBioscience, 1:500) or primary
anti-E-cadherin and anti-vimentin antibodies from the EMT Antibody Sampler Kit
(Cat. No. 9782S, Cell Signaling, 1:200)55 made in PBS with 1% BSA and 0.3%
Triton X-100. After three washes in PBS, the fixed cells were incubated with
secondary Fluorescein (FITC) Anti-Rabbit IgG Antibody (Cat. No. FI-1000, Vector
Laboratories, 1:200)56 for 1 h at room temperature. For analysis of F-actin, cells
were blocked in 1% BSA and stained with Alexa Fluor® 594 Phalloidin (Cat. No.
A12381, ThermoFisher, 1:40)57 for 20 min at room temperature. All cells were
stained with DAPI (Cat. No. D1306, Life Technologies)26 and mounted using
FluorSave Reagent (Merck Millipore). Staining was analyzed using a Nikon TE
2000-E confocal microscope with 60× oil immersion objective lens (DIC).
CytoTrack. One-hundred cancer cells were mixed with 500,000 PBMC. Cells were
incubated with 250 nM rVAR2 for 30 min at 4 °C and secondarily with anti-penta
His Alexa Fluor 488 (Cat. No. 35310, Qiagen, 1:500) and anti-human CD45 Cy5
(Cat. No. 19-0459, eBioscience, 1:10)34. After fixation in 4% formaldehyde, the cells
were stained with DAPI (Cat. No. D1306, Life Technologies) and mounted on glass
slides using FluorSave Reagent (Merck Millipore). rVAR2-positive cells were
located using a CytoTrack CT4 Scanner. The resulting table of hotspots was sub-
sequently analyzed for morphology and rVAR2, DAPI, and CD45 staining, as
described34.
Preparation of rVAR2- or anti-EpCAM antibody-coated beads. The recombi-
nantly expressed VAR2CSA (rVAR2) protein used in the rVAR2 CTC isolation
method was designed to include a 13-amino-acids peptide (SpyTag) from the
fibronectin-binding protein Fba N-terminally, which enables covalent isopeptide
bond formation to a biotinylated 12 kDa SpyCatcher protein45. The SpyCatcher
was produced in E. coli Bl21 as a soluble poly-HIS tagged protein, and purified by
Ni++ affinity chromatography. Purity was determined by SDS page and quality of
protein was ensured by testing the capacity to form an isopeptide bond to a tagged
protein. The tagged rVAR2 and biotinylated SpyCatcher fragment were incubated
at room temperature for 1 h. After this step, the protein was incubated with
CELLection™ Biotin Binder Dynabeads® (4.5 µm) at room temperature for at least
30 min resulting in rVAR2-coated beads (0.43 µg biotinylated protein per micro-
liter bead suspension). For the EpCAM-based detection, CELLection™ Pan Mouse
IgG Dynabeads® (4.5 µm) in combination with an anti-EpCAM antibody [Ber-
EP4] (Cat. No. ab7504, abcam)58 were used. Anti-EpCAM antibody and beads
were incubated for 30 min (0.02 µg anti-EpCAM antibody per microliter bead
suspension). Remaining protein or antibody was removed by carefully washing the
beads in PBS containing 0.1% BSA three times, each time using a neodymium
magnet (10 × 12 mm) for dragging beads into a pellet.
Cell culture and spike-in preparations. Prior to the spike-in experiments, PC3
cells or primary PDAC (PDX-derived) cells were harvested using trypsin−EDTA
(Sigma-Aldrich) and resuspended in culture medium. Cell concentration was
measured by manually counting the number of viable cells in a 1:1 mixture with
Trypan Blue solution (Sigma-Aldrich). The suspensions were subsequently spiked
into blood to achieve the desired concentrations.
GFP-expressing PDAC cells were used for the spike-in experiment with three
and six cells. To ensure a precise cell count before spike-in, we did serial dilutions
and placed the cells in a low-adhesion 96-well plate. After validation of the cell
counts by microscopy, the cells were transferred to 5 mL of blood. These samples
were then processed as described below with the exception of the CK staining.
CTC isolation from blood. Blood samples were collected under the Barts Cancer
Tissue Biobank Ethics committee protocol and informed written consent was
obtained for all enrolled subjects. Blood was received in K2 EDTA tubes and
processed within 2 h. The blood samples were divided into aliquots of 5 mL and red
blood cells were lysed in 45 mL Red Blood Cell (RBC) lysis buffer containing 0.155
M ammonium chloride, 0.01 M potassium hydrogen carbonate, and 0.1 mM EDTA
for 10 min. After centrifugation at 400×g for 8 min, the cell pellet was gently
washed in PBS once. The centrifugation step was repeated, and finally cells were
resuspended in RPMI medium containing 1% FBS in addition to 1 mM CaCl2 and
5 mM MgCl2 and transferred to a low retention microcentrifuge tube (Fish-
erbrand). Under these conditions, cells were incubated with ~1.6E6 rVAR2- or
anti-EpCAM antibody-coated magnetic beads at 4 °C. Cancer cells adhering to
beads were retrieved by running the isolation protocol on the IsoFlux™ machine

 (Fluxion). Isolated cancer cells were hereafter retrieved in 200 µL RPMI medium
containing 1% FBS in addition to 1 mM CaCl2 and 5 mM MgCl2 and transferred to
a low retention microcentrifuge tube (Fisherbrand). A neodymium cylinder magnet
was used to drag cells bound to beads toward the bottom of the tube, enabling
removal of the supernatant. The cells were then fixed in 4% PFA for 10 min and
added onto glass slides, on which a circle with the same size as the magnet had
been drawn using a water repellent Dako pen. When adding or removing buffer
from the cells, the glass slide was placed on top of the magnet. The cells were
blocked for 5 min in 10% normal donkey serum (NDS) prior to stain with PE-
conjugated anti-CD45 [5B-1] antibody (Cat. No. 130-080-201, MACS Miltenyi
Biotec, 1:100)59 for 30 min at room temperature. Hereafter, cells were permeabi-
lized using 0.2% Triton X-100 diluted in PBS containing 0.5% BSA and 2 mM
EDTA. This step was followed by staining of the cells with FITC-conjugated anti-
CK [CK3-6H5] antibody (Cat. No. 130-080-101, MACS Miltenyi Biotec, 1:10)60 for
30 min at room temperature. To enable visualization of cell nuclei, the cells were
stained with DAPI. The sample was mounted using Dako Faramount Aqueous
Mounting Medium.
Quantification of cancer cells. Enumeration of cancer cells was done manually
using the Ariol image analysis system (Leica Biosystems Ltd., UK) with an
Olympus BX61 microscope. Cancer cells were identified as CK+, CD45−, DAPI+
cells. PBMCs were identified as CK−, CD45+, DAPI+ cells.
Four-color immunofluorescence staining on cancer cells. CTCs from prostate
cancer patients isolated using rVAR2-coated beads were stained for EpCAM
positivity using an anti-EpCAM antibody [Ber-EP4] (Cat. No. ab7504, abcam,
1:100) in combination with an Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated goat anti-Mouse IgG
secondary antibody (Cat. No. A-21235, Invitrogen, 1:200). CTCs from prostate
patients isolated using anti-EpCAM antibody-coated beads were stained for rVAR2
positivity using rVAR2 protein containing a V5-tag in combination with a FITC-
conjugated anti-V5 antibody (Cat. No. R963-25, Invitrogen, 1:100)26. For these
samples, the CK positivity was observed using an anti-CK (CK3-6H5) antibody
(Cat. No. 130-090-866, MACS Miltenyi Biotec, 1:10) in combination with an Alexa
Fluor 647-conjugated goat anti-Mouse IgG secondary antibody (Cat. No. A-21235,
Invitrogen, 1:200)61.
For vimentin staining, cells were stained with FITC-conjugated anti-CK (CK3-
6H5) antibody (Cat. No. 130-080-101, MACS Miltenyi Biotec, 1:10), and anti-
vimentin (EP21) antibody (Cat. No. AC0024, Epitomics, 1:50) in combination with
an Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Cat. No. A-31573,
Invitrogen, 1:200).
Verification of PDAC CTCs using ddPCR. Total genomic DNA (gDNA) was
extracted directly from the sample material on the slide used for enumeration
(QIAamp DNA Micro Kit, Qiagen). The QX100 Droplet Digital PCR System
(ddPCR, Biorad), PrimePCR KRAS mutant, and WT assays (Biorad,
dHsaCP2000001 (G12D), dHsaCP2000002 (G12D WT), dHsaCP2000005 (G12V),
dHsaCP2000006 (G12V WT), dHsaCP2000009 (G12R), and dHsaCP2000010
(G12R WT)) were used to detect the following KRAS mutations in gDNA: G12D,
G12V, and G12R. A total 50 ng of gDNA was used for each PCR. PDAC 215
(G12D), PDAC 247 (G12V), and PDAC JH033 (G12R) were used for positive
controls and leukocytes of a healthy donor served as a negative control. In ddPCR,
the samples containing gDNA were partitioned into 20,000 droplets and loaded
into thermo cycler. Following PCR amplification, droplets from each sample are
streamed in single file through the droplet reader. Absolute concentration of KRAS
mutant and WT DNA copies were determined using the QuantaSoft software
provided by the manufacturer. Briefly, positive droplets which contain at least one
copy of the target exhibit increased fluorescence. The system detects Mutant (HEX)
and WT (FAM) alleles by counting the number of droplets positive for each
fluorophore.
Single cell isolation using the CellCelector. CTCs were immunofluorescently
stained with FITC-conjugated anti-CK [CK3-6H5] antibody (Cat. No. 130-080-
101, MACS Miltenyi Biotec, 1:10), PE-conjugated anti-CD45 [5B-1] antibody (Cat.
No. 130-080-201, MACS Miltenyi Biotec, 1:100), EpCAM [Ber-EP4] (Cat. No.
ab7504, Abcam, 1:100) with Goat anti-Mouse Alexa Fluor® 647 (AF647) secondary
antibody (Cat. No. A-21235, ThermoFisher, 1:200), and DAPI.
Single cells were isolated using an automated micromanipulator, CellCelector
(ALS GmbH, Jena, Germany). This system consists of an inverted fluorescent
microscope (CKX41, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) with a CCD camera system (XM10-
IR, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) and a vertical 30 µm glass capillary on a robotic arm.
ALS CellCelector Software 3.0 (ALS, Jena, Germany) was used for analysis. Labeled
cell solutions were transferred to a glass slide and cells were allowed to settle. The
cells were visualized by bright field (BF) and fluorescent microscopy for nuclear
DAPI and CD45-PE staining to verify morphology and CD45 negativity at 20×
magnification. Then CK+EpCAM+ and CK+EpCAM− target cells were detected
in the FITC and AF647 channel at 40× magnification. The target cells were
detected by the software following pre-defined settings, manually approved, and
then fully automatically aspirated and transferred into PCR tubes containing 100 μl
of lysis buffer of the Guanidine Thiocynate (GTC) Method. Total RNA was isolated
by the GTC method using standard protocols62. The purified RNA was used for
cDNA synthesis using the SuperScript VILO Master Mix according to the
manufacturer’s recommendations (Cat. No. 1455280, Invitrogen), followed by
preamplification using AmpliTaq Gold 360 Master Mix (Cat. No. 4398881, Applied
Biosystems), and 200 nM each of forward and reverse primers for KRAS [5′-CTGA
AAATGACTGAATATAAACTTGTGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-TAGCTGTATCGTC
AAGGCACTC-3′ (reverse)]. Preamplified DNA was used for KRAS mutation
detection by ddPCR. Consistent with the analysis of total genomic CTC extract, the
PrimePCR KRAS mutant and WT assays (Biorad, dHsaCP2000001 (G12D),
dHsaCP2000002 (G12D WT), dHsaCP2000005 (G12V), and dHsaCP2000006
(G12V WT)) were used to detect the G12D and G12V KRAS mutations.
CellSearch. The identification of CTCs utilizing the CellSearch® CTC platform
(Celltracks Autoprep and Celltracks Analyzer II) was performed as per the man-
ufacturer’s instructions. Informed consent was obtained from all subjects and blood
samples were collected in CellSave tubes. The CTC assay was performed with the
CellSearch® CTC Kit, which contains reagents for immunomagnetic isolation of
EpCAM-positive cells. The isolated cells were stained with DAPI, PE-conjugated
CK monoclonal antibodies, and APC-labeled CD45 monoclonal antibody
(CELLTRACKS® AUTOPREP® System).
Statistics. STATA 14 software was used for all analyses. The effect on rVAR2
binding by treating A549 cells with TGFβ was tested in three independent
experiments by declaring MFI data to be panel data and testing the effect of TGFβ
treatment versus control in a generalized least squares regression model using the
xtgls command including treatment group and ln(rVAR2) concentration as
explanatory variables (Fig. 2c).
The ability of the anti-EpCAM and rVAR2 assays to capture CTC from patient
samples were compared by Wilcoxon rank sum test for paired data. P values are
from two-sided tests (Fig. 4d–f). The association between cancer stage and number
of CTC detected by rVAR2 was tested by Kruskal–Wallis test followed by
comparing groups by the Mann–Whitney U test (Fig. 5b).
