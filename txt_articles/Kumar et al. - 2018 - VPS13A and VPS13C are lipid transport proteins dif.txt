Mutations in the human VPS13 genes are responsible for neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders including 
chorea acanthocytosis (VPS13A) and Parkinson’s disease (VPS13C). The mechanisms of these diseases are unknown. Genetic 
studies in yeast hinted that Vps13 may have a role in lipid exchange between organelles. In this study, we show that the 
N-terminal portion of VPS13 is tubular, with a hydrophobic cavity that can solubilize and transport glycerolipids between 
membranes. We also show that human VPS13A and VPS13C bind to the ER, tethering it to mitochondria (VPS13A), to late 
endosome/lysosomes (VPS13C), and to lipid droplets (both VPS13A and VPS13C). These findings identify VPS13 as a lipid 
transporter between the ER and other organelles, implicating defects in membrane lipid homeostasis in neurological 
disorders resulting from their mutations. Sequence and secondary structure similarity between the N-terminal portions of 
Vps13 and other proteins such as the autophagy protein ATG2 suggest lipid transport roles for these proteins as well.
VPS13A and VPS13C are lipid transport proteins 
differentially localized at ER contact sites

Introduction
A major path for the transport of bilayer lipids between mem-
branes is vesicular transport. However, this route can be by-
passed by lipid transport proteins that extract lipids from a 
membrane, shield them from the aqueous cytosolic environment 
within hydrophobic cavities, and deliver them to a target mem-
brane. Often, these proteins also function as tethers between two 
participating organelles, thus making transport more efficient 
(Holthuis and Menon, 2014; Lahiri et al., 2015; Gatta and Levine, 
2017; Saheki and De Camilli, 2017). Protein-mediated transport 
is particularly important for lipid exchange between the ER and 
mitochondria as these two organelles are not connected by mem-
brane traffic, yet mitochondria use precursors imported from the 
ER to produce most of their lipids (Dimmer and Rapaport, 2017). 
Conversely, lipids generated in mitochondria can be delivered to 
the ER for distribution to other membranes (Voelker, 1984).
Yeast studies have suggested that the ER–mitochondria en-
counter structures (ERM 
ES) complex mediates this bidirectional 
lipid transport between the ER and mitochondria (Kornmann 
et al., 2009; AhYoung et al., 2015; Jeong et al., 2016). However, 
other pathways for ER–mitochondria lipid transfer must also 
exist (Elbaz-Alon et al., 2014; Hönscher et al., 2014) as ERM 
ES 
deletion is not lethal (Lang et al., 2015). A protein that may func-
tion in such a pathway is Vps13, as spontaneous gain-of-function 
mutations in its gene could rescue the growth defect of yeast 
ERM 
ES mutants (Lang et al., 2015). Additionally, mutants lacking 
both ERM 
ES and Vps13 are not viable (Lang et al., 2015). Vps13 
localizes at contacts between the mitochondria and the vacuole 
(so called v-CLA 
MPs, for vacuole and mitochondria patches) and 
between the vacuole and the ER (nuclear–vacuole junction; NVJ; 
Lang et al., 2015). An interesting hypothesis is that Vps13 may 
mediate lipid transfer between the vacuole and other membranes 
and that it may provide an alternative indirect path for the flow 
of specific lipids between the ER and mitochondria via the vac-
uole. Defects in mitochondria membrane integrity observed in 
yeast mutants lacking either ERM 
ES complex components or 
Vps13 (Hanekamp et al., 2002; Park et al., 2016) are consistent 
with this possibility. However, so far, there is no direct evidence 
that Vps13 can transfer lipids.
While the ERM 
ES complex is not conserved in metazoan cells, 
members of the VPS13 family are expressed in all animal spe-
cies, including humans, whose genome contains four VPS13 genes 
(VPS13A/Chorein, VPS13B, VPS13C, and VPS13D; Velayos-Baeza 
et al., 2004). The precise function of these proteins remains un-
clear, although they have been implicated in a variety of processes 
including membrane traffic at Golgi–endosome interfaces (De et 
al., 2017), cytoskeletal organization (Föller et al., 2012; Alesutan et

2015), calcium signaling (Pelzl et al., 2017), mitochondrial health 
(Lesage et al., 2016), and autophagy (Muñoz-Braceras et al., 2015; 
Lupo et al., 2016). Interestingly, stretches of primary sequence 
similarity have been noted between VPS13 and ATG2, another pro-
tein of unknown function that is required for phagophore forma-
tion (Wang et al., 2001; Velikkakath et al., 2012). More specifically, 
similarities occur in the first ∼120 residues at the N terminus 
(referred to as the Chorein_N domain) and in a stretch of ∼70 aa 
in the C-terminal region (termed ATG_C in Pfam; Pfisterer et al., 
2014; Muñoz-Braceras et al., 2015; Tamura et al., 2017).
Human VPS13 proteins are of great biomedical interest as 
loss-of-function mutations in each of them are associated with 
genetic diseases: chorea acanthocytosis, a Huntington-like syn-
drome associated with red cell shape abnormalities (VPS13A; 
Rampoldi et al., 2001; Ueno et al., 2001); Cohen syndrome, a 
complex multisystem condition characterized by global develop-
mental delay and intellectual disability (VPS13B; Kolehmainen 
et al., 2003); an early onset form of Parkinson’s disease (VPS13C; 
Lesage et al., 2016); and a recently described form of ataxia with 
spasticity (VPS13D; Gauthier et al., 2018; Seong et al., 2018). De-
termining the function of these proteins will be key in elucidat-
ing the mechanisms of these diseases.
In this study, we demonstrate that the N-terminal region of 
Vps13 is a lipid transport module that can harbor glycerolipids and 
transfer them between bilayers. We also show that VPS13A, the 
closest homologue of yeast Vps13, localizes at contacts between 
the ER and mitochondria, suggesting that VPS13A may fulfill some 
of the functions of the ERM 
ES complex in mammalian cells. Sur-
prisingly, VPS13C, the paralogue most closely related to VPS13A, is 
instead localized at contacts between the ER and late endosomes/
lysosomes, revealing that duplication of VPS13 during evolution 
correlates with diversification of their sites of action.
Results
VPS13A and VPS13C are localized at organelle contact sites
To gain first insights into the properties of VPS13A, the chorea 
acanthocytosis gene, we investigated its subcellular localization. 
As available antibodies did not detect the protein by immuno-
fluorescence (IF), we tagged it at a site found to preserve yeast 
Vps13 function (Park et al., 2016; VPS13A^Halo or ^mCherry) 
and expressed it in Cos-7 or HeLa cells. By far the majority of the 
VPS13A signal occurred in the form of small patches arranged to 
form elongated structures (Fig. 1 A, left). Coexpression of a mi-
tochondrial marker (mito-BFP) and an ER marker (EGFP-Sec61β) 
identified these structures as mitochondrial profiles lying in 
close proximity to the ER (Fig. 1, A and B; line scans in Fig. 1 C; 
Fig. S1 A; and quantification in Fig. S1 B). Furthermore, in these 
cells, i.e., where VPS13A was overexpressed, areas of close prox-
imity between the ER and mitochondria were increased (Fig. S1 
C). These findings are consistent with an ER-to-mitochondria 
tethering function of VPS13A, consistent with the possibility that 
in metazoa, VPS13A may fulfill some of the functions of ERM 
ES.
In some cells, VPS13A fluorescence signal also appeared in the 
form of small doughnut-shaped spots that overlapped with the 
ER marker (Sec61β; Fig. 1 D, inset a) but not with mitochondria 
(Fig. S1 D). These structures were negative for preinternalized 
dextran (an endocytic tracer; Fig. S1 E) and for markers of the 
endolysosomal system (Fig. S1 F) and were instead identified as 
lipid droplets based on labeling with the neutral lipid marker 
BOD 
IPY 493/503 (Fig. 1 E). Correlative fluorescence EM analy-
sis of VPS13A-transfected cells confirmed that VPS13A fluores-
cent doughnuts were lipid droplets enwrapped by ER tubules 
(Fig. 1 F). EM also showed that contacts between the ER and lipid 
droplets were more abundant in VPS13A-overexpressing cells 
than in WT cells (Fig. S1 G).
Lack of localization of VPS13A on organelles of the endolyso-
somal system was surprising as it contrasted with the localiza-
tion of yeast Vps13 at contact sites between the vacuole and other 
membranes (Lang et al., 2015). We thus asked whether VPS13C, 
a Parkinson’s disease–linked protein and the closest paralogue to 
VPS13A among human VPS13 proteins, was also absent from these 
organelles. VPS13C is similar to VPS13A throughout its length, 
with the exception of the presence of an ∼500-aa insert after 
position 807 most likely corresponding with a duplication of the 
upstream region. When VPS13C^mClover3 (tagged at the cognate 
site used for VPS13A) was coexpressed with VPS13A^mCherry 
in HeLa or Cos-7 cells, striking differences were observed in 
the localization of the two proteins (Figs. 2 A and S2 A). No lo-
calization of VPS13C at mitochondria was observed (Fig. S2 A). 
A major pool of VPS13C was instead localized on vesicular and 
tubular structures negative for VPS13A (Figs. 2 A and S2 A) but 
positive for preinternalized dextran and generally surrounded by 
ER (Fig. 2 B), suggesting that VPS13C populates contacts between 
ER and the endolysosomal system. Some of these vesicles were 
positive for the lysosomal marker LAMP1 (Fig. S2 B) or for Rab7 
(Fig. 2 C), consistent with the reported binding of VPS13C to this 
Rab (McCray et al., 2010). A smaller pool of VPS13C did colocalize 
with VPS13A on doughnut-like structures (Fig. 2 A, arrowheads, 
and Fig. S2 A, arrowheads) that surrounded LipidTOX-stained 
lipid droplets (Fig. 2 D), in agreement with the previously re-
ported association of VPS13C with lipid droplets based on sub-
cellular fractionation (Yang et al., 2016) and IF (Ramseyer et al., 
2018). Lack of VPS13C at mitochondria contacts was unexpected 
as its mutations have been linked to mitochondrial dysfunction 
and Parkinson’s disease (Lesage et al., 2016). However, mitochon-
drial dysfunction could represent an indirect effect of abnormal-
ities in intracellular lipid transport.
Expression of tagged protein yields optimal fluorescence 
signal but may produce artifacts of overexpression. Thus, the 
localization of VPS13A and VPS13C was further validated by im-
munostaining HeLa cells in which the corresponding genes were 
edited to encode proteins with 2×HA epitopes at the same sites 
used to tag the exogenous proteins (Fig. S2 C). The analysis of 
these cells, where VPS13A and VPS13C are expressed at endog-
enous levels, confirmed the differential localization of the two 
proteins at sites of contacts between the ER and mitochondria 
and between the ER and endolysosomes, respectively (Fig. 2, E–H; 
and Fig. S2 D). One difference was that in all cases, only spot-
like contacts between the ER and these other organelles were de-
tected, indicating that the more extensive localization of VPS13A 
and VPS13C at organelle interfaces are due to expansions of these 
contacts as a result of overexpression.

FFAT motifs in VPS13A and VPS13C mediate tethering of the ER
A function of VPS13A and VPS13C in bridging the ER to other or-
ganelles requires the presence of binding sites responsible for 
these localizations. Bioinformatics analysis of VPS13 revealed a 
domain organization conserved from yeast to humans. A long 
N-terminal region of unknown fold (VPS13α) was followed by 
putative WD40 modules, a domain reminiscent of a DH domain 
(DH-Like domain; DHL) and a previously predicted C-terminal 
pleckstrin homology (PH) domain (Fig. 3 A; Fidler et al., 2016). An 
FFAT motif, a short amino acid sequence known to interact with 
the ER VAMP-associated protein (VAP), is present in the Vps13α 
region of both proteins as previously noted (Murphy and Levine, 
2016). Accordingly, full-length VPS13A harboring the FFAT mu-
tation (VPS13AFFLI) was no longer tethered to the ER but rather 
was localized to the entire outer surface of mitochondria and of 
lipid droplets (Fig. S2 E). The same localization was observed for 
WT VPS13A when expressed in VAP-knockout (KO) cells (Fig. S2 
F; Dong et al., 2016). Likewise, N-terminal constructs (VPS13α) of 
both proteins (VPS13A1–1,372 and VPS13C1–1,390) accumulated over 
the entire ER, more so upon cotransfection with VAP (VAPB; Figs. 
3 B and S2 G), while the same constructs harboring mutations 
of the FFAT motif (VPS13A1–1,372FFLI and VPS13C1–1,390YFSL) had a 
diffuse cytosolic distribution (Fig. 3 C). Furthermore, overex-
pression of VAPB together with VPS13C induced the formation of 
abnormal ER structures, completely enwrapping all VPS13C-pos-
itive endosomes (Fig. 3 D). These findings not only confirm the 
role of the FFAT motif in anchoring these proteins to the ER but 
also indicate that binding sites for mitochondria (in VPS13A), late 
endosomes/lysosomes (in VPS13C), and lipid droplets (both pro-
teins) are localized in the C-terminal regions of the two proteins.
C-terminal regions of VPS13A and VPS13C contain binding sites 
for other organelles
A fragment of VPS13A comprising its entire WD40 region had 
a cytosolic distribution (Fig. 4 A), while a corresponding frag-
ment of VPS13C (VPS13C2,415–3,309) fragment decorated the

entire surface of vesicles positive for dextran (Fig. S3 A), Rab7 
(Fig. 4 B), or LAMP1 (Fig. S3 B), thus identifying the WD40 
module as the binding site for late endosomes/lysosomes in 
VPS13C. Further analysis of the localization of deletion con-
structs of VPS13A and VPS13C identified the DHL-PH domains as 
(i) the mitochondria-binding region of VPS13A and (ii) the lipid 
droplet–binding region of both proteins (Fig. 4, C and D). The 
DHL-PH domain sequence contains a region of high similarity to 
ATG2, which also binds lipid droplets (Velikkakath et al., 2012; 
Tamura et al., 2017). Accordingly, this region alone, fused to EGFP, 
labeled lipid droplets (Fig. 4 E). Within this region, an amino acid 
stretch almost identical in VPS13A (aa 2,993–3,027) and VPS13C 
(aa 3,550–3,584) is predicted to fold as an amphipathic helix, 
a structural motif used by some proteins to interact with lipid 
droplets (Rowe et al., 2016). Mutation of one residue (conserved 
between VPS13A and VPS13C) on the hydrophobic face of such 
helix completely abolished its lipid droplet localization (Fig. 4 F). 
An additional amphipathic helix was previously predicted within 
the same region of VPS13A (aa 2,959–2,982; Drin et al., 2007) but 
not in VPS13C and may justify the stronger recruitment on lipid 
droplets observed for VPS13A with respect to VPS13C.
A more precise identification of the mitochondria-binding re-
gion of VPS13A was achieved by generating chimeric constructs 
containing subdomains of the DHL-PH region from VPS13A and 
VPS13C (Fig. S3 C). This demonstrated that both the ATG homol-
ogy region and the PH domain of VPS13A are sufficient to drive 
mitochondrial localization (Fig. S3, D–G), suggesting a bipartite 
binding site. This site resides downstream of the region shown 
to mediate binding to mitochondria in yeast Vps13. However, as 
the yeast mitochondrial Vps13 interactor MCP1 (John Peter et 
al., 2017) is not conserved in mammals, a nonconserved mode of 
binding to mitochondria appears likely.
The N-terminal portion of VPS13 has lipid transport properties
The localization of at least two VPS13 isoforms at organelle con-
tact sites is consistent with a potential conserved role of VPS13 
family proteins in lipid transport between adjacent organelles. 
Thus, we next tested directly the possibility that Vps13 might bind 
and transport lipids. Vps13 is a large protein (molecular weight 
> 340 kD), and so far, we could not produce full-length proteins 
from either humans or other organisms in sufficient quantities 
for biochemical analysis. Thus, we used VPS13 fragments. As 
the predicted WD-40, DHL, and PH domains are unlikely lipid 
transport modules, we focused on the N-terminal region Vps13α 
(Fig. 5 A), whose structure and function were unknown. Not only 
is Vps13α well conserved within the VPS13 family across species, 
but the most N-terminal region (Chorein_N domain) shows ho-
mology with other proteins including ATG2 (De et al., 2017).
We were successful in purifying Vps13α from Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae (residues 1–1,350) and showed by negative-stain EM 
that it forms monomeric or dimeric rods, although the dimeric 
forms may not occur for the full-length protein (Fig. S4, A and B). 
Potential lipid content of this fragment, expressed in Expi293F 
cells and affinity purified, was assessed by liquid chromatogra-
phy–tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). Vps13α bound to 
glycerophospholipids but not other lipid species, with enrich-
ment of PC relative to the glycerolipid content of cellular mem-
branes (Fig. 5 B). Despite rigorous washes of the protein before 
lipid analysis, there were ∼10 glycerolipids associated per protein 
molecule. This indicates that Vps13α might bind multiple lipid 
molecules at once, consistent with studies described below. Fur-
ther supporting that the protein harbors phospholipids, Vps13α 
comigrated with the fluorescently labeled lipids NBD-PS and 
NBD-PA and to a lesser extent with NBD-phosphatidylethan-
loamine (PE) and NBD-ceramide on a native gel (Fig. 5 C).
We used these observations in designing a FRET-based in vitro 
assay to interrogate whether Vps13α can transfer lipids between 
membranes. We mixed donor liposomes containing DGS-NTA,

NBD-PS, and rhodamine-PE with acceptor liposomes containing 
PI(4,5)P2 and lacking fluorescent labeling, and then we added 
Vps13αtethered. In this chimeric construct, the Vps13α fragment 
is tethered to the liposomes via a C-terminal hexahistidine se-
quence that interacts with DGS-NTA on the donor liposomes and 
an upstream N-terminal PH module that interacts with PI(4,5)
P2 on the acceptor liposomes (Figs. 5 D and S5, A and B). Initially, 
FRET between NBD and rhodamine in the donor liposomes 
quenched NBD fluorescence. If either NBD-PS or rhodamine-PE 
or both were transported to acceptor liposomes, the fluorophores 
were diluted, and the distance separating them increased, lead-
ing to decreased FRET and an increase in NBD fluorescence (Figs. 
5 D and S5 A; Struck et al., 1981; Saheki et al., 2016; Yu et al., 2016).
In the transfer assay, NBD fluorescence increased after ad-
dition of Vps13αtethered, consistent with a role for Vps13α in 
lipid transfer. Fluorescence increase was not due to fusion or

thermophilum is indicated. (B) LC/MS/MS analysis of lipids that copurify with Vps13α showed binding to glycerolipids, with a slight preference for PC. Cellular 
abundance of these glycerolipids is indicated (Lees et al., 2017). Sphingomyelin represented 1% of bound lipids. No sterol, di-, or triacylglycerides were detected. 
(C) Vps13α was incubated with NBD-tagged lipid including NBD-ceramide (CM) and then examined by native PAGE. Phospholipids, which were visualized by 
their fluorescence, comigrated with protein, visualized by Coomassie staining. (D) Donor liposomes (25 µM) containing fluorescent lipids (2% NBD-PS, 2% 
NBD-PE, 5% DGS-NTA, 61% DOPC, and 30% PE) were mixed 1:1 with acceptor liposomes (25 µM: 65% DOPC, 30% PE, and 5% PI(4,5)P2) in the presence or 
absence of Vps13αtethered (0.125 µM). This construct tethers the Vps13α fragment between acceptor and donor liposomes via a PI(4,5)P2-specific PH domain and a 
C-terminal hexahistidine sequence. The assay monitors the increase in NBD-PS fluorescence after lipid transfer from donor liposomes, where NBD fluorescence 
is quenched via FRET with Rhodamine-PE, to acceptor liposomes. The fluorescence increase observed is consistent with lipid transfer at a rate similar to that for

hemifusion between donor and acceptor liposomes as the in-
crease in turbidity of the liposome mixture after addition of 
Vps13αtethered (due to the clustering of liposomes induced by this 
construct) was rapidly reversed by the addition of a protease (Fig. 
S5). The fluorescence increase was due to lipid transfer by Vps13 
and not to extraction from donor liposomes only, as in the ab-
sence of acceptor liposomes, i.e., in an extraction-only scenario, 
the assay resulted in a much smaller increase of fluorescence 
(Fig. 5 D). Similar results were obtained by replacing Vps13α in 
the tethering construct with the lipid transport module of Ex-
tended-Synaptotagmin (Schauder et al., 2014; Yu et al., 2016), 
which served as a positive control (Fig. 5 D). Thus, in vitro trans-
fer assays showed that Vps13α can transfer glycerolipids between 
membranes in vitro. Since both the Extended-Synaptotagmins 
and Vps13α bind and thus likely also transport glycerolipids like 
PC and PE (Schauder et al., 2014; see also LC/MS/MS analysis 
above), the major constituents of liposomes in the assay, overall 
lipid transfer by these proteins may be much faster than that ob-
served for fluorescent lipids only.
The N-terminal region of VPS13 contains a hydrophobic cavity
Sequence similarity between the N-terminal regions of VPS13 
and the autophagy protein ATG2 (Pfisterer et al., 2014; De et al., 
2017) hinted that these proteins might share a common module at 
their N termini and guided construct design for structural stud-
ies. After crystallization trials with VPS13 N-terminal fragments 
from various species, we succeeded in crystallizing a fragment 
comprising residues 1–335 (Vps13crystal) from the fungus Cha-
etomium thermophilum, and we solved its structure to a resolu-
tion of 3.0 Å using the single-wavelength anomalous dispersion 
method (Hendrickson, 1991). A poorly conserved, predicted loop 
(residues 228–236) was truncated to facilitate crystallization. 
Data collection and refinement statistics are in Table 1.
Vps13crystal folds to resemble a utility scoop lacking the handle, 
and based on DALI searches of the Protein Database, it bears no 
significant structural similarity to any previously characterized 
protein (Figs. 5 E and S5 C). N-terminal α-helices (α1 and α3) help 
to cap one end of the scoop, whereas loops and the most C-termi-
nal α-helix (α5) define its edges. β-strand elements form the scoop 
base, whose convex backside is buttressed by helix α4. A long pre-
dicted helical segment (α2), which connects strand β4’ to helix α3 
(residues marked by stars in Fig. 5 E) and thus must extend over 
and partially cover the concave face of the scoop, was not ordered 
in the crystal and was not modeled. While the convex backside of 
Vps13crystal is covered by hydrophilic residues, the concave face is 
lined exclusively by hydrophobic residues (Fig. 5 F) and is there-
fore well suited for solubilizing hydrophobic fatty acyl chains of 
phospholipids. The hydrophobic cavity of Vps13crystal, measuring 
∼20 Å across, has approximately twice the diameter of the cavity 
of previously studied lipid transporters and so could accommo-
date several lipid molecules simultaneously.
Indeed, Vps13crystal retains some of the lipid-binding abilities 
of Vps13α (Fig. 5 G). Secondary structure predictions are con-
sistent with the presence of at least two more Vps13crystal-like 
modules in the N-terminal portions of Vps13. To compare the 
number of fluorescent lipids bound by Vps13crystal versus lon-
ger constructs twice or four times its size (Vps131–729 compris-
ing residues 1–729 or Vps131–1,390 comprising residues 1–1,390 
of C. thermophilum Vps13), we used gel-shift experiments as 
described above. We found that Vps131–729 and Vps131–1,390 bind 
approximately twice and 2.5 times as many fluorescent lipids as 
Vps13crystal (Fig. 5 H). Thus, we propose that Vps13crystal is part of 
a larger lipid-binding unit in the intact protein. Full-length Vps13 
could harbor several Vps13crystal-like modules, or alternatively, 
Vps13crystal could be part of an elongated tube reminiscent of lipid 
transporters like ERM 
ES or bacterial lipopolysaccharide trans-
porter complexes (AhYoung et al., 2015; Sherman et al., 2018). 
Vps13crystal could form one end of a tubular structure running 
the length of the Vps13α rod since their diameters match (Fig. S4 
B). The secondary structure predictions for Vps13 are consistent 
with either model (Fig. S6).
Taken together with the lipid harboring data and transfer as-
says, the finding that Vps13α and Vps13crystal harbor a lipid-bind-
ing module or modules supports a lipid-transfer function for 
Vps13. Based on homology with ATG2, our findings raise the pos-
sibility that the N-terminal region of ATG2 may also transfer lip-
ids. Preservation of lipid transfer function does not require high 
sequence conservation beyond that the residues in the cavity be 
hydrophobic and those outside hydrophilic (Fig. S4 C).
Discussion
Collectively, our findings point to VPS13 proteins as lipid trans-
porters at organelle contact sites (Fig. 6). They further indicate 
that as the single Vps13 gene underwent duplications during evo-
lution, specific functions have segregated in different paralogues. 
The robust localization of VPS13A at ER–mitochondria contacts 
is of special interest given the partially overlapping function of 
Vps13 and ERM 
ES in yeast (Lang et al., 2015; Park et al., 2016). As 
a complex homologous to ERM 
ES does not appear to be present 
the lipid transport domain of Extended-Synaptotagmin1 (0.125 µM), a previously validated glycerolipid transporter (Saheki et al., 2016; Yu et al., 2016; Bian et al., 
2018). The Extended-Synaptotagmin1 lipid-transfer domain was tethered between liposomes analagously to Vps13α via a hexahistidine tag and a PH domain. 
The fluorescence increase is much smaller when only donor but not acceptor liposomes are present. The small but still significant fluorescence increase under 
these conditions is due to lipid extraction by Vps13αtethered and would not be expected in the case of Vps13α-mediated fusion of hemifusion between donor 
liposomes. The dithionate and turbidity assays (Fig. S5, A and B) rule out Vps13α-mediated fusion and/or hemifusion between liposomes. The experiments 
were performed in triplicate. SD is indicated. (E) Ribbons diagram for Vps13crystal colored from blue (N terminus) to red (C terminus). Predicted helix α2 (not

bound approximately twice and 2.5× as many fluorescent lipids/protein molecule, respectively. Each experiment was performed in triplicate. SD is indicated.

in metazoans, VPS13A may have taken over its role. As loss of 
VPS13A function results in a neurodegenerative conditions but 
not in embryonic lethality, VPS13A likely cooperates with other 
proteins in lipid transport (Galmes et al., 2016; Hirabayashi et al., 
2017). These may include VPS13B (whose C-terminal region we 
have found in preliminary experiments to bind mitochondria) 
or VPS13D, whose loss results in mitochondrial abnormalities 
(Anding et al., 2018; Seong et al., 2018). The localization of VPS13C 
at contacts of the ER with the endolysosomal system was some-
what unexpected since the study first reporting a causative link 
between VPS13 mutations and Parkinson’s disease also reported 
a partial association of endogenous VPS13C with mitochon-
drial membranes and a role of VPS13 in mitochondrial function 
(Lesage et al., 2016). These findings were in line with strong evi-
dence linking mitochondria defects to Parkinson’s disease (Hang 
et al., 2015). However, mitochondrial dysfunction could be an in-
direct consequence of defects of the endolysosomal system, and 
several recent studies have linked genetic forms of Parkinson’s 
disease to endolysosomal proteins (reviewed in Abeliovich and 
Gitler, 2016). Moreover, the clear association of VPS13C with late 
endosomes/lysosomes shown in this study is consistent with the 
many reported functional connections between VPS13 family 
members and the endolysosomal system in unicellular organisms 
(Samaranayake et al., 2011; Lang et al., 2015; Muñoz-Braceras et 
al., 2015), Drosophila melanogaster (Vonk et al., 2017), and mam-
malian cells (Seifert et al., 2011, 2015). The association with lipid 
droplets, which was previously reported in yeast lacking an ER–
lipid droplet tethering complex (Grippa et al., 2015), raises the 
possibility that VPS13 may help transfer lipids not only between 
membranes but also between these lipid stores and specific 
cellular membranes. It remains possible that the localizations 
reported in this study may be subject to regulation depending 
upon the functional state of the cells as yeast Vps13 localizes at 
different organelle interfaces depending upon growth conditions 
(v-CLA 
MP versus NVJ; Lang et al., 2015).
The atomic structure of Vps13crystal and our in vitro lipid 
transport data indicate that the N-terminal portion of Vps13 
forms a lipid transport domain. While these data were obtained 
with Vps13 from fungi, bioinformatic analysis predicts that the 
structure of Vps13α is conserved through evolution, suggest-
ing preservation of function (Fig. S6). The Vps13crystal fragment 
has no structural similarity to any characterized lipid-trans-
fer module beyond the general feature of a hydrophobic cavity 
that shields lipids from the aqueous environment during their 
transport through the cytosol. The ability of Vps13α to solubilize 
multiple lipids at once is atypical (Wong et al., 2017), though it is 
shared by some lipid transporters in the tubular lipid–binding 
protein (TUL 
IP) family like ERM 
ES (Jeong et al., 2016) or the 
Extended-Synaptotagmins (Schauder et al., 2014). The Chore-
in_N domain has been noted in several other proteins (Pfisterer 
et al., 2014; De et al., 2017) including ATG2, and its presence likely 
indicates that they have lipid transport modules similar to Vps13. 
Indeed, VPS13 and ATG2 may be founding members of a protein 
family with bulk lipid transport properties.
Bulk lipid transfer by VPS13 family members, in addition to 
controlling the lipid homeostasis of different membranes, could 
provide a source of lipids for membrane generation and/or ex-
pansion. For example, yeast Vps13, which associates with the 
spindle pole body component Cdc31 (De et al., 2017), is required 
for the growth of the prospore membrane that nucleates around 
this site (Park and Neiman, 2012; Park et al., 2013). Interestingly,

lipid droplets were shown to form direct contacts with this 
membrane (Hsu et al., 2017). ATG2, which has structural simi-
larities to VPS13 both in its N-terminal and C-terminal (ATG_C) 
region (Pfisterer et al., 2014) and which also binds lipid droplets 
(Velikkakath et al., 2012), is required for an unrelated but similar 
process (Knorr et al., 2012): the maturation/closure of the auto-
phagosome membrane (Velikkakath et al., 2012; Pfisterer et al., 
2014). The most attractive scenario is that ATG2’s still unknown 
mechanism of action in this process may involve transfer of lip-
ids from other membranes and, in cells that contain them, from 
lipid droplets.
A key implication of our study is that defects in lipid dynam-
ics likely play an important role in the clinical manifestations of 
patients with mutations in VPS13 isoforms, which include major 
movement disorders such as chorea acanthocytosis (VPS13A) and 
Parkinson’s disease (VPS13C). They also suggest that different 
properties of each isoform, rather than (or in addition to) their 
different pattern of cell and tissue expression, may explain the 
different manifestations of disrupting mutations in VPS13 iso-
form. An enigmatic feature of the disease resulting from VPS13A 
mutations (chorea and acanthocytosis, i.e., neurodegeneration 
and misshaped erythrocytes) is the abnormal shape of red cells 
(Bird et al., 1978), but it is intriguing that other similar conditions 
are caused by mutations in proteins involved in lipid metabo-
lism (Walsh et al., 2016; Aoun et al., 2017) or organelle tethering 
(Holmes et al., 2001). Addressing the precise function of each iso-
form with loss-of-function studies in cells and intact organisms 
will be a priority of future investigations. It is expected that these 
studies may help shed new insight into pathological mechanisms 
of neurodegenerative conditions.
Materials and methods
Reagents
Halo tag ligands JF549 and JF647 were a kind gift from L. Lavis 
(Janelia Farm, Ashburn, VA). Human VPS13A (transcript variant 
1A) and VPS13C (transcript variant 2A) ORFs were purchased 
from Origene. The following constructs were kind gifts: mito-BFP 
and mCherry-Rab7a from G. Voeltz (University of Colorado Boul-
der, Boulder, CO; 49151 and 61804, respectively; Addgene), GFP-
Rab5a from M. Zerial (Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell 
Biology and Genetics, Dresden, Germany), EGFP-Rab7 from B. 
van Deurs (University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark), 
EGFP-Lamp1 from S. Ferguson (Yale University, New Haven, CT), 
RFP-Lamp1 from W. Mothes (Yale University, New Haven, CT), 
and Sec61b-GFP and RFP from T. Rapoport (Harvard University, 
Cambridge, MA). mCherry-VAPB was previously generated in 
our laboratory (Dong et al., 2016). All the other ORFs used are 
listed in Table S1. Primary antibodies against HA (3F10; Roche), 
VPS13A (NBP1-85641; Novus Biological), VPS13C (HPA043507; 
Sigma-Aldrich Prestige), and GAP 
DH (40-1246; Proteus) were 
purchased commercially. Secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 594–
conjugated goat anti-rat and Alexa Fluor 594–conjugated donkey 
anti-goat) were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific.
All EM reagents were purchased from Electron Microscopy 
Sciences. Lipids were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids: DOPC 
(850357), NBD-PE (810144), NBD-PS (810198), NBD-PA (810138), 
NBD-ceramide (810211), Rhodamine-PE (810150), DGS-NTA 
(Ni; 790404), PI(4,5)P2 (840046), liver PE (840026), and NBD- 
cholesterol (810252).
Bioinformatic analysis
Secondary structure prediction was performed through Dis-
Meta software (Huang et al., 2014), and structure prediction was 
performed through RaptorX (Källberg et al., 2012) and Phyre2 
(Kelley et al., 2015).
Generation of constructs
The coding sequences for Vps13 from C. thermophilum corre-
sponding with residues 1–335 or 1–729 were cloned from genomic 
DNA into a modified pET-Duet vector containing a C-terminal 
6×His tag. The coding sequence corresponding with residues 
1–1,390 was cloned into a pCMV-6 vector containing an N-termi-
nal 3×FLAG tag. The coding sequence for Vps13 from S. cerevisiae 
corresponding with residues 1–1,350, or Vps13α, was amplified 
from genomic DNA and cloned using the same strategy. For 
Vps13αtethered, the same sequence was fused the unstructured 
region of human E-Syt2 (649–739)–His6, with the PH domain 
of rat PLCΔ (11–140) inserted after residue 689 using overlap 
extension PCR, and was cloned into a pCMV-6 vector contain-
ing an N-terminal 3×FLAG tag. E-Syt1 (93–327) containing the 
synaptotagmin, mitochondrial, and lipid-binding protein (SMP) 
lipid transport domain was fused to the PH domain of rat PLCΔ 
(11–140) and cloned into a pET-28a vector containing an N-termi-
nal His6 tag (Bian et al., 2018). Most constructs were generated 
with regular cloning protocols or through site-directed muta-
genesis. Desired ORFs were amplified by PCR and inserted in 
vectors through enzymatic digestion and ligation. Unless other-
wise stated, pmCherry and pEGFP (Takara Bio Inc.) were used as 
cloning vectors. Primer sets, enzymes, and vectors used for each 
construct are displayed in Table S1.
For internal tagging of VPS13A, the EGFP ORF was removed 
from the pEGFP vector through enzymatic digestion (XhoI/NotI), 
and the PCR-amplified VPS13A sequence was ligated. Restric-
tion enzyme sites (SalI/ApaI) were introduced after aa 1,372 via 
site-directed mutagenesis, and mCherry or Halo tag ORFs flanked 
by short linkers (AGG/GG) were then inserted. Mito-GFP and 
mito-mCherry were generated from mito-BFP by swopping the 
fluorescent protein sequence using BamHI/NotI digestion. In-
ternally tagged VPS13C and chimeric constructs were generated 
using InFusion cloning according to the manufacturer’s protocol. 
All ORFs were fully sequenced after cloning.
Protein expression and purification
A fragment of Vps13 from C. thermophilum corresponding with 
residues 1–335 or 1–729 was expressed in BL21 (DE3) Codon Plus 
(Agilent) Escherichia coli cells. Cells were grown at 37°C to an 
OD600 of 0.6–0.8, when protein expression was induced with 
0.5 mM IPTG, and then cells were cultured at 18°C for another 
16–20 h. Selenomethionine-substituted protein was expressed as 
previously described (Doublié, 1997). Cells were pelleted, resus-
pended in buffer A (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.8, 300 mM NaCl, 20 mM 
imidazole, and 5% glycerol) containing 1× complete EDTA-free 
protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) and lysed in an Emulsiflex-C5

cell disruptor (Avestin). Cell lysates were clarified via centrifu-
gation at 27,000 g for 30 min. To collect the protein, supernatant 
was incubated with Ni-NTA resin (QIA 
GEN) for 1 h at 4°C, and 
then the resin was washed with 3× 10 bed volumes of buffer A. 
Retained protein was eluted from the resin with buffer A supple-
mented with 300 mM imidazole, concentrated in a 10-kD molec-
ular weight cutoff (MWCO) Amicon centrifugal filtration device, 
and loaded onto a Superdex 75 16/60 column (GE Healthcare) 
equilibrated with buffer B (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.8, and 150 mM 
NaCl) or buffer C (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.8, 300 mM NaCl, 1 mM 
Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine [TCEP], and 2.5% glycerol) for 
selenomethionine-substituted protein. Peak fractions containing 
pure Vps13 were recovered and concentrated.
Vps131–1,390 (from C. thermophilum), Vps13α, and Vps13αtethered 
(from S. cerevisiae) were each expressed in Expi293 cells (Invit-
rogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions for 72 h. Cells 
were pelleted, resuspended in buffer C, and lysed via sonication. 
Cell lysates were clarified via centrifugation at 27,000 g for 20 
min, and the supernatant was incubated with preequilibrated 
anti-FLAG M2 affinity resin (Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 h. The resin 
was washed with 3× 10 bed volumes of buffer C and incubated 
for 16 h with buffer C containing 1 mM ATP and 2 mM MgCl2. 
The protein was eluted with buffer C supplemented with 0.2 mg/
ml 3× FLAG peptide and concentrated in a 30-kD MWCO Amicon 
centrifugal filtration device.
Protein crystallization, structure 
determination, and refinement
Crystals of selenomethionine-substituted C. thermophilum 
Vps13 (1–335 Δ228–236)–His6 at 6 mg/ml were grown at 37°C 
using the sitting-drop vapor-diffusion method. Equal volumes 
of protein were mixed with mother liquor containing 100 mM 
Bis-Tris, pH 6.5–6.7, and 34–38% 15/4 pentaerythritol ethoxylate 
(Hampton). Drops were equilibrated against well solution con-
taining 1 M NaCl. Crystals, which belonged to spacegroup P21 
and had two copies of Vps13crystal in the asymmetric unit, were 
harvested in cryoloops and flash frozen. Diffraction data were 
collected at NE-CAT beamline 24-ID-C at the Advanced Photon 
Source and integrated, scaled, and merged using X-ray Detector 
Software and Aimless (Kabsch, 2010; Evans, 2011). Data from four 
crystals collected at the selenium edge were combined in the final 
dataset, and phases were calculated using the single-wavelength 
anomalous dispersion method (Hendrickson, 1991). We identi-
fied the selenium positions, calculated experimental phases and 
density-modified maps, and built an initial model using the phe-
nix AutoSol pipeline (Adams et al., 2010). Because diffraction was 
anisotropic, completeness dropped abruptly at resolutions better 
than 3 Å, and maps calculated at higher resolutions showed no 
improvement. Accordingly, the final model was refined to a res-
olution of 3.0 Å by multiple cycles of manual model rebuilding 
in coot (Emsley et al., 2010) followed by positional, individual 
isotropic B-factor and Translation Libration Screw refinement 
with phenix.refine (Adams et al., 2010) using secondary struc-
ture restraints. We modeled residues 2–228, 231–240, and 247–317 
(numbering refers to the loop-deleted sequence) in one of the 
Vps13crystal copies; some of these residues were disordered in 
the second copy (2–5, 19–22, 30–33, 221–226, and 240–247) and 
were omitted from the model. Figures were made using PyMOL 
(v1.8.6.0) software.
Lipid analysis of Vps13 by mass spectrometry
S. cerevisiae Vps13α (aa 1–1,350) was expressed and purified as 
described above with the following modifications. Following im-
munoprecipitation, FLAG resin–bound Vps13α was washed with 
3× 20 bed volumes of buffer C for 30 min, after which it was incu-
bated for 16 h with buffer containing 1 mM ATP and 2 mM MgCl2. 
The protein was eluted with buffer supplemented with 0.2 mg/
ml 3× FLAG peptide and concentrated in a 30-kD MWCO Amicon 
centrifugal filtration device to ∼0.5 mg/ml final concentration. 
The purified protein sample was sent to Avanti Polar Lipids for 
lipid analysis, where bound lipids were extracted in 2:1 (vol/vol) 
methanol: 
choroform. The chloroform layer was dried, and lipids 
were reconstituted with internal standards for phosphatidyl-
choline (PC), PE, phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidylserine 
(PS), phosphatidic acid (PA), phosphatidylglycerol (PG), sphin-
gomyelin (SM), triacylglycerol (TAG), DAG, and cholesterol-d7 for 
quantitation. The sample was injected into a reversed-phase C8 
column with a gradient elution profile for the resolution of each 
lipid class and detected by an AB Sciex 5500 tandem mass spec-
trometer. The molecular species of lipids was quantified based 
on internal standards and summed by lipid class.
Liposome preparation
To prepare liposomes for lipid-transfer assays, lipids in chloro-
form were mixed in the indicated ratios and dried to thin films. 
Lipids were subsequently reconstituted in buffer containing 
20 mM Hepes, pH 7.8, 300 mM NaCl, and 5% glycerol at a total 
lipid concentration of 1 mM and subjected to 10 freeze–thaw 
cycles alternating between liquid nitrogen and 37°C water bath. 
Crude liposomes were then extruded through a polycarbonate 
filter with 100 nm pore size a total of 21 times via a mini extruder 
(Avanti Polar Lipids) and used within 24 h.
In vitro lipid-binding assay
1 µl of either NBD-labeled PE, PS, PA, cholesterol, or ceramide (1 
mg/ml in methanol) was incubated with 19 µl purified Vps13α or 
Vps13crystal (2 mg/ml) for either 30 min at 37°C or 2 h at 4°C. Sam-
ples were visualized on 10% native PAGE gels. NBD fluorescence 
was visualized using an ImageQuant LAS4000 (GE Healthcare), 
and total protein was visualized with Coomassie staining.
In vitro lipid-transfer FRET assays
Lipid-transfer reactions were performed in 50-µl volumes in 
96-well plates (Nunc) containing a protein: 
lipid ratio of 1:400, 
with 0.125 µM protein, 25 µM donor liposomes (61% DOPC, 30% 
liver PE, 2% NBD-PS, 2% Rhodamine-PE, and 5% DGS-NTA [Ni]) 
and 25 µM acceptor liposomes (65% DOPC, 30% liver PE, and 5% 
PI(4,5P)2). Fluorescence intensity of NBD was measured via ex-
citation at 460 nm and detection at 538 nm every 1 min for 30 
min at 30°C using a Synergy H1 Plate Reader (BioTek). All data 
were corrected by subtracting baseline from no-protein controls.
For the liposome fusion–control assay, we used the dithionite 
assay as previously described (Weber et al., 1998; Shi et al., 2013). 
Briefly, after performing a lipid-transfer reaction (as described 
 Kumar et al. 
VPS13 proteins transfer lipids at membrane contact sites

above), 2.5 µl freshly prepared dithionite buffer (100 mM dithion-
ite [Sigma-Aldrich] in 50 mM Tris, pH 10) was added to reactions, 
and NBD fluorescence was monitored for an additional 20 min.
The turbidity assay, which rules out fusion and hemifusion, 
was performed as previously described (Bian et al., 2018). We 
used the same constructs and concentration of proteins and 
liposomes in the same volume as for the lipid-transfer assay. 
Following addition of the protein to the liposomes, absorbance 
at 405 nm was measured every 30 s for 10 min; then, cocktail 
(10 µl) containing 1.8 M imidazole and 1.15 mg/ml proteinase 
K (Sigma-Aldrich) was added, and absorbance was monitored 
for an additional 10 min. All data were corrected by subtracting 
background signal before protein addition.
Cell culture and transfection
HeLa and Cos-7 cells (obtained from ATCC) were maintained at 
37°C in a humidified atmosphere at 5% of CO2 in DMEM (Thermo 
Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 10% FBS (Thermo Fisher 
Scientific), 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, and 
2 mM GlutaMAX (Thermo Fisher Scientific). EXPI293 were 
grown in EXPI293 expression medium upon constant shaking. 
All cell lines were routinely tested and always resulted as free 
from mycoplasma contamination.
Generation of 2×HA-tagged VPS13A and VPS13C CRI 
SPR–
knock-in HeLa cell line
For the insertion of a 2×HA tag in the endogenous locus of either 
VPS13A or VPS13C in HeLa cells, asymmetric single-stranded 
DNA (ssDNA) donor repair templates designed as described by 
Richardson et al. (2016) were used. Cas9-mediated cut was di-
rected by single-guide RNA obtained by mixing a fluorescent tra-
crRNA ATTO 550 (IDT) and a specific CRI 
SPR RNA (crRNA; see 
Table S1). Ribonuclear complexes were obtained by incubating 
the two RNA components with the purified Cas9 (IDT) and the 
donor ssDNA (see Table S1) and then transfected into low-pas-
sage HeLa cells using Mirus TransIT-X2 transfection reagent. 
24 h after transfection, cells containing the fluorescent tracrRNA 
were selected by FACS sorting, and single positive cells were 
seeded in 96-well plates. Single clones were allowed to grow and 
then were tested for HA expression by Western blotting. Positive 
clones were used for subsequent IF.
As expected for such large proteins (>360 kD), the endog-
enous levels of expression are so low that a conventional IF 
protocol with rat anti-HA primary antibody (MBL) followed by 
Alexa Fluor 594–conjugated goat anti-rat secondary antibody 
did not produce a signal strong enough to be detected by mi-
croscopy. To amplify the signal, an additional incubation with a 
tertiary Alexa Fluor 594–conjugated donkey anti-goat antibody 
was used. Moreover, to improve the signal-to-noise ratio, each 
of the antibodies used was subjected to a clearing procedure as 
follows: WT HeLa cells were fixed in 4% PFA, washed in 50 mM 
glycine in PBS, double-rinsed in PBS, and then scraped in PBS 
containing 1% BSA and 1% Triton X-100. Antibodies were added 
to the fixed cell lysate at a concentration 3.5× higher than the 
final concentration used for IF and were incubated by rotation 
on a wheel overnight at 4°C. Cell debris were then pelleted by 
spinning the tubes at 17,000 g for 20 min at 4°C, and the super-
natant containing cleared antibodies was diluted 3.5× in PBS 
containing 1% BSA.
Fixed- and live-cell imaging
For microscopy, cells were seeded on glass-bottomed Mat-Tek 
dishes (Mat-Tek Corporation) 5,500/cm2 in complete media 
without antibiotics and transfected 16 h later with FugeneHD 
(Promega). Spinning-disk confocal imaging was performed 
20–24 h after transfection using a Nikon Ti-E inverted micro-
scope equipped with the Improvision UltraView VoX system 
(PerkinElmer) and controlled by Volocity (Improvision) soft-
ware. Images were acquired with a Plan Apochromat objective 
(60× 1.45 NA). During imaging, cells were maintained in live-cell 
imaging buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in a humidified at-
mosphere at 37°C.
Halo tag ligands JF549 and JF647 were used at a final con-
centration of 200 nM. Cells were incubated with the dye for 1 h, 
rinsed, and then incubated in complete media for 1 h before imag-
ing. For dextran internalization, cells were incubated with 10 µg/
ml dextran–Alexa Fluor 488 or dextran–Alexa Fluor 647 (3,000 
molecular weight; Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 30 min or over-
night in complete culture media. Live staining of lipid droplets 
with BOD 
IPY 493/503 (Sigma-Aldrich) was performed in com-
plete media (final concentration of 1 µM) for 20 min at 37°C fol-
lowed by a 10-min wash in complete media right before imaging. 
For staining of lipid droplets with LipidTox reagent (Thermo 
Fisher Scientific) in fixed cells, cells were fixed in freshly pre-
pared PFA (4% in phosphate buffer, pH 7.5) for 20 min at room 
temperature and then washed in PBS. PBS-diluted LipidTox re-
agent was added to cells following manufacturer’s instructions.
Correlative fluorescence and EM microscopy
Cells were seeded on gridded glass-bottomed Mat-Tek dishes and 
transfected with VPS13A^mCherry and GFP-Sec61β as described 
above. Cells expressing VPS13A and showing doughnut-shaped 
structures positive for both VPS13A and the ER marker were 
identified with the spinning-disk microscope (see above for 
settings) and localized on the grid using the transmitted light 
channel. Cells were then fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde–0.1 M so-
dium cacodylate and post-fixed with 1% OsO4 in 1.5% K4Fe(CN)6 
and 0.1 M sodium cacodylate, followed by en bloc staining with 
2% uranyl acetate, dehydration in ethanol, and embedding in 
Embed 812. Using the grid as a guide, the selected cells were 
identified under a light microscope and then cut and contrasted 
with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Samples were imaged with a 
Philips CM-10 transmission electron microscope. ER–lipid drop-
let contact sites (defined as region of <20 nm distance between 
membranes) were counted and measured in length using iTEM 
software (Olympus).
Image processing, analysis, and statistics
Florescence images presented are representative of cells im-
aged in at least three independent experiments and were pro-
cessed with FIJI (ImageJ; National Institutes of Health) software. 
Unsharp Mask and Gaussian blur filters were applied on some 
of the images presented, and the dimension of higher-magni-
fication insets were doubled using the Scale function of FIJI.

Quantifications were performed on unprocessed single-plane 
ROIs of 400 µm2 obtained from at least three independent exper-
iments. Area of overlap between VPS13A signal and ER or mito-
chondria were obtained by generating a mask of the thresholded 
signal from Sec61β or mito-BFP channels, respectively, and then 
adding this mask on the thresholded VPS13A channel. The per-
centage of VPS13A signal within the mask over the total thresh-
olded VPS13A signal area was then calculated. ER–mitochondria 
contacts were quantified with an analogous approach, generat-
ing a mask of the thresholded mito-BFP channel and calculat-
ing the percentage of the thresholded Sec61β-positive area that 
overlaps with that mask. Quantification of the area of overlap 
between endogenous VPS13A-HA or VPS13C-HA signal with mi-
tochondria or late endosomes was performed by making a mask 
of the thresholded signal from Mito-GFP or EGFP-Rab7 signal and 
adding this mask on the thresholded HA channel. The percent-
age of HA signal within the mask over the total thresholded HA 
signal area was then quantified on a per-cell basis. Comparisons 
between conditions were conducted using one-way ANO 
VA fol-
lowed by Tukey’s honest significant difference test using Graph-
Pad Prism software.
For the evaluation of ER–lipid droplet contacts in EM images, 
three cells per condition from two independent experiments 
were analyzed. For each cell, a single section of the middle plane 
of the cell was used. Statistical analysis was performed with 
Prism. Groups were compared using a two-tailed Student’s t test, 
and results were deemed significant when P > 0.05.
