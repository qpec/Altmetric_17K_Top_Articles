Abstract
Problem/Condition: Since 1969, CDC has conducted abortion surveillance to document the number and characteristics of 
women obtaining legal induced abortions in the United States.
Period Covered: 2013.
Description of System: Each year, CDC requests abortion data from the central health agencies of 52 reporting areas (the 50 states, 
the District of Columbia, and New York City). The reporting areas provide this information voluntarily. For 2013, data were 
received from 49 reporting areas. For trend analysis, abortion data were evaluated from 47 areas that reported data every year 
during 2004–2013. Census and natality data, respectively, were used to calculate abortion rates (number of abortions per 1,000 
women) and ratios (number of abortions per 1,000 live births).
Results: A total of 664,435 abortions were reported to CDC for 2013. Of these abortions, 98.2% were from the 47 reporting 
areas that provided data every year during 2004–2013. Among these 47 reporting areas, the abortion rate for 2013 was 12.5 
abortions per 1,000 women aged 15–44 years, and the abortion ratio was 200 abortions per 1,000 live births. From 2012 to 
2013, the total number, rate, and ratio of reported abortions decreased 5%. From 2004 to 2013, the total number, rate, and ratio 
of reported abortions decreased 20%, 21%, and 17%, respectively. In 2013, all three measures reached their lowest level for the 
entire period of analysis (2004–2013).
In 2013 and throughout the period of analysis, women in their 20s accounted for the majority of abortions and had the highest 
abortion rates; women in their 30s and older accounted for a much smaller percentage of abortions and had lower abortion rates. 
In 2013, women aged 20–24 and 25–29 years accounted for 32.7% and 25.9% of all abortions, respectively, and had abortion 
rates of 21.8 and 18.2 abortions per 1,000 women aged 20–24 and 25–29 years, respectively. In contrast, women aged 30–34, 
35–39, and ≥40 years accounted for 16.8%, 9.2%, and 3.6% of all abortions, respectively, and had abortion rates of 11.8, 7.0, 
and 2.5 abortions per 1,000 women aged 30–34 years, 35–39 years, and ≥40 years, respectively. During 2004–2013, the decrease 
in abortion rates among adult women aged 20–39 years ranged from 8% to 27% across these age groups, whereas the abortion 
rate was stable for women aged ≥40 years.
In 2013, adolescents aged <15 and 15–19 years accounted for 0.3% and 11.4% of all abortions, respectively, and had abortion 
rates of 0.6 and 8.2 abortions per 1,000 adolescents aged <15 and 15–19 years, respectively. From 2004 to 2013, the percentage 
of abortions accounted for by adolescents aged 15–19 years decreased 31% and their abortion rate decreased 46%. These decreases 
were greater than the decreases for women in any older age group.
In contrast to the percentage distribution of abortions and abortion rates by age, abortion ratios in 2013 and throughout the 
entire period of analysis were highest among adolescents and lowest among women aged 30–39 years. Abortion ratios decreased 
from 2004 to 2013 for women in all age groups, except for adolescents aged <15 years.
In 2013, the majority (66.0%) of abortions were performed by ≤8 weeks’ gestation, and nearly all (91.6%) were performed by 
≤13 weeks’ gestation. Few abortions were performed between 14 and 20 weeks’ gestation (7.1%) or at ≥21 weeks’ gestation (1.3%). 
From 2004 to 2013, the percentage of all abortions performed at ≤13 weeks’ gestation remained consistently high (≥91.5%) and 
among those performed at ≤13 weeks’ gestation, the percentage 
performed at ≤6 weeks’ gestation increased 16%.
In 2013, among the 43 reporting areas that included medical 
(nonsurgical) abortion on their reporting form, a total of 
67.9% of abortions were performed by curettage at ≤13 weeks’

Introduction
This report summarizes abortion data for 2013 that were 
provided voluntarily to CDC by the central health agencies 
of 49 reporting areas (the District of Columbia; New York 
City; and 47 states, excluding California, Maryland, and New 
Hampshire). Data were obtained every year during 2004–2013 
from 47 reporting areas (excluding California, Louisiana, 
Maryland, New Hampshire, and West Virginia) and were used 
for trend analyses. Since 1969, CDC has conducted abortion 
surveillance to document the number and characteristics 
of women obtaining legal induced abortions in the United 
States (1). Following nationwide legalization of abortion in 
1973, the total number, rate (number of abortions per 1,000 
women aged 15–44 years), and ratio (number of abortions 
per 1,000 live births) of reported abortions increased rapidly, 
reaching the highest levels in the 1980s before decreasing at a 
slow yet steady pace (2–4). However, the incidence of abortion 
has varied considerably across demographic subpopulations 
(5–10). Moreover, during 2006–2008, a break occurred in 
the previously sustained pattern of decrease (11–14), although 
this break has been followed in all subsequent years by even 
greater decreases (15–19). Continued surveillance is needed 
to monitor long-term changes in the incidence of abortion in 
the United States.
Methods
Description of the Surveillance System
Each year, CDC requests tabulated data from the central 
health agencies of 52 reporting areas (the 50 states, the District 
of Columbia, and New York City) to document the number and 
characteristics of women obtaining legal induced abortions in the 
United States. For the purpose of surveillance, a legal induced 
abortion* is defined as an intervention performed within the 
limits of state law by a licensed clinician (e.g., a physician, 
nurse-midwife, nurse practitioner, or physician assistant) that 
is intended to terminate a suspected or known intrauterine 
pregnancy that is ongoing and produce a nonviable fetus.
In most states, collection of abortion data is facilitated by 
the legal requirement for hospitals, facilities, and physicians 
to report all abortions to a central health agency (20). These 
central health agencies then voluntarily report the abortion 
data they have collected through their independent surveillance 
systems and provide only aggregate numbers to CDC (21). 
Although reporting to CDC is voluntary, most reporting 
areas provide their aggregate abortion numbers. During 
2004–2013, a total of 47 reporting areas provided CDC a 
continuous annual record of abortion numbers† and in 2013, 
CDC obtained aggregate abortion numbers from 49 reporting 
areas (excludes California, Maryland, and New Hampshire).
Although CDC obtains aggregate abortion numbers from 
most of the central health agencies, the level of detail that it 
receives on the characteristics of women obtaining abortions 
varies considerably from year to year and by reporting area. To 
encourage more uniform collection of these details, CDC has 
collaborated with the National Association of Public Health 
Statistics and Information Systems to develop reporting 
standards and provide technical guidance for vital statistics 
personnel who collect and summarize abortion data within the 
gestation, 22.2% were performed by early medical abortion (a nonsurgical abortion at ≤8 weeks’ gestation), and 8.6% were 
performed by curettage at >13 weeks’ gestation; all other methods were uncommon. Among abortions performed at ≤8 weeks’ 
gestation that were eligible for early medical abortion on the basis of gestational age, 32.8% were completed by this method. From 
2012 to 2013, the percentage of abortions reported as early medical abortions increased 5%.
Deaths of women associated with complications from abortion for 2013 are being investigated as part of CDC’s Pregnancy 
Mortality Surveillance System. In 2012, the most recent year for which data were available, four women were identified to have 
died as a result of complications from known legal induced abortion. No reported deaths were associated with known illegal 
induced abortion.
Interpretation: Among the 47 areas that reported data every year during 2004–2013, the decreases in the total number, rate, 
and ratio of reported abortions that occurred during 2009–2012 continued from 2012 to 2013, resulting in historic lows for all 
three measures of abortion.
Public Health Action: The data in this report can help program planners and policymakers identify groups of women with highest 
rates of abortion. Unintended pregnancy is the major contributor to abortion. Increasing access to and use of contraception, 
including the most effective methods, can reduce unintended pregnancies and further reduce the number of abortions performed 
in the United States.
* Hereafter, all abortions in this report are considered to be legally induced unless 
stated to be illegally induced.
† Data were not reported for ≥1 year by California (2004–2013), Louisiana (2005), 
Maryland (2007–2013), New Hampshire (2004–2013), and West Virginia (2004).

United States. However, because the collection and reporting of 
abortion data are not federally mandated, many reporting areas 
have developed their own data collection forms and therefore 
do not collect or provide all the information or level of detail 
included in this report.
Variables and Categorization of Data
Each year, CDC sends suggested templates to the central 
health agencies for compilation of abortion data in aggregate. 
Aggregate abortion numbers, without individual-level records, 
are requested for the following variables:
• Maternal age in years (<15, 15–19 by individual year, 
20–24, 25–29, 30–34, 35–39, or ≥40)
• Gestational age in weeks at the time of abortion (≤6, 7–20 
by individual week, or ≥21)
• Race (black, white, or other [including Asian, Pacific 
Islander, other races, and multiple races])
• Ethnicity (Hispanic or non-Hispanic)
• Method type (curettage,§ intrauterine instillation, medical 
[nonsurgical] abortion, or hysterectomy/hysterotomy)
• Marital status (married [including currently married or 
separated] or unmarried [including never married, 
widowed, or divorced])
• Number of previous live births (0, 1, 2, 3, or ≥4)
• Number of previous abortions (0, 1, 2, or ≥3)
• Maternal residence (the state, reporting area, territory, or 
foreign country in which the woman obtaining the 
abortion lived; or, if additional details are unavailable, 
in-reporting area versus out-of-reporting area)
In addition to sending templates for compiling information 
on race and ethnicity as separate variables, since 2001 CDC has 
provided alternative templates for the tabulation of aggregate 
cross-classified race/ethnicity data. Before 2007, few reporting 
areas returned these alternative templates; results by these 
cross-classified race/ethnicity categories (non-Hispanic white, 
non-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic other, and Hispanic) are 
thus shown only for 2007–2013.
Finally, both the original and alternative templates provided 
by CDC request that aggregate numbers for certain variables 
be cross-tabulated by a second variable. These cross-tabulations 
include gestational age (separately by maternal age, by method 
type, by race, by ethnicity, and by race/ethnicity) and maternal 
age and marital status (separately by race, by ethnicity, and by 
race/ethnicity).
In this report, medical abortions and abortions performed 
by curettage are further categorized by gestational age. For 
medical abortion, early medical abortion is defined as the 
administration of medication or medications (typically 
mifepristone followed by misoprostol) to induce an abortion 
at ≤8 weeks’ gestation¶; medical abortion at >8 weeks’ gestation 
is defined as the administration of medication or medications 
(typically vaginal prostaglandins) to induce an abortion at 
>8 weeks’ gestation. For curettage, abortions are categorized as 
having been performed at ≤13 weeks’ gestation or at >13 weeks’ 
gestation because of differences in technique used before and 
after 13 weeks (23). Finally, because intrauterine instillations 
cannot be performed early in gestation, abortions reported to 
have been performed by intrauterine instillation at ≤12 weeks’ 
gestation are excluded from calculation of the percentage of 
abortions by known method type.**
Measures of Abortion
Four measures of abortion are presented in this report: 
1) the total number of abortions in a given population, 
2) the percentage of abortions obtained by women in a given 
population, 3) the abortion rate (number of abortions per 1,000 
women aged 15–44 years or other specific group within a given 
population), and 4) the abortion ratio (number of abortions 
per 1,000 live births within a given population). Although 
total numbers and percentages are useful for determining 
how many women have obtained an abortion, abortion rates 
adjust for differences in population size and reflect how likely 
abortion is among women in particular groups. Abortion ratios 
measure the relative number of pregnancies in a population 
that end in abortion compared with live birth. Abortion 
ratios are influenced both by the proportion of pregnancies 
in a population that are unintended and the proportion of 
unintended pregnancies that end in abortion. Abortion ratios 
also are influenced by the proportion of intended pregnancies 
that end in abortion; however, intended pregnancies account 
for a very small percentage of abortions (<5%) (26).
U.S. Census Bureau estimates of the resident female 
population of the United States, compiled by CDC, were used 
as the denominator for calculating abortion rates (27–36). 
Overall abortion rates were calculated from the population 
of women aged 15–44 years living in the reporting areas that 
§ Includes aspiration curettage, suction curettage, manual vacuum aspiration, 
menstrual extraction, sharp curettage, and dilation and evacuation procedures.
 ¶ CDC collects information only on the estimated number of weeks (not days) 
of gestation and acknowledges the conventional use of completed weeks of 
gestation to describe pregnancy duration. CDC’s category ≤8 weeks’ gestation 
thus includes abortions up through 8 weeks and 6 days, which closely 
corresponds to the gestational age limit of 63 days for the early medical abortion 
protocol that was endorsed by the American College of Obstetricians and 
Gynecologists for the year encompassed by this surveillance report (22).
 
** The cutoff of ≤12 weeks has been selected on the basis of the implausibility 
of this procedure being performed at earlier gestational ages and on the basis 
of early research assessing the safety of intrauterine instillations starting at 
13 weeks’ gestation (24,25).

MMWR / November 25, 2016 / Vol. 65 / No. 12
provided data. For adolescents aged <15 years, abortion rates 
were determined on the basis of the number of adolescents aged 
13–14 years; similarly, for women aged ≥40 years, abortion 
rates were determined on the basis of the number of women 
aged 40–44 years. For the calculation of abortion ratios, live 
birth data were obtained from CDC natality files (37) and 
included births to women of all ages living in the reporting 
areas that provided abortion data.
Data Presentation and Analysis
This report provides state-specific and overall abortion 
numbers, rates, and ratios for the 49 areas that reported 
to CDC for 2013 (excludes California, Maryland, and 
New Hampshire). In addition, this report describes the 
characteristics of women who obtained abortions in 2013. 
Because the completeness of reporting on the characteristics 
of women varies by year and by variable, this report only 
describes the characteristics of women obtaining abortions 
in areas that met reporting standards (i.e., reported at least 
20 abortions overall, provided data categorized in accordance 
with surveillance variables, and had <15% unknown values for 
a given characteristic). Cells with a value in the range of 1–4 
have been suppressed to maintain confidentiality. In addition, 
abortion rates and ratios have been omitted for groups with 
<20 abortions because results are considered unstable (38).
Although most of the data are presented by the reporting 
area in which the abortions were performed, 48 reporting areas 
in 2013 also provided the number of abortions by maternal 
residence.†† However, two of these reporting areas (Illinois 
and Wisconsin) reported certain characteristics for in-state 
residents but not for out-of-state residents. Three other 
reporting areas (Iowa, Louisiana, and Massachusetts) provided 
only the total number of abortions for out-of-state residents 
without specifying individual states or areas of residence from 
which these women came. As a result, abortion statistics in this 
report by area of residence should be interpreted with caution 
and might underestimate abortions, especially for reporting 
areas from which many women travel to other states to obtain 
abortion services.
To evaluate overall trends in the number, rate, and ratio of 
reported abortions, annual data are presented for the 47 areas 
that reported every year during 2004–2013. Linear regression 
analysis was used to assess the overall rate of change among 
these areas during the entire 10-year period of analysis (2004–
2013) and during the first and second halves of the period of 
analysis (2004–2008 and 2009–2013). The percentage change 
in abortion measures from the most recent past year (2012 
to 2013) and from the beginning to the end of the 10-year 
period of analysis (2004 to 2013) also were calculated for these 
same 47 areas.
For the analysis of certain additional variables (i.e., abortions 
by maternal age and gestational age), annual data are presented 
for areas that met reporting standards every year during 
2004–2013; the percentage change was calculated from the 
beginning to the end of the 10-year period of analysis (2004 
to 2013), from the first and second halves of this period (2004 
to 2008 and 2009 to 2013), and from the most recent past 
year (2012 to 2013). For other variables (i.e., race/ethnicity, 
method for performing an abortion, marital status, number 
of previous abortions, and number of previous live births), 
annual data are not presented; areas were included if they met 
reporting standards for the years needed for percentage change 
calculations. To evaluate trends in the use of different methods 
for performing an abortion, reporting areas were included only 
if they met reporting standards and if they specifically included 
medical abortion as a method on their reporting form.
Some of the 49 areas that reported for 2013 are not included 
in certain trend analyses. As a result, summary measures for 
comparisons over time might differ slightly from the point 
estimates presented for all areas that reported for 2013.
Abortion Mortality
CDC has reported data on abortion-related deaths 
periodically since information on abortion mortality first was 
included in the 1972 abortion surveillance report (19,39). 
An abortion-related death is defined as a death resulting 
from a direct complication of an abortion (legal or illegal), 
an indirect complication caused by a chain of events initiated 
by an abortion, or an aggravation of a pre-existing condition 
by the physiologic or psychologic effects of abortion (40). All 
deaths determined to be related causally to induced abortion 
are classified as abortion related regardless of the time between 
the abortion and death. In addition, any pregnancy-related 
death in which the pregnancy outcome was induced abortion 
regardless of the causal relation between the abortion and the 
death is considered an abortion-related death. An abortion is 
defined as legal only if it is performed by a licensed clinician 
within the limits of state law.
Since 1987, CDC has monitored abortion-related deaths 
through its Pregnancy Mortality Surveillance System (41,42). 
Sources of data for abortion-related deaths have included state 
vital records; media reports, including computerized searches 
of full-text newspaper and other print media databases; and 
individual case reports by public health agencies, including 
maternal mortality review committees, health care providers 
 
†† Excludes four reporting areas that did not report or did not report by maternal 
residence (California, Florida, Maryland, and New Hampshire).

and provider organizations, private citizens, and citizen 
groups. For each death that possibly is related to abortion, 
CDC requests clinical records and autopsy reports. Two 
medical epidemiologists independently review these reports 
to determine the cause of death and whether the death was 
abortion related. Discrepancies are discussed and resolved by 
consensus. Each death is categorized by abortion type as legal 
induced, illegal induced, spontaneous, or unknown type.
This report provides data from the Pregnancy Mortality 
Surveillance System on induced abortion-related deaths 
that occurred in 2012, the most recent year for which data 
are available. Data on induced abortion-related deaths that 
occurred during 1972–2011 already have been published 
(19), and possible abortion-related deaths that occurred 
during 2013–2016 are under investigation. For 1998–2012, 
abortion surveillance data reported to CDC cannot be used 
alone to calculate national case-fatality rates (number of legal 
induced abortion-related deaths per 100,000 reported legal 
induced abortions in the United States) because certain states§§ 
did not report abortion data every year during this period. 
Thus, national legal induced abortion case-fatality rates were 
calculated with denominator data from a more complete 
source on the total number of abortions performed in the 
United States (15). Because rates determined on the basis of 
a numerator of <20 deaths are highly variable (38), national 
legal induced abortion case-fatality rates were calculated for 
consecutive 5-year periods during 1973–2012.
Results
U.S. Totals
Among the 49 reporting areas that provided data for 2013, a 
total of 664,435 abortions were reported. Of these abortions, 
652,582 (98.2%) were obtained from the 47 reporting areas 
that provided data every year during 2004–2013.¶¶ These 
same 47 areas had an abortion rate of 12.5 abortions per 
1,000 women aged 15–44 years and an abortion ratio of 200 
abortions per 1,000 live births (Table 1). For all three measures 
of abortion, large decreases resulted in the lowest levels reported 
during the entire period of analysis. From 2012 to 2013, a 5% 
decrease occurred in the total number of reported abortions 
(from 688,149), the abortion rate (from 13.2 abortions per 
1,000 women aged 15–44 years), and the abortion ratio (from 
210 abortions per 1,000 live births). From 2004 to 2013, 
among the same 47 areas that reported every year during 
this period, the total number of reported abortions decreased 
20% (from 817,906), the abortion rate decreased 21% (from 
15.9 abortions per 1,000 women aged 15–44 years), and the 
abortion ratio decreased 17% (from 241 abortions per 1,000 
live births) (Figure 1). Among these same 47 areas, the annual 
rate of decrease fitted from the regression analysis was greater 
during 2009–2013 than during 2004–2008 for all three 
measures of abortion. During 2009–2013, the number of 
reported abortions decreased by 32,002 abortions per year, the 
abortion rate decreased by 0.64 abortions per 1,000 women 
per year, and the abortion ratio decreased by 7.1 abortions 
per 1,000 live births per year. In contrast, during 2004–2008, 
the number of reported abortions increased by 896 abortions 
per year, the abortion rate decreased by 0.01 abortions per 
1,000 women per year, and the abortion ratio decreased by 
2.5 abortions per 1,000 live births per year.
Occurrence and Residence
Abortion numbers, rates, and ratios for 2013 have been 
calculated by reporting area of occurrence and the residence 
of the women who obtained the abortions (Table 2). By 
occurrence, a considerable range existed in the abortion rate 
(from 3.6 abortions per 1,000 women aged 15–44 years 
in Mississippi to 24.3 abortions per 1,000 women in New 
York [city and state combined]) and the abortion ratio (from 
49 abortions per 1,000 live births in South Dakota to 414 
abortions per 1,000 live births in New York [city and state 
combined]).*** Similarly, a considerable range existed by 
residence††† in the abortion rate (from 4.7 abortions per 
1,000 women aged 15–44 years in South Dakota to 23.6 
abortions per 1,000 women aged 15–44 years in New York 
[city and state combined]) and the abortion ratio (from 60 
abortions per 1,000 live births in Utah and South Dakota 
to 401 abortions per 1,000 live births in New York [city and 
state combined]). Because of variation that occurred among 
reporting areas in the percentage of abortions obtained by 
out-of-state residents (from 0.4% in Hawaii to 57.3% in the 
District of Columbia), abortion rates and ratios calculated by 
maternal residence might provide a more accurate reflection of 
the state-specific distribution of women obtaining abortions. 
However, because states vary in the level of detail they collect 
on maternal residence, 11.9% of abortions were reported to 
CDC without exact information on maternal residence.
 
§§ States that did not report for ≥1 year since 1998 include Alaska (1998–2000), 
California (1998–2012), Louisiana (2005), Maryland (2007–2012), New 
Hampshire (1998–2012), Oklahoma (1998–1999), and West Virginia 
(2004–2005).
 
¶¶ Excludes California, Louisiana, Maryland, New Hampshire, and West Virginia.
 *** Comparisons do not include Wyoming, which reported <20 abortions.
 ††† Comparisons by residence status do not include California, Florida, 
Maryland, or New Hampshire. Because these areas either did not report or 
did not report abortions by maternal residence, numbers are available only 
from other states where their residents obtained abortions. As a consequence, 
meaningful statistics cannot be reported.

Among the 47 areas that reported by maternal age for 2013, 
women in their 20s accounted for the majority (58.6%) of 
abortions and had the highest abortion rates (21.8 and 18.2 
abortions per 1,000 women aged 20–24 and 25–29 years, 
respectively) (Figure 2) (Table 3). Women in the youngest 
(<15 years) and oldest (≥40 years) age groups accounted for the 
smallest percentages of abortions (0.3% and 3.6%, respectively) 
and had the lowest abortion rates (0.6 and 2.5 abortions per 
1,000 women aged <15 and ≥40 years, respectively). Among 
the 42 reporting areas that provided data by maternal age every 
year during 2004–2013, this pattern across age groups was 
stable, with the majority of abortions and the highest abortion 
rates occurring among women aged 20–29 years and the lowest 
percentages of abortions and abortion rates occurring among 
women in the youngest and oldest age groups (Table 4). During 
2004–2013, abortion rates decreased among all age groups 
<40 years, although the decreases for adolescents (54% and 
46% for adolescents aged <15 and 15–19 years, respectively) 
were greater than the decreases for women in older age groups 
(8%–27% for women aged 20–39 years). For all age groups, 
decreases in the abortion rate were greater from 2009 to 2013 
than from 2004 to 2008, and these decreases continued from 
2012 to 2013.
In contrast to the percentage of abortion numbers and 
abortion rates, abortion ratios in 2013 were highest among 
adolescents aged ≤19 years and lowest among women aged 
30–39 years (Figure 2) (Table 3). Among the 42 reporting 
areas that provided data by maternal age for every year during 
2004–2013, abortion ratios decreased among women in all 
age groups except adolescents aged <15. For all age groups, 
decreases in the abortion ratio were greater from 2009 to 2013 
than from 2004 to 2008, and these decreases continued from 
2012 to 2013 (Table 4).

Adolescents
Among the 46 areas that reported maternal age by individual 
year among adolescents for 2013, adolescents aged 18–19 years 
accounted for the majority (67.2%) of adolescent abortions 
and had the highest adolescent abortion rates (11.5 and 
15.6 abortions per 1,000 adolescents aged 18 and 19 years, 
respectively); adolescents aged <15 years accounted for the 
smallest percentage (2.9%) of adolescent abortions and 
had the lowest adolescent abortion rate (0.6 abortions per 
1,000 adolescents aged 13–14 years) (Table 5). Among the 
40 reporting areas that provided data for adolescents by 
individual year of maternal age every year during 2004–2013, 
the percentage of abortions accounted for by adolescents 
aged 19 years increased, whereas the percentage of abortions 
accounted for by adolescents aged <19 years decreased. 
Among adolescents of all ages, abortion rates decreased, but 
the decreases were smaller for adolescents aged 19 years as 
compared with adolescents <19 years (Table 6). For all age 
groups, decreases in the abortion rate were greater from 2009 
to 2013 than from 2004 to 2008, and these decreases continued 
from 2012 to 2013.
In 2013, the abortion ratio for adolescents decreased with 
increasing age and was lowest among adolescents aged 19 years 
(Table 5). Among the 40 reporting areas that provided data 
for adolescents by individual year of maternal age for every 
year during 2004–2013, abortion ratios decreased among 
adolescents of all ages except for those aged <15 years, for 
whom the abortion ratio increased slightly (2%) (Table 6).

Gestational Age
Among the 40 areas that reported gestational age at the time 
of abortion for 2013, the majority (66.0%) of abortions were 
performed by ≤8 weeks’ gestation and 91.6% were performed at 
≤13 weeks’ gestation (Table 7). Few abortions were performed 
between 14 and 20 weeks’ gestation (7.1%) or at ≥21 weeks’ 
gestation (1.3%). Among the 30 reporting areas that provided 
data on gestational age every year during 2004–2013, the 
percentage of abortions performed at ≤13 weeks’ gestation 
was stable (Table 8). However, within this gestational age 
range, a shift occurred toward earlier gestational ages at time 
of abortion, with the percentage of abortions performed at 
≤8 weeks’ gestation increasing 4% and the percentage of 
abortions performed at 9–13 weeks’ gestation decreasing 
10%. For the entire period of analysis, abortions performed 
at >13 weeks’ gestation accounted for a small percentage of 
abortions (≤8.5%).
Among abortions performed at ≤13 weeks’ gestation and 
reported by individual week of gestation for 2013, 37.8% 
were performed at ≤6 weeks’ gestation (Table 9). Among the 
remaining abortions performed between 7 and 13 weeks’ 
gestation, the percentage contribution was progressively smaller 
for each additional week of gestation: 19.6% were performed 
at 7 weeks’ gestation and 3.1% were performed at 13 weeks’ 
gestation. Among the 30 areas that reported by exact week of 
gestation for abortions performed at ≤13 weeks’ gestation every 
year during 2004–2013, the percentage of abortions shifted 
toward earlier gestational ages. Abortions performed at ≤6 weeks’ 
gestation increased 16% and those performed at 7–12 weeks’ 
gestation decreased in the range of 3%–16% (Table 10).
Method Type
Among the 43 areas that reported by method type for 2013 
and included medical abortion on their reporting form for 
medical providers, 67.9% of abortions were performed by 
curettage at ≤13 weeks’ gestation, 22.2% were performed by 
early medical abortion (a nonsurgical abortion at ≤8 weeks’ 
gestation), and 8.6% were performed by curettage at 
>13 weeks’ gestation; all other methods were uncommon 
(Table 11). Among the 33 reporting areas that included medical 
abortion on their reporting form and provided these data for 
the relevant years of comparison (2004 versus 2013, 2004 
versus 2008, 2009 versus 2013, and 2012 versus 2013),§§§ 
use of early medical abortion increased 5% from 2012 to 2013 
(from 21.3% of abortions to 22.3%); from 2004 to 2013, 
use of early medical abortion increased 110% (from 10.6% 
of abortions to 22.3%). Large increases in medical abortion 
occurred both from 2004 to 2008 (from 10.6% of abortions to 
15.2% [43% increase]) and from 2009 to 2013 (from 17.1% 
of abortions to 22.3% [30% increase]). In contrast, use of 
curettage at ≤13 weeks’ gestation decreased 15% from 2004 
to 2013 (from 79.7% of abortions to 67.9%). Curettage at 
>13 weeks’ gestation consistently accounted for approximately 
8.0% of all abortions, and all other methods consistently 
accounted for a small percentage of abortions (<0.1%–1.3%) 
during 2004–2013.
Race/Ethnicity
Among the 29 areas that reported cross-classified race/
ethnicity data for 2013, non-Hispanic white women and non-
Hispanic black women accounted for the largest percentages 
of abortions (37.3% and 35.6%, respectively) and Hispanic 
women and non-Hispanic women in the other race category 
accounted for smaller percentages (19.0% and 8.1%, 
respectively) (Table 12). Non-Hispanic white women had the 
lowest abortion rate (7.2 abortions per 1,000 women aged 
15–44 years) and ratio (121 abortions per 1,000 live births) 
and non-Hispanic black women had the highest abortion rate 
(27.0 abortions per 1,000 women aged 15–44 years) and ratio 
(420 abortions per 1,000 live births). Data for 2013 are also 
reported separately by race and by ethnicity (Tables 13 and 14).
Among the 20 areas¶¶¶ that reported by race/ethnicity for 
2007 (the first year with available data), 2012, and 2013, 
abortion rates decreased substantially for all three major racial/
ethnic groups: for non-Hispanic white women, the abortion 
rate decreased 26% (from 9.3 abortions per 1,000 women 
in 2007 to 6.9 in 2013), for non-Hispanic black women it 
decreased 25% (from 36.8 abortions per 1,000 women in 
2007 to 27.5 in 2013), and for Hispanic women it decreased 
33% (from 20.8 abortions per 1,000 women in 2007 to 14.0 
in 2013). Abortion ratios also decreased from 2007 to 2013. 
For non-Hispanic white women, the abortion ratio decreased 
23% (from 145 abortions per 1,000 live births in 2007 to 112 
in 2013), for non-Hispanic black women it decreased 17% 
(from 514 abortions per 1,000 live births in 2007 to 425 in 
2013), and for Hispanic women it decreased 13% (from 209 
abortions per 1,000 live births in 2007 to 181 in 2013).

Marital Status
Among the 42 areas that reported by marital status for 2013, 
14.8% of all women who obtained an abortion were married 
and 85.2% were unmarried (Table 15). The abortion ratio 
was 46 abortions per 1,000 live births for married women and 
387 abortions per 1,000 live births for unmarried women. 
Among the 31 reporting areas**** that provided these data 
for the relevant years of comparison (2004 versus 2013, 2004 
versus 2008, 2009 versus 2013, and 2012 versus 2013), the 
percentage of abortions among unmarried women increased 
3% from 2004 to 2013 (from 82.6% to 85.3%). The increase 
from 2004 to 2008 (2%) was larger than the increase from 
2009 to 2013 (<1%). Among married women, the abortion 
ratio decreased 22% from 2004 to 2013 (from 58 to 45 
abortions per 1,000 live births), with a larger decrease occurring 
from 2009 to 2013 (15%) than from 2004 to 2008 (5%). 
Among unmarried women, the abortion ratio decreased 18% 
from 2004 to 2013 (from 472 to 389 abortions per 1,000 live 
births), with a larger decrease also occurring from 2009 to 2013 
(11%) than from 2004 to 2008 (5%).
Previous Live Births and Abortions
Data from the 41 areas that reported the number of previous 
live births for women who obtained abortions in 2013 indicate 
that 40.2%, 45.6%, and 14.1% of these women had zero, 
one to two, or three or more previous live births, respectively 
(Table 16). Among the 33 reporting areas†††† that provided 
these data for the relevant years of comparison (2004 versus 
2013, 2004 versus 2008, 2009 versus 2013, and 2012 versus 
2013), the percentage of women obtaining abortions who had 
no previous live births changed by <1% from 2004 to 2013; 
by contrast, the percentage decreased for women who had 
one to two previous live births (4%) and increased for women 
who had three or more previous live births (13%). Among the 
areas included in this comparison, 39.9%, 47.5%, and 12.6% 
of women had zero, one to two, or three or more previous 
live births, respectively, in 2004; 40.1%, 45.7%, and 14.2% 
of women had zero, one to two, or three or more live births, 
respectively, in 2013.
Data from the 39 areas that reported the number of previous 
abortions for women who obtained abortions in 2013 
indicate that the majority (55.0%) had no previous abortions, 
36.2% had one to two previous abortions, and 8.8% had 
three or more previous abortions (Table 17). Among the 30 
reporting areas§§§§ that provided data for the relevant years 
of comparison (2004 to 2013, 2004 versus 2008, 2009 versus 
2013, and 2012 versus 2013), the percentage of women who 
had zero or one to two previous abortions did not change 
appreciably over time: 54.9%, 54.8%, and 54.9% had zero 
previous abortions in 2004, 2012, and 2013, respectively, and 
37.1%, 36.0%, and 36.0% had one to two previous abortions 
in 2004, 2012, and 2013, respectively. In contrast, among 
these 30 areas, the percentage of women who had three or 
more previous abortions increased from 2004 to 2013 but did 
not change appreciably from 2012 to 2013: 8.0% had three 
or more previous abortions in 2004, as compared with 9.3% 
in 2012 and 9.1% in 2013.
Maternal Age and Marital Status 
by Race/Ethnicity
In certain reporting areas, abortions that were categorized 
by maternal race and race/ethnicity were further categorized 
by maternal age and by marital status (Tables 18 and 19). 
A consistent pattern existed for abortions by maternal age 
across all race/ethnicity groups, with the smallest percentage 
of abortions occurring among adolescents aged <15 years 
(0.2%–0.4%) and the largest percentage occurring among 
women aged 20–24 years (27.8%–34.1%) (Table 19). A 
consistent pattern also existed for abortions by marital status 
across all race/ethnicity groups, with a higher percentage of 
abortions occurring among women who were unmarried 
(68.6%–91.7%) than among those who were married (8.3%–
31.4%) (Table 19). However, for abortions among unmarried 
women, the percentage was higher for non-Hispanic black 
women (91.7%) than for non-Hispanic white (82.8%) or 
Hispanic women (84.1%) (Table 19).
Weeks of Gestation by Maternal Age, 
Race/Ethnicity, and Method Type
In certain reporting areas, abortions that were categorized by 
weeks of gestation were further categorized by maternal age, 
race, and race/ethnicity (Tables 20 and 21). In every subgroup 
for these three variables, the largest percentage of abortions was 
obtained at ≤8 weeks’ gestation. However, by maternal age,

44.9% of adolescents aged <15 years and 57.1% of adolescents 
aged 15–19 years obtained an abortion by ≤8 weeks’ gestation 
compared with 63.9%–72.2% of women in older age groups 
(Figure 3) (Table 20). Conversely 20.6% of adolescents 
aged <15 years and 11.9% of adolescents aged 15–19 years 
obtained an abortion after 13 weeks’ gestation compared with 
7.1%–8.7% for women in older age groups. By race/ethnicity, 
60.3% of non-Hispanic black women obtained an abortion at 
≤8 weeks’ gestation compared with 68.7%–71.7% of women 
from other racial/ethnic groups. Non-Hispanic black women 
obtained the highest percentage of abortions after 13 weeks’ 
gestation, but differences across racial/ethnic groups were 
less apparent than differences across age groups (9.4% for 
non-Hispanic black women compared with 7.1%–8.0% for 
women in the remaining race/ethnicity groups).
Among abortions categorized by weeks of gestation and 
method type, curettage accounted for the largest percentage 
of abortions within every gestational age category (Table 22). 
At ≤8 weeks’ gestation, curettage accounted for a smaller 
percentage of abortions (67.2%) than at any other stage of 
gestation. At 9–20 weeks’ gestation, curettage accounted for 
96.7%–99.1% of all abortions; this percentage then decreased 
to 90.8% of abortions at ≥21 weeks’ gestation. By contrast, 
at ≤8 weeks’ gestation early medical abortion accounted for 
32.8% of abortions, but at all subsequent points in gestation, 
medical abortion accounted for only 0.8%–8.2% of reported

abortions. Throughout gestation, abortions performed by 
intrauterine instillation or hysterectomy/hysterotomy were 
rare (<0.01%–0.8% of abortions).
Abortion Mortality
Using national data from the Pregnancy Mortality 
Surveillance System (41), CDC identified four abortion-related 
deaths for 2012 (Table 23). These deaths were identified either 
by some indication of abortion on the death certificate, by 
reports from a health care provider or public health agency, 
or from a media report. Investigation of these cases indicated 
that all four deaths were related to legal abortion and none to 
illegal abortion.
The annual number of deaths related to legal induced 
abortion has fluctuated from year to year over the past 39 years 
(Table 23). For example, 10 legal induced abortion-related 
deaths occurred in 1994, four deaths in 1995, and nine deaths 
in 1996. Because of this variability and the relatively small 
number of legal induced abortion-related deaths every year, 
national legal abortion case-fatality rates were calculated for 
consecutive 5-year periods during 1973–2012. The national 
legal induced abortion case-fatality rate for 2008–2012 was 
0.65 legal induced abortion-related deaths per 100,000 reported 
legal abortions. This case-fatality rate was similar to the rate 
for most of the preceding 5-year periods but lower than the 
case-fatality rate of 2.09 legal induced abortion-related deaths 
per 100,000 reported legal abortions for the 5-year period 
(1973–1977) immediately following nationwide legalization 
of abortion in 1973. Possible abortion-related deaths that 
occurred during 2013–2016 are under investigation.
Discussion
For 2013, a total of 664,435 abortions were reported to 
CDC. Of these abortions, 652,582 (98.2%) were from 47 
reporting areas that submitted data every year during 2004–
2013, thus providing the information necessary for evaluating 
trends. These 47 areas had an abortion rate of 12.5 abortions 
per 1,000 women aged 15–44 years and an abortion ratio of 
200 abortions per 1,000 live births. Compared with 2012, this 
represents a 5% decrease in the total number (from 688,149), 
rate (from 13.2 abortions per 1,000 women), and ratio (from 
210 abortions per 1,000 live births) of reported abortions. 
Combined with decreases from the previous 4 years (16–19), 
all three measures of abortion reached their lowest level for the 
entire period of analysis (2004–2013).
In addition to highlighting changes that occurred among 
all women of reproductive age, this report underscores 
important maternal age differences in abortion trends. 
During 2004–2013, abortion rates for women in their 20s 
were consistently higher than for any other age group and 
women in their 20s accounted for the majority of abortions 
(56%–59%); therefore, they have contributed substantially to 
overall changes. Conversely, during 2004–2013 women aged 
≥40 years had consistently low abortion rates and accounted for 
a small percentage of abortions (≤3.7%); therefore, they have 
had a much smaller contribution to overall abortion trends. 
Nonetheless, among women aged ≥40 years, the abortion ratio 
continues to be as high as that for women in their 20s. Given 
the small proportion of abortions that are performed later in 
gestation among women aged ≥40, which potentially might be 
completed for maternal medical indications or fetal anomalies, 
the continuing high abortion ratio among these older women 
suggests that unintended pregnancy is a problem that women 
encounter throughout their reproductive years.
The adolescent abortion trends described in this report 
are important for monitoring progress that has been made 
toward reducing adolescent pregnancies in the United States. 
During 1991–2011, the pregnancy rate for adolescents aged 
15–19 years decreased 55% to an historic low (43). This 
decrease was associated with a larger decrease in adolescent 
abortions (64%) as compared with births (49%) (43). More 
recent data indicate that the birth rate for adolescents aged 
15–19 years decreased 29% from 2011 to 2015 (44–48). 
The 12% decrease from 2012 to 2013 in the abortion rate 
for adolescents aged 15–19 years suggests that adolescent 
pregnancies in the United States continue to decrease and 
that this decrease continues to be accompanied by substantial 
decreases in adolescent abortions as well as live births.
The findings in this report indicate that the number, rate, 
and ratio of reported abortions have declined across all race/
ethnicity groups, but that well-documented disparities persist 
(3–10). Comparatively high abortion rates and ratios among 
non-Hispanic black women have been attributed to higher 
unintended pregnancy rates and a greater percentage of 
unintended pregnancies ending in abortion (49,50). Data 
from certain reports suggest that differences in abortion 
indicators between non-Hispanic black women and women 
of other groups narrowed during 1994–2008 (4,9), but have 
remained steady since 2008 (10). Data reported to CDC for 
2013 and in previous years suggest similar declines in abortion 
rates among non-Hispanic white and black women. Higher 
abortion rates among Hispanic compared with non-Hispanic 
white women have been attributed to higher pregnancy rates, 
including intended and unintended pregnancies, among 
Hispanic women (49,50). However, abortion ratios for these 
two groups have been more comparable: Hispanic women 
have had a slightly higher percentage of pregnancies that are 
unintended but are no more likely than non-Hispanic white 
 12 
MMWR / November 25, 2016 / Vol. 65 / No. 12
women to end unintended pregnancies in abortion (49,50). 
Differences between non-Hispanic white and Hispanic women 
in abortion rates narrowed only slightly from 2007 to 2013, 
with large declines occurring among both groups of women.
The findings in this report indicate women are obtaining 
abortions earlier in gestation, when the risks for complications 
are lowest (51–54). Among the areas that reported data every 
year during 2004–2013, the percentage of abortions performed 
at ≤8 weeks’ gestation increased 4%. Moreover, among the 
areas that reported abortions at ≤13 weeks’ gestation by 
individual week, the distribution continued to shift toward 
earlier weeks of gestation with the percentage of early abortions 
performed at ≤6 weeks’ gestation increasing 16%. Nonetheless, 
the overall percentage of abortions performed at ≤13 weeks’ 
gestation changed little during 2004–2013, and findings from 
this and other reports suggest that delays in obtaining an 
abortion are more common among certain groups of women 
(55–57). Because of the small but persistent percentage of 
women who obtain abortions at >13 weeks’ gestation, a better 
understanding is needed of the factors that cause delays in 
obtaining abortions (55,57–60).
The trend of obtaining abortions earlier in pregnancy has 
been facilitated by changes in abortion practices. Research 
conducted in the United States during the 1970s indicated 
that surgical abortion procedures performed at ≤6 weeks’ 
gestation as compared with 7–12 weeks’ gestation were less 
likely to result in successful termination of the pregnancy (61). 
However, subsequent advances in technology (e.g., improved 
transvaginal ultrasonography and sensitive pregnancy tests) 
have allowed very early surgical abortions to be performed 
with completion rates exceeding 97% (54,62–64). Likewise, 
the development of medical abortion regimens has allowed 
for abortions to be performed very early in gestation, with 
completion rates for regimens that combine mifepristone and 
misoprostol reaching 96%–98% (65). In 2013, 66.0% of all 
reported abortions were performed at ≤8 completed weeks’ 
gestation, and thus the women receiving these abortions were 
eligible for early medical abortion on the basis of gestational 
age; 32.8% of abortions at ≤8 weeks’ gestation and 22.2% of 
all abortions were reported as medical abortions. Moreover, the 
use of early medical abortion has continued to rise: from 2004 
to 2013, the percentage of all reported abortions accounted 
for by this method increased 110%. In early 2016, the Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA) updated its approval for use 
of mifepristone for early medical abortions, extending the 
gestational age limit to 70 days (≤9 completed weeks) on the 
basis of extensive safety and efficacy data (66). The definition 
of early medical abortion will change in subsequent years to 
include this additional week of gestation in accordance with 
FDA revised labeling.
The annual number of deaths related to legal induced 
abortion has fluctuated from year to year over the past 39 years. 
Because of this variability and the relatively small number of 
abortion-related deaths every year, national legal abortion 
case-fatality rates were calculated for consecutive 5-year periods 
during 1973–2012. The national legal induced abortion case-
fatality rate for 2008–2012 was similar to the case-fatality rate 
for most of the preceding 5-year periods, but was much lower 
than the case-fatality rate for the 5-year period (1973–1978) 
that immediately followed nationwide legalization of abortion 
in 1973.
Limitations
The findings in this report are subject to at least four 
limitations. First, because reporting requirements are 
established by the individual reporting areas (21), the collection 
of data varies and CDC is unable to obtain the total number of 
abortions performed in the United States. During the period 
covered by this report, the total annual number of abortions 
reported to CDC was consistently approximately 70% of the 
number recorded by the Guttmacher Institute (15,67), which 
uses numerous active follow-up techniques to increase the 
completeness of the data obtained through its periodic national 
census of abortion providers (15). Although most reporting 
areas collect and send abortion data to CDC, this information 
is submitted to CDC voluntarily. Consequently, during 
2004–2013, five of the 52 reporting areas did not provide 
CDC data on a consistent annual basis, and for 2013 CDC 
did not obtain any information from California, Maryland, or 
New Hampshire.¶¶¶¶ In addition, whereas most reporting areas 
that send abortion data to CDC have laws requiring medical 
providers to submit a report for every abortion they perform 
to a central health agency, in New Jersey and the District 
of Columbia, medical providers submit this information 
voluntarily (68). As a result, the abortion numbers these areas 
report to CDC are incomplete.***** Moreover, even in states 
that legally require medical providers to submit a report for all 
the abortions they perform, enforcement of this requirement 
 ¶¶¶¶ In 2011, the most recent year for which the Guttmacher Institute has 
published data, abortions performed in California, Maryland, and New 
Hampshire accounted for 21% of all abortions counted through the 
Guttmacher Institute’s national census of abortion providers (15).
 
***** In 2011, the abortion numbers that CDC obtained from the District of 
Columbia and New Jersey were 58% and 57%, respectively, of the abortion 
numbers that the Guttmacher Institute obtained for these areas through 
their national census of abortion providers (15).
 MMWR / November 25, 2016 / Vol. 65 / No. 12

varies and as a consequence several other reporting areas tend 
to provide CDC with incomplete numbers.†††††
Second, because reporting requirements are established by 
the individual reporting areas, many states use reporting forms 
that do not follow the technical standards and guidance CDC 
developed in collaboration with the National Association 
of Public Health Statistics and Information Systems. 
Consequently, many reporting areas do not collect all the 
information CDC compiles on the characteristics of women 
obtaining abortions (e.g., maternal age, race, and ethnicity). 
Although missing demographic information can reduce the 
extent to which the statistics in this report represent all women 
in the United States, five nationally representative surveys 
of women obtaining abortions in 1987, 1994–1995, 2001–
2002, 2008, and 2014 (5–8,10) have produced percentage 
distributions for most characteristics that are nearly identical to 
the percentage distributions reported by CDC. The exception 
is the percentage distribution of abortions by race/ethnicity. 
In particular, the percentage of abortions accounted for by 
non-Hispanic black women is higher in this report than the 
percentage determined on the basis of a recent nationally 
representative survey of women obtaining abortions (10). 
Differences might be attributable both to the high degree 
of imprecision for this variable that reduces the reliability of 
national survey results (8,9) and because the number of states 
that report to CDC by race/ethnicity continues to be somewhat 
lower than for other demographic variables. Importantly, some 
reporting areas that have not reported to CDC, or have not 
reported cross-classified race/ethnicity data (e.g., California, 
Florida, and Illinois), have sufficiently large populations of 
minority women that the absence of data from these areas 
reduces the representativeness of CDC data.
Similar to the case for race/ethnicity, the absence of medical 
abortion as a specific category on the reporting form used 
by some states (68) might reduce the accuracy of CDC’s 
estimates of the use of this method relative to other abortion 
methods. Furthermore, even in states with medical abortion 
on their reporting form, it is possible that this method is 
disproportionately undercounted. A higher percentage of the 
abortions provided in physician’s offices and smaller caseload 
facilities are early medical abortions (14,69), and these practices 
might be difficult to locate in the wider medical community 
without active surveillance efforts (69). Nonetheless, a recent 
comparison of CDC data with mifepristone sales data§§§§§ 
suggests that CDC’s Abortion Surveillance System accurately 
describes the use of early medical abortion relative to other 
abortion methods in the United States (70). In 2013, however, 
professional clinical practice guidelines were updated midyear 
to extend the gestational age eligibility for early medical 
abortion to 70 days (≤9 completed weeks) (66,71). Findings 
in this report do not reflect this midyear practice change, 
only classifying abortions as early medical abortions when 
performed at ≤8 weeks’ gestation.
Third, abortion data are compiled and reported to CDC by 
the central health agency of the reporting area in which the 
abortion was performed rather than the reporting area in which 
the woman lived. Thus, the available population (27–36) and 
birth data (37), which are organized by the states in which 
women live, differs in some cases from the population of 
women who undergo abortions in a given reporting area. This 
likely results in an overestimation of abortions for reporting 
areas in which a high percentage of abortions are obtained by 
out-of-state residents and an underestimation of abortions for 
states where residents frequently obtain abortions out of state. 
Limited abortion services, more stringent legal requirements 
for obtaining an abortion, or geographic proximity to services 
in another state might influence where women obtain abortion 
services. To adjust for these reporting biases, CDC attempts 
to categorize abortions by residence in addition to geographic 
occurrence. However, in 2013, CDC was unable to identify 
the reporting area, territory, or country of residence for 11.9% 
of reported abortions.
Finally, reporting areas provide CDC with aggregate 
numbers rather than individual-level records. Because CDC 
does not obtain individual-level records, stratified analyses by 
socioeconomic status cannot be done.
Public Health Implications
Ongoing surveillance of legal induced abortion is important 
for several reasons. First, abortion surveillance is needed to 
guide and evaluate the success of programs aimed at preventing 
unintended pregnancies. Although pregnancy intentions are 
 
††††† In 2011, the abortion numbers CDC obtained for Wyoming were <5% 
of the numbers obtained for this state by the Guttmacher Institute through 
their national census of abortion providers. CDC numbers for Hawaii 
were 48% of the Guttmacher Institute numbers. CDC numbers for Alaska, 
Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Idaho, Iowa, Louisiana, Maine, 
Massachusetts, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico, New York (city and state 
combined), Ohio, Oregon, and West Virginia were 65%–<90% of the 
Guttmacher Institute numbers. All other areas with legal reporting 
requirements that provided data to CDC obtained numbers that were at 
least 90% of the Guttmacher Institute numbers (15).
 
§§§§§ Because the sole distributor of mifepristone in the United States only sells 
this medication to licensed physicians, who must sign and return a 
prescriber’s agreement, sales data from this company are not limited by 
individual state reporting requirements or the difficulties of identifying 
smaller providers within the wider medical community.

difficult to assess (72–79), abortion surveillance provides an 
important measure of pregnancies that are unwanted. Second, 
routine abortion surveillance is needed to assess trends in clinical 
practice patterns over time. Information in this report on the 
number of abortions performed through different methods 
(e.g., medical or curettage) and at different gestational ages 
provides the denominator data that are necessary for analyses 
of the relative safety of abortion practices. Finally, information 
on the number of pregnancies ending in abortion are needed 
in conjunction with data on births and fetal losses to more 
accurately estimate the number of pregnancies in the United 
States and determine rates for various outcomes of public health 
importance (e.g., adolescent pregnancies) (43,80).
According to the most recent national estimates from 
2010, 18% of all pregnancies in the United States end in 
abortion (81). Multiple factors influence the incidence of 
abortion. These factors include access to health care services, 
including contraception (82–84); the availability of abortion 
providers (14,15,85–87); state regulations, such as mandatory 
waiting periods (88), parental involvement laws (89), and 
legal restrictions on abortion providers (90,91); increasing 
acceptance of nonmarital childbearing (92,93); shifts in the 
racial/ethnic composition of the U.S. population (94,95); and 
changes in the economy and the resulting impact on fertility 
preferences and use of contraception (96,97). However, because 
unintended pregnancy precedes nearly all abortions (26),¶¶¶¶¶ 
efforts to reduce the incidence of abortion need to focus on 
helping women, men, and couples avoid pregnancies that they 
do not desire.
Providing women and men with the knowledge and resources 
necessary to make decisions about their sexual behavior and use 
of contraception can help them avoid unintended pregnancies. 
Recent data indicate that the proportion of pregnancies in the 
United States that were unintended decreased from 51% in 
2008 to 45% during 2011–2013, after slight increases from 
2001 to 2008 (98). One factor that might have contributed 
to this decrease is the increase that occurred during the same 
period in the use of the most effective forms of reversible 
contraception, specifically intrauterine devices and hormonal 
implants, which are as effective as sterilization at preventing 
unintended pregnancy (99,100–102). Although use of 
intrauterine devices and implants has increased in recent years, 
use of these methods remains low in comparison with use 
of oral contraceptives and condoms, both of which are less 
effective at preventing pregnancy (99,101). Research has 
indicated that providing contraception for women at no cost 
can increase use of these methods and reduce abortion rates 
(82–84). Cost, as well as insufficient provider reimbursement 
and training, inadequate client-centered counseling or 
youth friendly services, and low client awareness of available 
contraceptive methods, are common barriers to accessing 
contraception (103). Removing these barriers can help improve 
contraceptive use, thereby reducing the number of unintended 
pregnancies (103,104) and consequently the number of 
abortions performed in the United States.

§ Additional details on the state in which abortions were provided, cross-tabulated by the state of maternal residence, are available at http://www.cdc.gov/
reproductivehealth/data_stats/Abortion.htm.
 
¶ Reporting area did not report; because numbers for this area are available only from other reporting areas where residents obtained abortions, meaningful statistics 
cannot be reported.
 ** Because reporting is not mandatory, a complete number of abortions performed in the District of Columbia could not be obtained.
 †† Reported by occurrence only; because abortion numbers by residence for Florida are available only from other reporting areas where residents obtained abortions, 
meaningful statistics cannot be reported.
 §§ Reporting area reported abortion numbers for both in-state and out-of-state residents; for out-of-state residents, the state or area of residence was not provided.
 ¶¶ Data from hospitals and licensed ambulatory care facilities only; because reporting is not mandatory for private physicians and women’s centers, a complete 
number of abortions performed in New Jersey could not be obtained.
 
*** Total abortion number <20.
 ††† Abortion rates and ratios and percentage of abortions obtained by out-of-state residents were not calculated for Wyoming because results based on a small 
number of abortions are unstable.

TABLE 3. (Continued) Reported abortions, by known age group and reporting area of occurrence — selected reporting areas,* United States, 2013
 * Data from 47 reporting areas; excludes five reporting areas (California, Florida, Maryland, New Hampshire, and Wyoming) that did not report, did not report by 
age, or did not meet reporting standards.
 
† Percentages for the individual component categories might not add to 100 because of rounding.
 
§ Percentage is calculated as the number of abortions reported by known age divided by the sum of abortions reported by known and unknown age.
 
¶ Because reporting is not mandatory, a complete number of abortions performed in the District of Columbia could not be obtained.
 ** Cell details are not displayed because of small numbers (n = 1–4).
 †† Includes residents only.
 §§ Data from hospitals and licensed ambulatory care facilities only; because reporting is not mandatory for private physicians and women’s centers, information 
could not be obtained for all abortions performed in New Jersey.
 ¶¶ Percentage based on a total of 587,977 abortions reported among the areas that met reporting standards for age.
 
*** Number of abortions obtained by women in a given age group per 1,000 women in that same age group. Women aged 13–14 years were used as the denominator 
for the group of women aged <15 years, and women aged 40–44 years were used as the denominator for the group of women aged ≥40 years. Women aged 
15–44 years were used as the denominator for the overall rate. For each reporting area, abortions for women of unknown age were distributed according to the 
distribution of abortions among women of known age for that area.
 ††† Number of abortions obtained by women in a given age group per 1,000 live births to women in that same age group. For each reporting area, abortions for 
women of unknown age were distributed according to the distribution of abortions among women of known age for that area.

* Data from 42 reporting areas; by year, these reporting areas represent 96%–98% of all abortions reported to CDC by age during 2004–2013. Excludes 10 reporting 
areas (California, District of Columbia, Florida, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, New Hampshire, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wyoming) that did not report, did not report 
by age, or did not meet reporting standards for ≥1 year.
† Number of abortions obtained by women in a given age group per 1,000 women in that same age group. Women aged 13–14 years were used as the denominator 
for the group of women aged <15 years, and women aged 40–44 years were used as the denominator for the group of women aged ≥40 years. Women aged 15–44 
years were used as the denominator for the overall rate. For each reporting area, abortions for women of unknown age were distributed according to the distribution 
of abortions among women of known age for that area.

 * Data from 46 reporting areas; excludes six reporting areas (California, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, New Hampshire, and Wyoming) that did not report, did not report 
age among adolescents by individual year, or did not meet reporting standards.
 † Percentages for the individual component categories might not add to 100 because of rounding.
 § Cell details are not displayed because of small numbers (n = 1–4).
 ¶ Because reporting is not mandatory, a complete number of abortions performed in the District of Columbia could not be obtained.
 ** Data from hospitals and licensed ambulatory care facilities only; because reporting is not mandatory for private physicians and women’s centers, information could 
not be obtained for all abortions performed in New Jersey.
 †† Includes residents only.

 * Gestational age based on the clinician’s estimate (Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, 
Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York City, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, 
South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Washington, and West Virginia); gestational age calculated from the last normal menstrual period (Arkansas, 
Oklahoma, and Virginia); method of determining gestational age not specified (Delaware, Mississippi, and North Dakota).
 † Data are from 40 reporting areas; excludes 12 areas (California, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New 
York State, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Wyoming) that did not report, did not report by gestational age, or did not meet reporting standards.
 § Percentages for the individual component categories might not add to 100 because of rounding.
 ¶ Percentage is calculated as the number of abortions reported by known gestational age divided by the sum of abortions reported by known and unknown 
gestational age.
 ** Cell details are not displayed because of small numbers (n = 1–4).
 †† Data from hospitals and licensed ambulatory care facilities only; because reporting is not mandatory for private physicians and women’s centers, information could 
not be obtained for all abortions performed in New Jersey.
 
§§ Percentage is based on a total of 451,613 abortions reported among the areas that met reporting standards for gestational age.

TABLE 11. (Continued) Reported abortions, by known method type and reporting area of occurrence — selected reporting areas,* United 
States, 2013
Abbreviation: NA = not available.
 
* Data from 43 reporting areas; excludes nine reporting areas (California, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Louisiana, Maryland, New Hampshire, Tennessee, and Wyoming) 
that did not report, did not report by method type, or did not meet reporting standards.
 
† Includes aspiration curettage, suction curettage, manual vacuum aspiration, menstrual extraction, sharp curettage, and dilation and evacuation procedures.
 
§ Intrauterine instillations reported at ≤12 weeks’ gestation are not presented with abortions reported by known method type.
 
¶ Percentages for the individual component categories might not add to 100 because of rounding.
 ** Percentage is calculated as the number of abortions reported by known method type divided by the sum of abortions reported by known and unknown 
method type.
 
†† Cell details are not displayed because of small numbers (n = 1–4).
 
§§ Numbers for curettage procedures at ≤13 weeks versus >13 weeks and for medical abortion at ≤8 weeks versus >8 weeks are not presented because gestational 
age data were not provided or were provided in incompatible categories.
 
¶¶ Because reporting is not mandatory, a complete number of abortions performed in the District of Columbia could not be obtained.
 *** Data from hospitals and licensed ambulatory care facilities only; because reporting is not mandatory for private physicians and women’s centers, information 
could not be obtained for all abortions performed in New Jersey.
 ††† All abortions were reported as surgical or chemically induced. For this report, all surgical abortions were classified as curettage and all chemical abortions as 
medical.
 §§§ Curettage abortions reported without a gestational age were distributed among the curettage categories according to the distribution of abortions performed 
by curettage at known gestational age.
 ¶¶¶ Medical abortions reported without a gestational age were distributed among the medical abortion categories according to the distribution of medical abortions 
at known gestational age.
 
**** Percentage is based on a total of 524,798 abortions reported among the areas that met reporting standards for method type.

† Percentages for the individual component categories might not add to 100 because of rounding.
 
§ Percentage is calculated as the number of abortions reported by known race/ethnicity divided by the sum of abortions reported by known and unknown 
race/ethnicity.
 
¶ Because reporting is not mandatory, a complete number of abortions performed in the District of Columbia could not be obtained.
 ** Data from hospitals and licensed ambulatory care facilities only; because reporting is not mandatory for private physicians and women’s centers, information 
could not be obtained for all abortions performed in New Jersey.
 †† Non-Hispanic categories include abortions for women whose ethnicity was reported as unknown; previous evaluation has shown that most reports without 
ethnicity are for non-Hispanic women.
 §§ Reporting form contains only one question for race and ethnicity; therefore, abortions reported for women of white, black, and other races (Asian and Native 
American) are not explicitly identified as non-Hispanic.
 ¶¶ Percentage is based on a total of 378,861 abortions reported among the areas that met reporting standards for race/ethnicity.
 
*** Number of abortions obtained by women in a given race/ethnicity group per 1,000 women in that same group. For each reporting area, abortions for women of 
unknown race/ethnicity were distributed according to the distribution of abortions among women of known race/ethnicity for that area.

 * Data from 42 reporting areas; excludes 10 areas (California, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Florida, Maryland, Nevada, New Hampshire, New York State, Washington, 
and Wyoming) that did not report, did not report by marital status, or did not meet reporting standards.
 † Percentages for the individual component categories might not add to 100 because of rounding.
 § Percentage is calculated as the number of abortions reported by known marital status divided by the sum of abortions reported by known and unknown marital status.
 ¶ Data from hospitals and licensed ambulatory care facilities only; because reporting is not mandatory for private physicians and women’s centers, information could 
not be obtained for all abortions performed in New Jersey.
 ** Percentage is based on a total of 523,213 abortions reported among the areas that met reporting standards for marital status.
 †† Number of abortions obtained by women by marital status per 1,000 live births to women of the same marital status. For each reporting area, abortions for women 
of unknown marital status were distributed according to the distribution of abortions among women of known marital status for that area.

(i.e., number of legal induced abortion-related deaths per 100,000 reported legal induced abortions in the United States) 
were calculated with denominator data from a more complete source (15,67). Case-fatality rates were computed for 
consecutive 5-year periods during 1973–2012 because rates based on <20 cases are highly variable (38).
 † Certain numbers might differ from those in reports published previously because additional information has been supplied 
to CDC subsequent to publication.
 § An abortion is defined as legal if it was performed by a licensed clinician within the limits of state law.
 ¶ An abortion is defined as illegal if it was performed by any person other than a licensed clinician.
 ** Unknown whether abortion was induced or spontaneous.
