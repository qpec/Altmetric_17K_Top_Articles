abstract
BACKGROUND: Children with disabilities are at increased risk of child maltreatment; however, 
there is a gap in the evidence about whether all disabilities are at equal risk and whether 
risk factors vary according to the type of disability.
METHODS: A population-based record-linkage study of all children born in Western Australia 
between 1990 and 2010. Children with disabilities were identified by using population-
based registers and risk of maltreatment determined by allegations reported to the 
Department for Child Protection and Family Support.
RESULTS: Although children with disabilities make up 10.4% of the population, they represent 
25.9% of children with a maltreatment allegation and 29.0% of those with a substantiated 
allegation; however, increased risk of maltreatment was not consistent across all disability 
types. Children with intellectual disability, mental/behavioral problems, and conduct 
disorder continued to have increased risk of an allegation and substantiated allegation 
after adjusting for child, family, and neighborhood risk factors. In contrast, adjusting 
for these factors resulted in children with autism having a lower risk, and children with 
Down syndrome and birth defects/cerebral palsy having the same risk as children without 
disability.
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of disabilities in the child protection system suggests a need 
for awareness of the scope of issues faced by these children and the need for interagency 
collaboration to ensure children’s complex needs are met. Supports are needed for families 
with children with disabilities to assist in meeting the child’s health and developmental 
needs, but also to support the parents in managing the often more complex parenting 
environment.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Children with 
disabilities experience elevated rates of child abuse 
and neglect. Only a few population-based studies 
have been conducted producing mixed evidence 
regarding maltreatment risk for children with 
different types of disabilities.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Children with disabilities 
account for 1 in 3 substantiated maltreatment 
allegations; however, maltreatment risk was not 
consistent across all disabilities. Children with 
intellectual disability, mental/behavioral problems, 
and conduct disorder had increased risk, but not 
autism, Down syndrome, or birth defects.

An estimated 5.1% of children 
worldwide have a moderate to severe 
disability. 
1 Research shows that 
children with disabilities experience 
elevated rates of child abuse and 
neglect. 
2 
 
– 
6 However, there are 
critical knowledge gaps, leading US 
researchers Kendall-Tackett et al 
7 to 
state “there is an appalling gap in the 
states’ ability to protect abused and 
neglected children with disabilities.”
At the most basic level, states/
countries need to know the 
proportion of children within their 
child protection systems who have 
disabilities, and their types of 
disability. 
7 Risk of maltreatment is 
associated with child characteristics, 
such as age and ethnicity; parent 
factors, such as young age, mental 
health problems, and substance 
abuse; and neighborhood factors, 
such as socioeconomic disadvantage. 
6 
Families of children with disabilities 
more frequently experience risk 
factors associated with a higher 
risk of maltreatment. 
8 However, 
the risk for maltreatment among 
children with disabilities has not 
been explored taking into account 
the multiple risk factors that often 
cooccur in the context of these 
families.
The few population-based studies 
conducted have produced mixed 
evidence regarding maltreatment 
risk for children with different types 
of disabilities, 
 
4, 
 
9, 
 
10 and it remains 
unclear whether disability types, 
such as intellectual disability (ID), are 
associated with increased risk. The 
aims of this research were to report 
the prevalence of different disabilities 
within the child protection system 
in an Australian state, and to assess 
risk of maltreatment in various types 
of disability taking into account 
child, family, and neighborhood risk 
factors.
METHODS
Population and Data Sources
We conducted a population-based 
record-linkage study of all children 
born in Western Australia (WA) 
between 1990 and 2010 using 
de-identified administrative data. 
Disability information was obtained 
from 4 sources that had information 
for the whole study period 1990 to 
2010. The first is the WA Register of 
Developmental Anomalies (WARDA), 
 
11 
which includes structural or 
functional birth defects that are 
present before birth and diagnosed 
by age 6, and cerebral palsy. WARDA 
receives notifications of birth defects 
from the Midwives Notification 
System, the Hospital Morbidity 
Data System (HMDS), and other 
services (eg, genetic, pathology, and 
private practitioners). The second 
is the population-based Intellectual 
Disability Exploring Answers 
(IDEA) 
12 database, which provides 
WA state data on individuals with ID 
and/or autism, by using information 
provided by the Disability Services 
Commission for individuals of 
any age with ID who are provided 
with services, and the Department 
of Education (individuals with 
ID receiving education support, 
predominantly aged 5–17 years). 
The IDEA database also collects 
information on severity of ID, and 
for cases obtained through the 
Disability Services Commission, the 
probable cause by using diagnostic 
information reviewed from medical 
records. Cases could be classified as 
caused by chromosomal disorders, 
metabolic disorders, prenatal 
exposure to alcohol, postnatal injury, 
cultural-familial (family history of 
ID/environmental disadvantage), and 
so forth. 
13 The third is HMDS, which 
contains information on all public 
and private hospital discharges, 
including up to 21 diagnostic 
codes by using the International 
Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes 
(ICD- 
9: 
1990–June 1999, ICD-10: July 
1999–2010, see  
Table 1). The fourth 
is the Mental Health Information 
System (MHIS), containing 
information on all mental health–
related public and private inpatient 
admissions and public outpatient 
contacts with diagnoses captured by 
using ICD codes. This study has ethics 
approval from the WA Department 
of Health Human Research Ethics 
Committee.
Disability for this article was defined 
as any limitation or impairment 
that may affect everyday activities 
ranging from intellectual, physical, 
and psychological conditions.

psychological conditions, which 
are often not diagnosed until 
adolescence, as well as disabilities 
typically diagnosed at birth or 
soon after. Children’s disabilities 
were identified through the 4 data 
sources of WARDA, IDEA, HMDS and 
MHIS, and disability groups were 
categorized as shown in  
Table 1. 
Disability categories were chosen 
because they were consistent 
with our definition, were the main 
disability groups identified in the 
sources, and their sample sizes were 
adequate for analyses. Children 
could be grouped in >1 category 
if they had comorbid conditions; 
however, Down syndrome (DS) was 
grouped separately because it is 
both a birth defect and causes ID. 
Of the 54 532 children who had ID, 
birth defect/cerebral palsy, autism, 
conduct disorder, or a mental/
behavioral disorder, 15.6% had ≥1 
comorbidities. For children with ID, 
there was a high rate of comorbidity 
with other conditions (62.6%).
We also included an additional 
analysis of 2 birth defect categories 
from the WARDA, spina bifida (n = 
192) and cleft lip and/or palate 
(n = 525), to compare with previous 
research. 
15
The disability data were linked to 
records from Births Registrations 
(1990–2010), the Midwives 
Notification System (1990–2010), 
Mortality Database (1990–2010), and 
the Department of Child Protection 
and Family Support (CPFS) (1990–
2010). Using probabilistic linkage of 
common identifiers, such as name, 
address, and birth date, the data were 
linked by the Department of Health’s 
Data Linkage Branch in which 
extensive clerical review also was 
conducted as per their process, with 
a linkage quality of 97% to 98%. 
16, 
 
17 
The identifiers were separated from 
the clinical or service information to 
maximize privacy during the linkage 
process, with only de-identified 
information provided to researchers.
The child’s sex, Aboriginality, birth 
weight, and gestational age were 
obtained from Births Registrations 
and Midwives Notification System, 
along with parents’ marital status 
and age at the time of birth. 
Neighborhood-level socioeconomic 
status was determined by the Index 
of Relative Social Disadvantage from 
the Australian Bureau of Statistics by 
using the Birth and Midwives data. 
18 
Five levels of disadvantage were 
assigned to census collection districts 
(∼200 households) ranging from 
1 (most disadvantaged) to 5 (least 
disadvantaged). Parents’ history of 
hospital discharges and contacts 
(pre- and post-birth) for mental 
health, substance-related issues, 
and assault-related injuries were 
ascertained from HMDS and the MHIS 
(1970–2010). The Mortality Register 
was used to censor observations at 
date of death.
The CPFS records provided data 
on children’s entire history of 
maltreatment allegations from birth 
onward, including age of allegation 
and type of maltreatment. Allegations 
consist of reports made to CPFS 
regarding alleged child abuse and 
neglect. An allegation is substantiated 
by CPFS when after investigation 
there is reasonable cause to believe 
the child has been, is being, or 
is likely to be abused, neglected, 
or otherwise harmed. After a 
substantiated allegation, children 
could be removed from their families 
and enter out-of-home care.
Statistical Analysis
In addition to descriptive analysis, 
Cox regression was used to estimate 
the adjusted and unadjusted hazard 
ratio (HR) and 95% confidence 
interval (CI) for the time in months 
from birth to first maltreatment 
allegation, adjusted for disability 
types and other risk factors. Results 
in which the 95% CIs did not include 
the null value of 1 were considered 
statistically significant. Records were 
censored at their date of death and 
if there was no child maltreatment 
allegation by the end of follow-up. 
The main analyses first assessed the 
HR for child maltreatment allegations 
by using a dichotomous disability 
covariate (disability versus no 
disability), and second by using 6 
dichotomous covariates (6 disability 
types) in addition to adjusting for 
child, family, and neighborhood risk 
factors. In the categorical disability 
analysis (6 disability groups), 
children with comorbidities could 
be categorized in >1 group (except 
DS) and analyzed accordingly. 
Further Cox regression analyses 
investigated time to a substantiated 
allegation and time to a period of 
out-of-home care. In our analyses, 
we assumed the values of these 
covariates were determined at the 
point when follow-up began on 
each child (time = 0; ie, at birth) and 
that these did not change over the 
period of observation. As we are not 
confident when diagnoses began, we 
did not add a time-varying covariate 
for disability and have stated this in 
the limitations. Additional analyses 
examined risk of allegations related 
to aspects of ID, including severity, 
comorbidity, cause, and the specific 
birth defects of spina bifida and cleft 
lip and/or palate. Further analyses 
also were conducted to investigate 
type of maltreatment allegation 
(neglect, physical and sexual abuse) 
for all disability groups and ID 
severity (Supplemental Information).
RESULTS
Risk of Allegations
Of the 524 534 children in the 
population cohort, 4.6% had a 
maltreatment allegation ( 
Table 2). 
Overall, 25.9% of child maltreatment 
allegations and 29.0% of 
substantiated allegations involved a 
child with a disability. Maltreatment 
allegations varied by disability type; 
children with ID comprised 6.7% 
allegations, similar to birth defects/
cerebral palsy (6.6%), and conduct

MACLEAN et al 
disorder (4.5%), with the largest 
number of allegations for children 
with mental/behavioral disorders 
(15.6%). Only a small proportion of 
allegations included children with DS 
(0.1%) or autism (0.7%).
Age at first maltreatment allegation 
was similar across disability types, 
with a mean age of 4.8 years, and 
fairly similar to children without 
disabilities (4.2 years). Type of 
maltreatment allegation also was 
similar across disability groups 
(neglect ∼25%, physical abuse 
∼24%, sexual abuse ∼19%, and 
emotional abuse ∼3.5%). This 
pattern was generally similar to 
children without disabilities, except 
proportions were slightly higher for 
neglect and physical abuse. The only 
groups that varied to a large degree 
were children with ID who had a 
higher proportion of neglect (33%) 
and children with conduct disorder 
who had more physical abuse (31%).
Before adjusting for child, family, 
and neighborhood characteristics, 
children with a disability had more 
than a twofold increased risk of 
having a maltreatment allegation 
(HR 2.64, 95% CI 2.56–2.74) and 
a threefold increased risk of a 
substantiated allegation (HR 3.09, 
95% CI 2.97–3.22) compared with 
children without a disability (see 
 
Table 3). All disability types other 
than DS were associated with a 
significantly increased risk for 
having a maltreatment allegation 
before adjustment. The highest HRs 
were for conduct disorder (HR 5.14, 
95% CI 4.83–5.47), followed by ID 
(HR 3.86, 95% CI 3.67–4.06) and 
mental/behavioral disorders (HR 
3.69, 95% CI 3.56–3.82). The risk 
of substantiated allegation also was 
higher.
Adjustment for Demographic and 
Psychosocial Characteristics
As shown in the Supplemental Tables, 
demographic and psychosocial 
characteristics vary across disability 
type. Accounting for child, family, and 
neighborhood risk factors partially 
attenuated the relationship between 
disabilities and maltreatment, 
particularly for conduct disorder 
and mental/behavioral disorders, 
and changed the relationship for 
autism from increased to decreased 
risk ( 
Table 3). After controlling for 
other risk factors, children with a 
disability still had an increased risk 
of maltreatment allegations (HR 1.74, 
95% CI 1.68–1.80) and substantiated 
allegations (HR 1.89, 95% CI 
1.80–1.98) compared with children 
without disabilities.
Risk was highest for children with 
IDs (HR 2.14, 95% CI 2.00–2.28), 
followed by conduct disorder and 
mental/behavioral disorders. 
There was significantly lower risk 
of maltreatment allegations for 
children with autism (HR 0.74, 95% 
CI 0.63–0.89), and children with DS 
also had lower risk, although did not 
reach significance (HR 0.69, 95% 
CI 0.46–1.02). Risk of maltreatment 
allegations did not differ between 
children with birth defects/
cerebral palsy and children with no 
disabilities (HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.93–
1.05), although they had a slightly 
elevated risk of a substantiated 
allegation (HR 1.10, 95% CI 1.01–
1.20) and entering out-of-home care 
(HR 1.32, 95% CI 1.18–1.49, see 
Supplemental Information). Analysis 
by type of maltreatment allegation 
found relatively consistent results, 
with the exception of maltreatment 
involving sexual abuse, in which 
autism was protective and birth 
defects/cerebral palsy showed no 
increased risk. However, caution 
should be taken when interpreting 
results due to smaller sample sizes 
and therefore unreliable estimates 
(Supplemental Information).
Supplementary multivariate analysis 
of spina bifida and cleft lip and/
or palate was conducted, finding 
an increased risk of substantiated 
allegation in the univariate analysis 
(HR 1.94, 95% CI 1.01–3.72; HR 1.61, 
95% CI 1.01–2.56, respectively), but 
after adjustment found no increased 
risk (HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.33–1.65; HR 
0.81, 95% CI 0.42–1.55, respectively). 
Caution should be taken with this 
finding due to small sample size.
Aboriginal children had an increased 
risk of a maltreatment allegation of 
almost 6.5 times compared with non-
Aboriginal children; however, this 
risk dropped to 1.64 (95% CI 1.57–
1.70) once other factors were taken 
into account, particularly as they 
had a higher risk of other family and 
social risk factors. The proportion of 
Aboriginal children with disability 
was 14.2%, compared with 10.1% 
for non-Aboriginal children. They 
had a higher proportion of children 
with ID (3.2% vs 1.5%) and mental/
behavioral disorder (17.5% versus 
14.3%), both of which had higher 
risks of maltreatment allegations.
Severity and Cause of ID
For children with ID, less severe 
disability was related to increased 
likelihood of maltreatment 
allegations ( 
Table 4). After 
controlling for other risk factors, 
children with borderline-mild ID 
had an almost threefold increased 
likelihood of maltreatment 
allegations (HR 2.73, 95% CI 
2.45–3.04), and children with 
mild-moderate ID were at twofold 
increased likelihood of allegations 
(HR 2.01, 95% CI 1.85–2.17). The 
risk associated with severe ID did 
not differ significantly from children 
without ID (HR 1.30, 95% CI 0.95–
1.79). When broken down by type of 
maltreatment allegation, the findings 
were relatively consistent except 
that for children with severe ID, they 
were at increased risk of neglect 
(Supplemental Information).
Among children with ID, a 
supplementary analysis found an 
increased maltreatment risk for 
children for whom the recorded 
cause of disability was postnatal 
injury (HR 5.14, 95% CI 2.99–8.83), 
prenatal exposure to alcohol (HR 
2.01, 95% CI 1.30–3.11), other birth

defects (HR 9.49, 95% CI 2.20–
41.06), and cultural-familial (HR 4.13, 
95% CI 3.01–5.66).
Comorbidity
Comorbidity was common. Of 
the 8551 children with ID, 5350 
(62.6%) also have at least 1 of the 
following: birth defect/cerebral 
palsy, autism, conduct disorder, or 
a mental/behavioral diagnosis. The 
presence of comorbid ID significantly 
increased the likelihood of having 
a maltreatment allegation for 
children with birth defect/cerebral 
palsy, autism, or mental health 
and behavioral disorders ( 
Table 
5). Children with autism but no ID 
showed a nonsignificant increased 
risk, probably due to volatility of 
estimates due to small numbers.
DISCUSSION
Children with disabilities make 
up 10.4% of the WA population; 
however, they account for 1 in 4 
maltreatment allegations and 1 in 
3 substantiated allegations. This 
disproportionate representation 
of children with disabilities in 
maltreatment allegations are 
consistent with international 
findings. 
9 Importantly, the increased 
risk of maltreatment allegations was 
not consistent across all disability 
types. Overrepresented groups 
included children with ID, conduct 
disorder, and mental/behavioral 
disorders.
Previous studies have included 
various disability types, but there is 
no consistent method for defining 
and grouping disability types, which 
reduces comparability. Also, different 
countries may have different 
thresholds and processes around 
child maltreatment allegations, 
which reduces comparability. 
Nevertheless, comparisons with 
previous studies shed light on some 
consistent findings. Unadjusted 
results show significantly elevated 
risk of allegations for all disability

threefold increased risk of allegations

conduct disorder, and ID. After 
adjusting for risk factors, children 
with ID, mental/behavioral problems,

In contrast, after adjustment, children 
with autism, DS, and birth defects/
cerebral palsy showed no increased 
risk for an allegation; however, 
for substantiated maltreatment, 
children with birth defects/cerebral 
palsy had a slightly increased risk, 
which just reached significance. 
Our results of no increased risk for 
autism and DS are consistent with 
previous research despite different 
lengths of follow-up.

9 However, 
our finding of no increased risk for 
spina bifida or cleft lip and/or palate 
after adjustment was the opposite of 
previous findings. 
15
Possible explanations for the lower 
risk for children with DS and autism 
include that these disabilities are 
comparatively well recognized, 
understood, and supported. 
Parents tended to be older, better 
off socioeconomically, and for DS, 
the ready availability of prenatal 
screening in WA means most parents 
have had the opportunity for prenatal 
diagnosis and the choice to continue 
with the pregnancy. 
19
We cannot specifically address the 
directionality of maltreatment and 
disability in our study. However, 
the stronger relationship between 
disability types that could be 
caused by or share a pathway with 
maltreatment is consistent with 
studies that found the relationship 
with maltreatment was stronger 
(eg, Sullivan and Knutson 
9) or 
present (eg, Spencer et al 
4) only for 
disabilities such as conduct disorder, 
mental/behavioral problems, and 
ID. Together with our examination 
of the recorded cause of ID, finding 
increased risk for postnatal injury, 
prenatal exposure to alcohol, and 
cultural-familial causes lends 
further support to this. As an 
example of potential complexities, 
the case of maternal alcohol use 
during pregnancy (causing ID) and 
continuing after birth may affect 
parenting a child with complex 
needs resulting in child protection 
involvement. This should be 
examined in future research.
Regardless of causality, the disability 
types most strongly associated with 
maltreatment often cooccurred with 
a constellation of other risk factors, 
such as parents who are young or 
who have been hospitalized for 
mental health or substance use, 
and living in more disadvantaged 
neighborhoods. These families 
already face additional stressors 
and have fewer resources to access 
services for their children’s special 
needs.
The inverse relationship 
between severity of ID and risk 
of maltreatment is consistent 
with other research. 
3 It has been 
suggested that where children’s 
disabilities are more profound, 
parents may have more realistic 
expectations, or children may be 
less able to function in ways that 
are provocative (eg, talking back). 
Furthermore, clustering of mild ID 
within families is relatively common, 
and linked to socioeconomic 
disadvantage. 
20 In combination with 
our finding that ID with cultural-
familial causes was associated with 
increased maltreatment, it may be 
that a number of children with mild 
ID are more likely to experience 
maltreatment because they have 
a higher-risk family profile. It is 
important that qualitative research 
investigates further factors that may 
increase risk and identify support 
strategies and interventions that may 
assist families.
The relationship between disability 
and child maltreatment was partially 
attenuated after adjusting for 
demographic and psychosocial risk 
factors. These findings indicate that 
disability is an important risk factor

for maltreatment, but not all disabled 
children should be considered at 
increased risk, and that other risk 
factors at the child, family, and 
neighborhood levels also play an 
important role. From our analyses, 
socioeconomic disadvantage, teenage 
parents, maternal mental health, 
and substance use admissions were 
strong risk factors for maltreatment. 
Factors at these different levels need 
to be considered when assessing the 
needs of families to ameliorate risks.
Although the use of administrative 
data allows complete case 
ascertainment of children with 
maltreatment allegations from 
birth onward in WA, it does have 
limitations. Obviously, maltreatment 
will be included only if it is reported. 
Although we have comprehensively 
ascertained disability from a number 
of population-level data sources, not 
all children with disabilities will be 
identified. Comorbidities also will 
be underascertained, as the MHIS 
captures only 1 diagnosis. During 
the study period, it is expected 
that there would be changes in the 
prevalence of diagnoses over time, 
which would have affected the 
prevalence of ICD codes. For example, 
previous research found a rise in 
the prevalence of autism diagnoses 
in 1994 with the introduction of the 
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 
of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, 
and in 1997 with the formalization 
of assessment procedures. 
21 In 
addition, a number of important 
variables could not be obtained 
using our data, including the child’s 
level of functioning, age of diagnosis, 
type and amount of support services 
families are receiving, family 
functioning, and parents’ own 
disability status. The other issue is 
the timing of the onset of disability/
condition in relation to maltreatment 
to provide further evidence of 
directionality, whether maltreatment 
may be a cause for some conditions 
(eg, conduct disorder) or contributes 
as a risk factor to maltreatment. We 
also cannot rule out that children 
with disabilities are likely to have 
increased service use; therefore, 
higher scrutiny and increased 
likelihood to be reported for 
maltreatment, which should be 
considered in future research.
The prevalence of disabilities in 
the child protection population 
suggests the need for awareness 
by agencies of the scope of issues 
faced by children in the system and 
interagency collaboration to ensure 
children’s complex needs are met. 
In addition, supports are needed for 
families of children with disabilities 
not only to assist in meeting the 
child’s health and developmental 
needs, but also to support parents in 
managing the often more complex 
parenting environment, including 
dealing with challenging behavior. 
Research indicates that family-
centered care with coordination 
of services, continuity of care, and 
respite care are important factors 
in reducing child protection risk. 
22, 
 
23 As signatories to the United 
Nations Conventions on the Rights 
of the Child and Rights of Persons 
with Disabilities, governments 
have committed to assist parents 
in the performance of their child-
rearing responsibilities, and that 
persons with disabilities and their 
family members should receive 
the necessary assistance to enable 
families to contribute toward the 
full and equal enjoyment of the 
rights of persons with disabilities. 
This highlights the important role 
governments and society have 
in ensuring that children with 
disabilities and their families have 
the appropriate services and support 
structures in place to enable them 
to achieve their full potential and 
ensure their well-being.
