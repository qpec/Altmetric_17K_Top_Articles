INTRODUCTION: Inhibitory interneurons
balance the excitation and inhibition of neu-
ral networks and therefore are key to normal
brain function. In the developing brain, young
interneurons migrate from their sites of birth
into distant locations, where they functionally
integrate. Although this neuronal migration is
largely complete before birth, some young in-
hibitory interneurons continue to travel and
add to circuits in restricted regions of the juve-
nile and adult mammalian brain. For example,
postnatally migrating inhibitory neurons travel
from the walls of the lateral ventricle, along
the rostral migratory stream (RMS) into the
olfactory bulb. In humans, an additional ven-
tral route branching off the RMS, the medial
migratory stream (MMS), takes young neu-
rons into the medial prefrontal cortex. It has
been suggested that recruitment of neurons
during postnatal life could help shape neural
circuits according to experience. Specifically, in-
hibitory interneuron maturation during post-
natal development is associated with critical
periods of brain plasticity. We asked whether
neuronal recruitment continues into early child-
hood in the frontal lobe, a region of the human
brain that has greatly increased in size and
complexity during evolution.
RATIONALE: Migrating young neurons per-
sist for several months after birth in an exten-
sive region of the subventricular zone (SVZ)
around the anterior lateral ventricles in the hu-
man brain. Are all these young neurons migrat-
ing into the RMS and MMS, or do they have
other destinations? Using high-resolution mag-
netic resonance imaging (MRI), histology, and
time-lapse confocal microscopy, we observed
the migration of many young inhibitory inter-
neurons around the dorsal anterior walls of
the lateral ventricle and into multiple cortical
regions of the human frontal cortex. We deter-
mined the location and orientation of these
young neurons, demonstrated their active
translocation, and inferred their fates in the
postnatal anterior forebrain.
RESULTS: A large collection of cells express-
ing doublecortin (DCX), a marker of young
migrating neurons, traveled and integrated
within the infant frontal lobe. This migratory
stream, which was most prominent during
the first 2 months after
birth and persisted until
at least 5 months, formed
a caplike structure sur-
rounding the anterior body
of the lateral ventricle. We
refer to this population
of young neurons as the Arc. This structure
could also be visualized by brain MRI. Young
neurons in the Arc appeared to move long dis-
tances in distinct regions around the ventricu-
lar wall and the developing white matter. The
orientation of elongated DCX+ cells suggested
that migratory neurons closer to the ventricular
wall dispersed tangentially. In contrast, migra-
tory neurons within the developing white matter
tended to be orientated toward the overlying
cortex. These cells expressed markers of inter-
neurons, and their entry into the anterior cin-
gulate cortex (a major target of the Arc used for
quantification) was correlated with the emer-
gence of specific subtypes of g-aminobutyric acid
(GABA)–expressing interneurons (neuropeptide
Y, somatostatin, calretinin, and calbindin). Ex-
pression of transcription factors associated with
specific sites of origin suggested that these neu-
rons arise from ventral telencephalon progeni-
tor domains.
CONCLUSION: Widespread neuronal migra-
tion into the human frontal lobe continues
for several months after birth. Young neurons
express markers of cortical inhibitory inter-
neurons and originate outside the cortex, likely
in the ventral forebrain. The postnatal recruit-
ment of large populations of inhibitory neurons
may contribute to maturation and plasticity
in the human frontal cortex. Defects in the
migration of these neurons could result in cir-
cuit dysfunctions associated with neurodevel-
opmental disorders.▪

Extensive migration of young neurons
into the infant human frontal lobe

The first few months after birth,when a child begins to interact with the environment, are critical
to human brain development.The human frontal lobe is important for social behavior and
executive function; it has increased in size and complexity relative to other species, but the
processes that have contributed to this expansion are unknown. Our studies of postmortem
infant human brains revealed a collection of neurons that migrate and integrate widely into the
frontal lobe during infancy. Chains of young neurons move tangentially close to the walls of
the lateral ventricles and along blood vessels.These cells then individually disperse long
distances to reach cortical tissue, where they differentiate and contribute to inhibitory circuits.
Late-arriving interneurons could contribute to developmental plasticity, and the disruption
of their postnatal migration or differentiation may underlie neurodevelopmental disorders.
L
ocal inhibitory interneurons in the cerebral
cortex play key roles in the final assembly
of brain circuits, and their maturation is
essential to critical-period plasticity and
learning (1, 2). Interneurons are born in
ventral progenitor zones, primarily the medial
and caudal ganglionic eminences (MGE and
CGE), and then migrate dorsally to reach the ce-
rebral cortex (3–7). Neuronal migration is largely
completed during fetal development (8, 9). How-
ever, in many species, migrating young neurons
persist in the postnatal subventricular zone (SVZ)
of the lateral ventricles (10, 11). In rodents, SVZ-
derived neurons migrate along the rostral migra-
tory stream (RMS) into the olfactory bulb, where
they replace neurons throughout life (12–15). A
small number of these neurons, born perinatally,
migrate into the anterior forebrain to become
small axonless neurons (16, 17) or into the ven-
tral forebrain to become granule cells in the
islands of Calleja (18). In the infant human brain,
SVZ-derived young neurons migrate along the
RMS (19, 20) into the olfactory bulb, and a sub-
population of these cells migrates along a medial
migratory stream (MMS) into the ventral medial
prefrontal cortex (20). The postnatal human SVZ
extends dorsally, but it is not known whether
cells in this region also contribute to other areas
of the human forebrain. Given the tremendous
postnatal growth of the human frontal lobe and
the prevalence of migrating young neurons in
the adjacent SVZ, we investigated whether neu-
rons also continue migrating into the frontal
lobe of infants and young children.
Postnatal migratory pathways
into the frontal lobes
In samples from the anterior forebrain of chil-
dren younger than 3 months of age, regions of
high cell densities were observed in the SVZ.

 These densities were adjacent to the anterior
body of the lateral ventricle and within the neigh-
boring subcortical white matter, forming a dis-
tinct arching structure in sagittal sections or an
eyebrow-shaped extension in coronal sections
(Fig. 1, A and D, black arrows). The majority of
cells within these regions coexpressed double-
cortin (DCX) and polysialylated neural cell ad-
hesion molecule (PSA-NCAM), markers of young
migrating neurons (Fig. 1, B, C, and E, and fig.
S1B) (21, 22). Many of these cells displayed mi-
gratory morphology, with an elongated cell body
and a leading process that was occasionally bi-
furcated (23–25). DCX+ cells did not express Olig2
(see below), which marks oligodendrocytes and
their precursor cells, nor the astrocytic markers
glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and Aldh1L1
(fig. S1 and fig. S2, K and L).
In postmortem brains collected at birth and
at 1 month, these putative migrating young neu-
rons were organized into four layers, or tiers,
around the anterior body of the lateral ventri-
cles (Fig. 1, J and K, and fig. S1F). Tier 1 corre-
sponded to a cell-dense SVZ band of DCX+ cells
next to the walls of the lateral ventricle; between
6 and 12 months, tier 1 is depleted of young neu-
rons, becoming a hypocellular gap layer (20).
Tier 2 contained a more dispersed collection of
DCX+ cells. Tier 3 was an intermediate region
with many DCX+ cells within clusters, frequently
around blood vessels, and dispersed DCX+ cells
around these clusters (fig. S3). Tier 4 contained
a group of DCX+ cells dispersed within areas of
the developing white matter. Many cells in tier 4
were organized around radial finger-like exten-
sions of triangular shape (Fig. 1B, yellow arrows).
We analyzed these tiered regions in 1-day-old
and 28-day-old brains by electron microscopy.
Cells with the ultrastructure of young migrating
neurons were found throughout tiers 1 to 4. Mig-
rating young neurons were organized as chains
(12) or as individual cells (Fig. 2, A to D, and fig.
S4, C and G). Those within chains had adherent
junctions similar to those observed in the RMS
(fig. S4, G and H). Confocal and electron micro-
scopy showed that chains of migrating neurons
were flanked by cells rich in intermediate filaments
containing GFAP (Fig. 2F, fig. S1C, and movie S1).
To generate a multiplanar representation of mi-
gratory streams of cells, we used high-resolution
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to image
intact hemispheres from postmortem human
brains between birth and 2 months of age, in-
cluding a premature case born at 34 gestational
weeks (GW) (table S1). MRI analysis revealed a
T2 hyperintense signal adjacent to the anterior
horn of the lateral ventricle (fig. S5, A and B, red
shading). Three-dimensional rendering of the
segmented areas of T2 signal in brains at 34 GW
and at birth showed that this structure formed
a cap around the anterior horn of the lateral
ventricle (fig. S5D). In sagittal MRI planes, this
cap structure had an arc shape (fig. S5, A and G),
running parallel to the anterior cingulate cortex
and extending caudally to approximately the
level of the central sulcus. This arc was also ob-
served in live MRI images of the developing
human brain (fig. S5, H and I). The T2 hyper-
intense signal was localized to ventricular re-
gions densely populated by DCX+ cells (fig. S1, E
to G). Given the organization we observed in
both histological and radiographic images, we
refer to these streams of cells as the “Arc.”
Migratory features of young neurons
in the human infant brain
To confirm that these cells were in fact actively
migrating, we obtained human neonatal brain
samples (table S1) with short postmortem in-
tervals and infected them with adenovirus carry-
ing green fluorescent protein (adenoGFP) for
time-lapse confocal microscopy. Elongated GFP+
cells (n = 18) with leading processes were iden-
tified, and we studied their behavior for 24 to
48 hours (Fig. 3C). As shown (movies S2 and
S3), these cells actively migrated in coronal and
sagittal slice cultures, displaying leading process
extension, nucleokinesis, and retraction of trail-
ing process. These features were indistinguishable
from the migratory behavior of neurons in the

 fetal brain (24, 26, 27). Active migration was also
observed within clusters of cells (movies S3 and
S4) at the dorsolateral ventricular edge, but be-
cause of their high cellular density, the behavior
of individual cells was often not evident. In one of
these clusters, we captured a labeled cell escaping
the cluster to begin individual migration (movie
S4). Immunostaining of these brain slices after
time-lapse imaging confirmed that the migrating
cells were DCX+ (Fig. 3B). Thus, neurons in the
newborn brain within the Arc and immediate
surroundings are actively migrating.
Using fixed tissue, we inferred possible migra-
tory trajectories from the orientation of the lead-
ing process of DCX+ young neurons. We defined
a vector from the center of the cell body in the
direction of the leading process (see supplemen-
tary materials). We applied this analysis to DCX+
cells in coronal and sagittal sections at birth
and 1.5 months of age in periventricular and
subcortical white matter regions in the frontal
lobe (Fig. 3, D and E). We observed that the
vector orientation of the cells changed depend-
ing on the region. The leading process of DCX+
cells could not be discerned in tier 1 because of
the high cellular density, but the majority of cells
in tier 2 appeared to be migrating tangentially,
parallel to the ventricle wall. In the sagittal plane,
cells were oriented ventrally and dorsally. In tier 3,
the orientation remained largely tangential, but
cellular direction was more variable than in tier
2. Lastly, in tier 4 and at the gray matter–white
matter junction, more cells were oriented toward
the developing cortex (Fig. 3, D and E, and figs.
S6 and S7). A similar pattern of vector orienta-
tion was also observed in the coronal plane of
the frontal lobe at 1.5 months (fig. S8). These data
suggest that young neurons in regions close to
the ventricles primarily migrate in the tangential
plane, whereas those in tiers 3 and 4, and in the
developing white matter and cortex, are more
widespread and cortically directed.
We next mapped the distribution of young
migratory neurons adjacent to the ventricular
wall and in the overlying cortices at birth and

 at 1.5, 3, 5, and 7 months. At and immediately
after birth, elongated DCX+ cells were found
at the dorsal ventricular wall and in the man-
tle region of the developing white matter (Fig.
3F). By 1.5 months, DCX+ cells were mainly found
in the dorsal cortex in the superior and middle
frontal gyri and the cingulate cortex, but many
remained in the developing white matter. The
total number of DCX+ cells with migratory mor-
phology decreased between 1.5 and 7 months
of age (Fig. 3, F and G; for representative DCX+
cells at 5 and 7 months, see fig. S9). The entry
of DCX+ cells into the anterior cingulate gyrus
was correlated with an increase in the number
of cells expressing NeuN, a marker of mature
neurons (fig. S10B). We also examined the cin-
gulate cortex at 2, 6, and 15 years of age. Four
to six DCX+ cells were observed per section
in the 2-year-old sample, but these cells did
not have a clear migratory morphology. None
were detected at 6 or 15 years. Sagittal sections
mapped at birth also demonstrated migrating
young neurons moving into the anterior pole
of the developing human brain (fig. S11). These
observations indicate that postnatal neuronal
migration in the human frontal lobe, in the Arc
and beyond, occurs primarily within the first
3 months after birth, with a few DCX+ elongated
cells persisting at 7 months.
Postnatally migrating neurons
differentiate into interneurons
We sought to determine which types of neu-
rons the DCX+ cells in the Arc become. DCX+
cells in all tiers at birth and at 1.5 months ex-
pressed g-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the main
inhibitory neurotransmitter in the adult brain;
GAD67, an enzyme involved in the production
of GABA; and the chemokine receptor CXCR4,
seen in migrating interneurons (Fig. 4, B to D).
Within tiers 1 and 2 (close to the ventricular wall),
92.5 ± 2.9% (SD) of DCX+ cells were GAD67+ and
96.1 ± 2.4% were GABA+. Farther away, within
tiers 3 and 4, 91.2 ± 4.4% of DCX+ cells were
GAD67+ and 94.8 ± 5.8% were GABA+. Because
cortical interneurons primarily arise from the
MGE and CGE (3, 5, 19, 22), we asked whether
DCX+ cells in the Arc expressed Nkx2.1 or Lhx6
(transcription factors associated with the MGE),
or Sp8 and COUP-TFII [associated with the
CGE and possibly the lateral ganglionic emi-
nence (LGE)]. At birth, about 10% of DCX+ cells
were Nkx2.1+ and 28% were Lhx6+ (Fig. 4, G to
I, and fig. S2, F and G). Sp8 and COUP-TFII
were expressed in 24% and 22% of DCX+ cells,
respectively (Fig. 4, E, F, and I, and fig. S2, D
and E). DCX+ cells did not express Sox2 or Tbr2,
transcription factors associated with early and
intermediate progenitor cells, respectively (Fig.
4K and fig. S2), nor did they express Emx1,
CTIP2, or SATB2, transcription factors associ-
ated with excitatory neurons (fig. S2). In tiers
1 to 4 at birth, we found very few cells positive
for Ki67, a marker of proliferating cells (fig.
S12). Most of these Ki67+ cells were also Olig2+
and none were DCX+. Thus, DCX+ cells in the

Fig. 6. Migratory streams of young neurons in the frontal lobe of the
early postnatal human brain. In the frontal lobe of the neonatal human
brain, cut in sagittal and coronal planes in this schematic, large numbers of
young migrating neurons persist (shown in green) (see Figs. 1 to 3). Multiple
concentric tiers of migrating cells are observed around the anterior pole
of the lateral ventricle (see Fig. 1). Close to the ventricular wall, migrating
young neurons are largely oriented tangentially; dense subpopulations are
also clustered around blood vessels (red). Farther out, young neurons are
more dispersed, many now oriented radially; they appear to migrate long
distances through the developing white matter to reach the cortex. Ven-
trally, we also illustrate the RMS and the MMS, which target the olfactory
bulb and medial prefrontal cortex, respectively (20).

 postnatal frontal lobe correspond to postmitotic
migrating young inhibitory interneurons, likely
derived from the developing ganglionic eminences
(CGE, MGE, and possibly LGE).
The interneuron subtype composition
in the anterior cingulate cortex
changes postnatally
To address how the Arc might contribute to
developing cortical circuits, we mapped and
quantified the total number of cells, neurons,
and interneuron subtypes from birth until adult-
hood. We focused on the anterior cingulate cortex,
which runs parallel to the Arc and had many
DCX+ cells during the first postnatal months.
The cell number and volume of the cingulate
cortex increased between birth and 5 months
of age (fig. S10, A and C). The neuronal popula-
tion in the cingulate cortex, as identified by NeuN
expression, also increased during this time. These
population changes followed the peak in the total
number of DCX+ cells, at ~1.5 months, suggesting
that the cingulate cortex receives young migra-
tory neurons up to 5 months after birth. Most
DCX+ cells found postnatally in the cingulate
cortex white matter expressed GAD67, and a
subpopulation expressed interneuron subtype
markers [neuropeptide Y (NPY), somatostatin
(SST), calretinin (CalR), or calbindin (CalB)] (Fig.
5, A to E). If these different subtypes of migrating
young neurons enter the cingulate cortex, we
hypothesized that its interneuron subtype com-
position would change over time. Indeed, by
quantifying the abundance of different inter-
neuron subtypes in this region, we found that
the number of cells expressing NPY, SST, CalR,
and CalB increased during the first 5 months
after birth (Fig. 5, F and G). The number of
parvalbumin-expressing cells also changed with
age (from ~20,000 cells per cingulate segment at
3 months to >72,000 cells at 24 years), but we
do not know whether this increase is due to cell
addition or due to their late maturation (28, 29).
These data suggest that DCX+ cells from the Arc
contribute to interneuron subtype populations
within the infant cingulate cortex.
Discussion
We have identified a large, heterogeneous pop-
ulation of late-migrating neurons in the infant
human brain that targets an extensive region of
the anterior forebrain, including the cingulate
gyrus and prefrontal cortex. In the rodent cortex,
a population of CGE-derived young migrating
neurons continues to migrate into the cortex with-
in the first few weeks of postnatal life (16, 17, 30).
The population of young migrating neurons in
the frontal lobe of postnatal humans appears to
include this population but also others, including
SST, NPY, and CalB. This assortment of subtypes,
along with the expression of the regionally specific
transcription factors Nkx2.1, Lhx6, COUP-TFII,
and SP8, suggests that cells within the Arc derive
from various progenitor zones in the ventral fore-
brain. The extensive tangential migration in the
SVZ and perivascular region of the infant brain
(Fig. 6 and movie S5) could allow for mixed
populations of interneurons from distinct pro-
genitor zones (31) to reach appropriate corti-
cal regions. The precise time and birthplace of
young migrating neurons within the postnatal
human frontal lobe remains to be determined.
Because migrating neurons from the Arc reach
cortical circuits during postnatal life, sensory
experience could shape their recruitment and
possibly their connectivity (32–36). Periods of
plasticity are tightly linked to the time course
of inhibitory interneuron maturation; thus, the
late incorporation of inhibitory neurons into
the frontal cortex could also be associated with
the extension and delay in periods of plasticity
during postnatal human development (37–39).
Given the large numbers of young neurons that
continue to migrate in the human brain at birth
and during the first few months of life, injuries
during this time (e.g., hypoxic ischemia) could
affect neuronal recruitment from the Arc (40, 41)
and may contribute to sensorimotor handicaps
and neurocognitive deficits, including those seen
in epilepsy, cerebral palsy, and autism spectrum
disorders (42, 43).
