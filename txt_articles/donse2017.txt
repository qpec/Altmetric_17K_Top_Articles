Background: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is considered an efficacious non-
invasive neuromodulation treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD). However, little is known
about the clinical outcome of combined rTMS and psychotherapy (rTMS þ PT). Through common
neurobiological brain mechanisms, rTMS þ PT may exert enhanced antidepressant effects compared to
the respective monotherapies.
Objective: The current naturalistic study aimed to evaluate feasibility and clinical outcome of rTMS þ PT
in a large group of MDD patients. The second aim was to identify clinical predictors of response and
remission.
Methods: A total of 196 patients with MDD were treated with at least 10 sessions of simultaneous rTMS
and PT. rTMS was applied over the DLPFC, either 10 Hz left or 1 Hz right. Psychotherapy was based on
principles of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Symptoms were measured using the BDI each fifth
session until end of treatment and at 6-month follow-up. Comparisons were made between responders
and non-responders, as well as between the 10 Hz and 1 Hz protocol. Additionally, baseline variables and
early BDI change were evaluated as predictors of response/remission.
Major findings and conclusions: 1) Combining rTMS and PT resulted in a 66% response and a 56%
remission rate at the end of treatment with 60% sustained remission at follow-up. Compared to previous
findings in RCTs, these rates are relatively high; 2) No differences were found between the 10 Hz and 1 Hz
TMS regarding clinical outcome; 3) Clinical baseline variables were not predictive of treatment out-
comes; 4) Early symptom improvement (at session 10) was highly predictive of response, and may
therefore be used to guide rTMS þ PT continuation; 5) Based on the current findings in a large natu-
ralistic study, future studies employing a more standardized method are warranted to draw solid con-
clusions on the unique effect of rTMS þ PT.

Introduction
The application of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation
(rTMS) in major depressive disorder (MDD) as an augmentation
treatment strategy for treatment-resistant patients has been
extensively investigated in the past decades. In rTMS, a magnetic
coil is placed on a specific location on the scalp to modify target
brain networks by applying magnetic pulses, inducing an electrical
current in underlying cortex [1]. The efficacy of rTMS over the
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) has been established in large
multicenter randomized controlled trials (RCTs) [2,3] and meta-
analyses [4e7], and is considered an evidence-based treatment

 approach for MDD [8]. A few studies have investigated the gener-
alizability of the effects of rTMS in clinical settings. In a multisite
observational study, the response rate in the short term was com-
parable to those in research populations [9], and a 1-year follow-up
study of the same population demonstrated that these effects
remained similar in the long term [10]. These studies highlight the
clinical significance of rTMS for the treatment of MDD patients.
Currently, rTMS is usually applied either as monotherapy or as
augmentation to pharmacotherapy. Although response to this
approach is better than sham in RCTs, a large proportion of patients
does not respond [5]. It is therefore important to seek optimization
of the treatment protocol.
The effects of rTMS are exerted through modulating network
connectivity [1]. MDD is associated with dysregulation of medial/
orbitofrontal networks, including the default mode network (DMN),
central executive network (CEN) and salience network (SN) [11,12]. In
these networks, hyperconnectivity between prefrontal and anterior
cingulate regions is associated with symptoms of MDD, such as
rumination and negative bias [13]. Numerous studies have shown
that connectivity from the DLPFC to the anterior cingulate cortex
(ACC) changes as a result of rTMS [14]. Similarly, symptom changes
as a result of psychotherapy (PT) are associated with changes in
functional connectivity in fronto-limbic and fronto-cingulate cir-
cuitry, particularly from the medial PFC to the ACC and the amygdala
[15]. Thus, both rTMS and PT are targeting the same networks
through different pathways, inducing changes through neuro-
plasticity [16,17]. These observations give rise to the question
whether simultaneous application of rTMS and PT (rTMS þ PT) could
lead to more robust and prolonged antidepressant effects.
Such an enhanced
effect has been observed in studies
combining PT with pharmacotherapy [18,19] and rTMS with
pharmacotherapy [20]. Even stronger additive effects may be ex-
pected from rTMS þ PT, as both target network plasticity in a
similar way through different pathways. Furthermore, PT may be a
preferable add-on strategy to rTMS, as it is desirable for many
patients to quit medication. The main disadvantages of pharma-
cological treatment consist of undesirable side effects, cumulative
drop-out rates, and non-response in a significant proportion of the
patients, as demonstrated in the systematic antidepressant
treatment of STAR*D [21]. Moreover, psychotherapy is often better
tolerated as a next-step treatment than medication augmentation
and switch strategies [22]. Although psychotherapy and medica-
tion are equally effective in the short term, follow-up outcomes
are favorable for psychotherapy [18,19,23]. It may therefore be
hypothesized that a combination of rTMS and PT could lead to
stronger and longer lasting effects, using a well-tolerated treat-
ment approach.
Moreover,
non-invasive
brain
stimulation
techniques
including rTMS exert effects on cognitive functions that psy-
chotherapy may rely on, such as explicit learning or top-down
emotional control [24]. In neurorehabilitation, combined appli-
cation of rTMS and cognitive rehabilitation therapies has been
shown to result in beneficial effects [25], mainly in the motor
[26] and language domain [27,28] as well as unilateral neglect
[29]. A similar effect may apply to the behavioral effect of
rTMS þ PT in psychiatry. Indeed, a case report demonstrated that
combined rTMS and CBT is feasible and possibly more effective
than either treatment alone [30], supporting this hypothesis, but
no other studies to date have reported on the clinical outcome of
this promising approach.
Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the feasibility
and clinical outcome of the simultaneous application of rTMS þ PT
in a large, representative population of MDD patients. The second
aim was to identify possible predictors of treatment outcome.
Method
Design and participants
The current study was a naturalistic open-label study. All pa-
tients enrolled at three outpatient mental health care clinics
(neuroCare Clinic Nijmegen, neuroCare Clinic The Hague, and Psy-
chologenpraktijk Timmers Oosterhout) between May 2007 and
November 2016 were screened for inclusion. Inclusion criteria were
1) a primary diagnosis of non-psychotic MDD or dysthymia, 2)
BDI�14 at baseline, 3) treatment with at least 10 sessions of rTMS
over the DLPFC or response within these 10 sessions, and 4)
informed consent. Exclusion criteria to ensure safety for rTMS were
previous ECT treatment, epilepsy, traumatic brain injury, current
psychotic disorder, wearing a cardiac pacemaker or metal parts in
the head, and current pregnancy.
Treatment procedure
Prior to treatment, patients completed an intake procedure,
including a structured clinical interview (MINI International
Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI)) [31] for the diagnosis of MDD
or dysthymia; if the MINI could not be completed due to time limits,
patients with a diagnosis in accordance with DSM-IV or DSM-5
criteria obtained elsewhere were considered eligible for treat-
ment as well. In addition, EEG was used to rule out contraindica-
tions for rTMS.
All patients were treated with either a high frequency (HF)
protocol over the left DLPFC or a low frequency (LF) protocol over
the right DLPFC, or both sequentially. rTMS was performed using a
Magstim Rapid2 (Magstim Company, Spring Gardens, UK) or a
Deymed DuoMag XT-100 stimulator with a figure-of-8 coil, 70 mm
diameter. For the HF protocol, rTMS was administered at 10 Hz over
the left DLPFC, 110e120% of the resting motor threshold (MT), 30
trains of 5s duration, inter-train interval (ITI) 30s, 1500 pulses per
session. The LF protocol consisted of rTMS at 1 Hz over the right
DLPFC, 110e120% MT, 120 trains of 10s duration, ITI 1s, 1200 pulses
per session. In case of both protocols, the LF protocol was admin-
istered first with a shorter duration of 1000 pulses per session and
subsequently the HF protocol at full length. The DLPFC was local-
ized using either the 5-cm rule or the Beam F3/F4 method (see
Ref. [32] for details).
Furthermore, rTMS treatment was complemented with psy-
chotherapy by a psychologist trained in both rTMS and CBT. The
therapist performed psychotherapy while the rTMS protocol was
running (as shown in Fig. 1). Psychotherapy always consisted of
evidence-based methods, mainly cognitive-behavioral therapy
(CBT) [33,34], but the specific approach was tailored to the clinical
needs of the patient, according to a decision procedure as usual in
mental health care, in some cases including other evidence-based
techniques indicated for comorbidities such as schema therapy or
EMDR. Each treatment session had a total duration of 45 min. An
rTMS protocol lasted 20 min, but psychotherapy was continued
until 45 min. Sessions took place with a minimum frequency of two
to three times per week and a maximum frequency of two per day.
The total number of sessions was guided by clinical decisions
and thus varied for each individual patient. Decisions to continue
treatment were based on response to treatment (satisfactory or
unsatisfactory response could both be a reason to end treatment),
clinical evaluation of symptom severity, and the patient's own
request. The first decision rule was to continue rTMS if a decrease of
at least 20% in BDI score was obtained after 10 sessions; the effect
was evaluated each subsequent fifth session. If no response
occurred by session 20e25, it was advised to abort treatment. If the
BDI indicated remission over the course of sessions, defined as a

 stable score �12 for 5 sessions, the patient was given the option to
end treatment, phase out sessions (gradually lowering the fre-
quency of sessions) or extend with maintenance sessions (one
session each 6e8 weeks). However, if the symptoms appeared to be
in remission but still showed a remarkable decrease, treatment was
continued until BDI scores were stabilizing.
Outcome measures
The Beck Depression Inventory, second edition, Dutch version
(BDI-II-NL) score was used as primary outcome measure. Response
to treatment was defined as �50% reduction in BDI score from
baseline to the last visit; remission as a BDI score �12 [35]. These
definitions were used at the last acute treatment visit to define
outcomes.
The Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS) [36] was used
as secondary outcome. The DASS is a self-report questionnaire and
consists of three scales: depression (DASS D), anxiety (DASS A), and
stress (DASS S). Each scale consists of 14 items with a 4-point
severity score, with a maximum total score of 42 on each scale.
The patient is asked to fill in the items based on experiences in the
previous week.
Both questionnaires were filled out at baseline, each fifth ses-
sion throughout treatment, at the last visit, and at 6-month follow-
up. For non-responders and drop-outs, the last available BDI score
was used as last visit measure (last observation carried forward).
For patients receiving maintenance sessions, the measure closest to
6 months after the last visit was used as follow-up score.
Analyses
Firstly, to evaluate treatment outcome of rTMS þ PT for the total
sample, paired t-tests were used to test changes in BDI and DASS
scores from baseline to last visit. Repeated-measures analysis of
variance (ANOVA) was used to assess BDI changes over the course
of treatment, using the scores of each fifth session. A separate
repeated-measures ANOVA was conducted for the group of patients
that completed follow-up.
Secondly, comparisons were made between responders and
non-responders. Differences in demographic and clinical baseline
variables were evaluated using independent samples t-tests for
continuous variables (age, baseline severity) and chi-square tests
for categorical variables (gender, rTMS protocol, suicide risk, MINI
diagnosis). Mixed design ANOVA with session (baseline/session 10/
last visit) and response (response/non-response) was performed to
evaluate differences in symptom severity over the course of treat-
ment. Similarly, a mixed ANOVA was conducted to compare rTMS
protocols (LF/HF) over the course of treatment (baseline/session 10/
last visit).
Lastly, clinical baseline variables and early treatment-emergent
changes were tested as predictors of treatment (non-)response.
Since previous reports suggest that age, age of onset and baseline
symptom severity may serve as clinically useful predictors [37e39],
these were selected as candidate variables. Negative predictive
values (NPVs) and positive predictive values (PPVs) were calculated
for each individual predictor, and if these did not meet a predefined
criterion of at least 0.8, combinations of various predictors were
used [39]. Variables meeting the criterion of 0.8 were included in a
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to determine sensi-
tivity and specificity. Youden's index [40] was used to identify
possible cut-off values.
Results
Demographic and clinical baseline variables
The total sample consisted of 196 patients, 98 female and 98
male, aged 18e78 (43.2 ± 12.9). Treatment resistance was not
systematically recorded, but post-hoc review of the files indicated
that >97% of the sample met the criteria of treatment-resistance,
defined
as
at
least
one
previous
antidepressant
treatment
without response. Clinical baseline and treatment variables are
specified in Table 1. Patients underwent on average 20.9 (SD ¼ 7.5)
sessions. Out of 196 patients starting treatment, 179 completed 10
sessions, 106 completed 20 sessions, 22 completed 30 sessions, 6
completed 40 sessions, and 3 continued until 50 or more sessions.
Total sample treatment outcome
Mean BDI scores were significantly reduced after rTMS þ PT
compared to baseline, t(194) ¼ 21.13, p < 0.001, d ¼ 1.54. Similarly,
significant reductions were observed at DASS D, t(168) ¼ 15.76,

DASS S, t(167) ¼ 13.51, p < 0.001, d ¼ 1.23. See Table 1 for mean
scores at baseline, the last visit, and the change in these scores. The
overall response was a 55.9% reduction in depression severity as
measured by BDI. The reduction in BDI over the course of treatment
was significant F(3.70, 385.01) ¼ 153.36, p < 0.001, h2 ¼ 0.60. Post-
hoc tests showed that BDI score decreased significantly each fifth
session over the course of treatment, except for the difference be-
tween session 10 and 15 (Fig. 2).
Response and remission
Treatment response was defined as �50% reduction in BDI score
from baseline to last visit. Based on this criterion, the sample
consisted of 130 responders and 66 non-responders. Thus, the
response rate was 66.3%. The remission rate was 56.0%, with 109
out of 196 patients achieving remission (BDI�12).
No differences between responders and non-responders existed
in age (t(194) ¼ 1.32, n.s.), gender (c2(1) ¼ 1.34, n.s.), diagnosis
(c2(7) ¼ 6.90, n.s.), suicide risk (c2(3) ¼ 4.59, n.s.), or rTMS protocol
(c2(2) ¼ 0.51, n.s.).
BDI at baseline was significantly higher in non-responders than
responders, t(194) ¼ 2.21, p < 0.05, d ¼ 0.3, and in non-remitters
than remitters, t(194) ¼ 5.87, p < 0.05, d ¼ 0.8. A mixed design
ANOVA (session � response) was used to test differences in BDI
over the course of treatment between responders and non-
responders. Measurements of three time points were used: base-
line, session 10, and the last visit, as these were available for most
patients (n ¼ 177; Table 2). A significant main effect over sessions
was observed, F(1.90, 336.45) ¼ 284.08, p < 0.001, h2 ¼ 0.62. Overall
BDI score was significantly different between responders and non-
responders as well, F(1, 177) ¼ 85.06, p < 0.001, h2 ¼ 0.33. Finally,
the interaction effect was significant, F(1.90, 336.45) ¼ 84.50,
p < 0.001, h2 ¼ 0.32 (Fig. 3). Repeated contrasts revealed a signifi-
cant interaction effect from baseline to session 10, F(1, 177) ¼ 34.50,
p < 0.001, h2 ¼ 0.16, as well as from session 10 to the last visit F(1,
177) ¼ 54.26, p < 0.001, h2 ¼ 0.24.
LF vs. HF rTMS protocol
A mixed design ANOVA (session � protocol) was used to test
changes in BDI over the course of treatment between patients
treated with the HF and LF protocol. Patients treated with both
protocols were excluded from this analysis, as this subgroup was
very small (n ¼ 7). Again, measurements of three time points were
used: baseline, session 10, and last visit (Table 2). A significant main
effect of session was observed, F(1.80, 306.44) ¼ 253.90, p < 0.001,
h2 ¼ 0.60. No differences in overall BDI score were found between
the HF and LF protocol groups, F(1, 170) ¼ 0.73, p ¼ 0.39. Finally, no
interaction effect was found, F(1.80, 306.44) ¼ 0.59, p ¼ 0.50 (Fig. 3).

 Maintenance and relapse
A total of 39 patients underwent maintenance sessions, with an
average of 4.9 sessions (Table 1). These maintenance sessions were
performed with a frequency of once every 6e8 weeks. Further-
more, 48 patients reported relapse and 42 of those came back for
rTMS treatment. In this group, relapse occurred on average at 10.23
months after the last visit. Patients who came back for rTMS
treatment after relapse underwent 7.12 additional sessions on
average.
Follow-up
Seventy-three patients completed BDI and DASS at 6-month
follow-up (Table 2). A repeated-measures ANOVA showed signifi-
cant differences from baseline to each fifth session until session 20,
last visit, and follow-up, F(2.90, 145.22) ¼ 69.65, p < 0.001,
h2 ¼ 0.58. Scores at follow-up were slightly higher than at the last
visit, but remained significantly lower than at baseline (Fig. 2).
In the follow-up group, 46 (63.0%) were responders. Out of 66
initial responders at end of treatment, 43 (65.2%) retained response
at follow-up. Thirty-nine (53.4%) patients were in remission at
follow-up; out of 60 remitters at end of treatment, 36 (60.0%) still
met remission criteria after 6 months.
No valid comparison of follow-up data could be made between
responders
and
non-responders,
since
only
7
of
the
non-
responders completed follow-up. When comparing patients who
received maintenance treatment to those who did not, there was a
significant difference between groups, F(1, 71) ¼ 8.22, p < 0.01,
h2 ¼ 0.10. No time � maintenance interaction was found, F(2.13,
151.29) ¼ 0.50, p ¼ 0.62. Patients who received maintenance ses-
sions had a higher score over sessions than those who did not
(Fig. 4), possibly indicating that those with higher severity
throughout treatment were more likely to receive maintenance
treatment.

 Response prediction
Clinical
baseline
variables
and
early
treatment-emergent
changes
were
tested
as
predictors
of
successful
treatment
response and remission. NPVs and PPVs were calculated for each
individual predictor based on discriminant analyses, and if these
did not meet the criterion of at least 0.8, combinations of clinical
baseline predictors with early treatment change were used.
No individual clinical baseline predictor reached a PPV or NPV of
0.8 (Supplement 1). Change in BDI from baseline to session 10
resulted in a satisfactory PPV, but not NPV for response. Combi-
nations of the clinical baseline variables with change in BDI early in
treatment did not result in satisfactory NPVs either. In other words,
change in symptom severity from baseline to session 10 can serve
as a useful treatment-emergent predictor of treatment response,
but none of the individual or combined clinical variables can pre-
dict non-response. For BDI percentage change at session 10, an ROC
curve was computed, which resulted in an area under the curve
(AUC) of 0.796 (Fig. 5). Thus, this model discriminated well be-
tween responders and non-responders; therefore, sensitivity and
specificity as well as Youden's index for possible cut-off points were
calculated (Supplement 2).
The cut-off value that discriminated best between responders
and non-responders was a reduction in BDI score of at least 40% at
session 10, with a sensitivity of 71.2% and a specificity of 75.0%,
J ¼ 0.462.
As for prediction of remission, none of the individual predictors
were clinically meaningful according to the predefined cut-off of
0.8 (Supplement 1). A satisfactory NPV was found for the combi-
nation of BDI change from baseline to session 10, baseline severity,
and age of onset. However, combining these variables in an ROC
curve (Fig. 5) resulted in an AUC of 0.670, indicating that the
discriminating value of this model remained poor.
Discussion
The aim of the present study was to evaluate the clinical
outcome of rTMS treatment combined with psychotherapy in a
large, representative population of MDD patients. Most impor-
tantly, the results demonstrate a remission rate of 56% compared to
earlier studies of rTMS monotherapy with remission rates up to 37%
[9,39]. In addition, a response rate of 66% was found, compared to
29e58% in monotherapy studies [9,38]. This outcome is promising,
since the high remission rate suggests an additional and clinically
meaningful effect of simultaneous rTMS and psychotherapy beyond
either treatment strategy alone. However, as valid comparisons
with previous studies are not possible due to differences in
outcome measures and procedure, future studies performing direct
comparisons of rTMS monotherapy and rTMS þ PT are strongly
warranted.
The question remains whether the combination of rTMS and
psychotherapy results in an enhanced effect through neuro-
plasticity as hypothesized, or whether it is merely a dose-response
relationship. The combination of two treatment strategies can be
interpreted as an increase in dose. In the current study, no standard
‘dosages’ in the form of total treatment duration or a standardized
number of sessions per week were applied, albeit in comparison to
the FDA approved rTMS protocol of 3000 pulses per session, the
TMS dose in this study was at a relatively low 1200e1500 pulses
per session. Future studies could incorporate and compare different
standardized operationalizations of dosage to rule out this expla-
nation for the relatively high response and remission rates.
Moreover, imaging studies could shed more light on the ques-
tion whether the enhanced effect is dependent on changes in brain
network connectivity through different pathways. Advances in
imaging technology allow for the simultaneous application of non-
invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) and fMRI or EEG [41,42,53]. These
methods could be used to provide insight into the effects that are
elicited by each treatment approach and their interaction, both at
the time of stimulation and over the course of treatment. Theo-
retically, effects of rTMS and PT may synergistically interact, but
also negatively interfere with each other [24]. This may be observed
on a functional level, where cognitive domains involved in PT may
be strengthened by rTMS: e.g. 1 Hz rTMS of the right DLPFC may
enhance episodic memories through reconsolidation in healthy
subjects [54]. Thus, by combining NIBS and PT, it may be possible to
dismantle cognitive components of PT in terms of their underlying
physiology.
Neuroimaging studies in depression, however, do not suggest
that fMRI connectivity networks and hubs where rTMS and CBT
(but also pharmacotherapy) show their modulatory action, do
simply overlap [52,55]. Innovative approaches are needed to
investigate in more detail differences and potential synergistic ef-
fects between rTMS plus PT vs. rTMS and PT monotherapy: e.g. 1)
EEG connectivity analyses applied to the specific DLPFC-sgACC
network implicated in MDD and treatment response (e.g. see
[51]: and [2]) more advanced data driven network connectivity
approaches to obtain biotypes of response to various rTMS ap-
proaches (e.g. see Ref. [52]).
Results at 6-month follow-up suggest a relatively stable effect
on the long term, with symptom severity slightly higher than at the
last visit, but significantly lower than at baseline. Moreover, 63% of
the follow-up sample still met response criteria and 53% met
remission criteria. Although this outcome might be biased since

 mainly responders were likely to return follow-up questionnaires,
it suggests that rTMS þ PT results in a sustainable reduction of
depressive symptoms. The results of the current study are com-
parable to an earlier report on long-term outcome of rTMS treat-
ment in a naturalistic setting, in which sustained response was
found in 56.8% of the patients and sustained remission in 50% [10];
in the current sample, these percentages were 65.2% and 60%,
respectively. Compared to long-term outcome in primary care, in
which 25% of patients typically achieve and maintain remission up
to 18 months after treatment [43], and to antidepressant medica-
tion with remission rates of 13e36.8% after one year [44], outcomes
of rTMS treatment at follow-up can be considered favorable. The
question whether the combination with psychotherapy has an
additional effect in the long term remains to be answered in future
studies using head-to-head comparison.
Within the follow-up sample, patients who received mainte-
nance sessions had significantly more severe depressive symptoms
throughout treatment than patients who did not. This is probably
the result of selection bias, where patients with more severe
symptoms and higher relapse risks are more frequently advised to
continue with maintenance sessions after treatment. The current
study cannot rule out the potential incremental value of mainte-
nance sessions because of the difference in symptom severity be-
tween those groups; an RCT would be necessary to draw solid
conclusions. Earlier reports do suggest that additional rTMS ses-
sions are associated with prolonged treatment effects [45]; there-
fore, future studies should use a systematic follow-up procedure
when evaluating maintenance sessions.
Prediction of treatment outcome based on clinical variables was
performed using NPVs and PPVs with a predefined criterion of 0.8.
None of the individual clinical baseline variables met this criterion,
underscoring the emerging idea that clinical factors alone are not
sufficient to predict treatment response [38], and that predictions
based on biological factors may be more informative and have
greater clinical utility [46,47]. Change in symptom severity early in
treatment could predict positive treatment response; moreover,
only the combination of baseline severity, age of onset, and change
in symptom severity after 10 sessions could predict non-remission.
This is also in line with previous studies showing that early
symptom change combined with clinical factors have a clinically
meaningful predictive value [39]. These results suggest that
response and remission cannot be predicted at baseline, but after
10 sessions of treatment, change in symptoms may be used as a
sufficiently strong predictor of response to make clinical decisions.
This is highly relevant in the application of rTMS, since it could be
used as to guide treatment decisions to continue or discontinue
rTMS treatment and hence help improve the cost-to-benefit ratio
for rTMS.
An example of how BDI change early in treatment may guide
treatment decisions is to use the percentage change to predict
positive response. In the current sample, a reduction of at least 40%
at session 10 discriminated best between responders and non-
responders. Therefore, patients who have achieved less than 40%
change at session 10 may be advised to proceed with add-on
strategies such as using bilateral rTMS (sequential HF and LF). The
efficacy of such strategies and decision rules should be evaluated in
future clinical studies.
An additional finding that may guide clinical decisions is that no
differences in clinical outcome were found between patients
treated with the HF and the LF protocol. This is an especially
important finding; as LF rTMS is better tolerated by patients and is
considered a safer protocol [48,49], the application of this protocol
in clinical practice may be preferable. Although reports on clinical
guidelines suggest that stronger evidence exists for the efficacy of
HF rTMS, this is mainly attributable to the smaller number of
placebo-controlled studies into LF rTMS [8] and recent adequately
powered RCTs demonstrate no substantial differences [50].
Limitations of the current study include some of the points
mentioned above, such as the lack of a direct comparison between
rTMS only, rTMS þ PT and psychotherapy only, and the lack of non-
responders participating in the follow-up sample. In addition, some
clinical factors that may affect treatment outcome were not sys-
tematically registered, such as level of treatment-resistance and
chronicity. Post-hoc review of patient files revealed that more than
97% of patients in our sample would have met eligibility criteria
similar to the FDA regulations for rTMS, meaning that they had
undergone at least one failed antidepressant treatment. In this
sense, our sample may be rather comparable to previous random-
ized controlled rTMS studies [2,3]. However, it is recommended for
future
studies
to
systematically
measure
clinical
variables,
including treatment resistance in order to also quantitatively
analyse the relationship between level of previous treatment
resistance and TMS treatment response. In addition, considering
that current findings were obtained in a naturalistic setting in
which external validity is high but internal validity and reliability
are limited, replication of our findings in randomized controlled
trials is mandatory.
In conclusion, the main additional effect of rTMS þ PT appears to
be a considerable remission rate at the end of treatment. These
effects were sustainable in most patients, and favorable compared
to long-term outcomes of other treatment approaches, especially
considering the high level of treatment resistance of this popula-
tion. Thus, the outcome of rTMS with simultaneous psychotherapy
can be considered clinically meaningful. Clear clinical guidelines
can be derived from these findings. Firstly, rTMS can be combined
with psychotherapy to achieve a higher likelihood of remission e
although future studies using a more standardized approach than
in the current naturalistic study are necessary to provide more
clarity on the role of clinical factors such as treatment resistance. In
addition, as HF and LF are equally effective, LF may be preferred as
patient tolerability and safety of this protocol is higher. Finally,
change in symptoms after session 10 may guide clinical decisions in
the continuation of treatment, with larger reductions predicting
positive response. Further investigation in RCTs performing direct
comparisons with either therapy alone, as well as studies into the
working mechanism and prediction of treatment response are
warranted to optimize its application.
