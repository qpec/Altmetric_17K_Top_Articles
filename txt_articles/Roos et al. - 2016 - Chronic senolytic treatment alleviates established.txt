Summary
While reports suggest a single dose of senolytics may improve
vasomotor function, the structural and functional impact of long-
term senolytic treatment is unknown. To determine whether
long-term senolytic treatment improves vasomotor function,
vascular stiffness, and intimal plaque size and composition in
aged or hypercholesterolemic mice with established disease.
Senolytic treatment (intermittent treatment with Dasatinib +
Quercetin via oral gavage) resulted in significant reductions in
senescent cell markers (TAF+ cells) in the medial layer of aorta
from aged and hypercholesterolemic mice, but not in intimal
atherosclerotic plaques. While senolytic treatment significantly
improved vasomotor function (isolated organ chamber baths) in
both groups of mice, this was due to increases in nitric oxide
bioavailability in aged mice and increases in sensitivity to NO
donors in hypercholesterolemic mice. Genetic clearance of senes-
cent cells in aged normocholesterolemic INK-ATTAC mice pheno-
copied changes elicited by D+Q. Senolytics tended to reduce
aortic calcification (alizarin red) and osteogenic signaling (qRT–
PCR, immunohistochemistry) in aged mice, but both were signif-
icantly reduced by senolytic treatment in hypercholesterolemic
mice. Intimal plaque fibrosis (picrosirius red) was not changed
appreciably by chronic senolytic treatment. This is the first study
to demonstrate that chronic clearance of senescent cells improves
established vascular phenotypes associated with aging and
chronic hypercholesterolemia, and may be a viable therapeutic
intervention to reduce morbidity and mortality from cardiovas-
cular diseases.

Introduction
Risk factors for ischemic heart disease include hypercholesterolemia,
arterial stiffness, chronic inflammation, hypertension, metabolic syn-
drome, and aging (Eckel et al., 2013). Importantly, these risk factors
contribute to impaired endothelial function (Feletou & Vanhoutte, 2006),
which can contribute to arterial remodeling and accelerate atheroscle-
rotic plaque formation and expansion (Landmesser et al., 2004).
Recent work suggests senescent cell burden can be dramatically
increased by chronological aging or in models of progeria (Lecka-Czernik
et al., 1997; Baker et al., 2004; Varela et al., 2005), high-fat feeding
(Shi et al., 2007), diabetes (Verzola et al., 2008), tobacco exposure
(Nyunoya et al., 2006), or atherosclerosis (Wang & Bennett, 2012), and
short-term treatment with ‘senolytic’ drugs in chronologically aged or
progeroid mice alleviates several aging-related phenotypes (Zhu et al.,
2015a,b). However, effects of long-term senescent cell clearance on
vascular reactivity and structure with aging or chronic hypercholes-
terolemia remain unknown.
Can chronic senolytic treatment improve
age-related vascular pathology?
To determine whether senolytic treatment with dasatinib and quercetin
(D+Q) reduces senescent cell burden and improves vascular function in
aged mice, we maintained C57BL/6J mice on standard chow for
24 months, and then initiated vehicle or D+Q once monthly for
3 months (i.e., oral gavage with a dasatinib (5 mg kg�1)/quercetin
(10 mg kg�1) cocktail once per month for months 24–27). TAF+
(telomere-associated foci) nuclei were used as a marker of senescent
cell burden (Hewitt et al., 2012). TAF+ nuclei were readily evident in
subpopulations of cells in aorta (and localized in both endothelial and
smooth muscle layers in the vessel wall) from vehicle-treated mice
(Fig. 1A–B and S1) and markedly reduced by D+Q (Fig. 1A–B and S1).
Reductions in TAF+ cells were also associated with reductions in DNA
damage (number of c-H2AX foci per cell) following D+Q (Fig. 1C).
In vehicle-treated mice, carotid arteries showed minimal relaxation to
acetylcholine assessed with an isolated organ chamber bath system
(Miller et al., 2010), which was significantly improved in mice receiving
intermittent D+Q for 3 months (Fig. 1D). In contrast to our previous
study using a single dose of D+Q in aged mice, vascular relaxation to
sodium nitroprusside was not changed by clearance of senescent cells in
aged mice (Fig. 1E), and peak contractile responses increased following
D+Q (Fig. S5, Supporting information). Similar senolytic efficacy and
phenotypic changes were observed following genetic clearance of
senescent cells in a subgroup of INK-ATTAC mice [which allow for
clearance of p16ink4a-positive senescent cells via a caspase-dependent

 mechanism (Baker et al., 2011)], thus confirming the effectiveness and
phenotypic consequences of senescent cell clearance (Figs S2–S4).
Collectively, these data suggest that acute senolytic treatment improves
vasomotor function by increasing VSMC sensitivity to NO, whereas
chronic, intermittent senolytic treatment improves vasomotor function
by increasing NO bioavailability.
To probe mechanisms underlying improvements in vasomotor func-
tion, we assayed endothelial nitric oxide synthase phosphorylation levels
(p-eNOSser1177, which are indicative of eNOS activation), but did not find
significant
differences
between
vehicle-
and
D+Q-treated
groups
Fig.
S6).
Despite
this
finding,
p-VASP239
(Fig. 1F),
a
target
of
NO-activated, cGMP-dependent kinases (Sporbert et al., 1999), was
significantly higher in D+Q-treated aged mice. Although previous reports
implicated reduced NOS cofactor production and increased Nox2-
derived free radicals in age-associated endothelial dysfunction (Turgeon
et al., 2012; Roos et al., 2013), we did not find significant changes in
mRNA levels of NOS-related or NADPH oxidase-related enzymes follow-
ing senolytic treatment (Figs S7–S9). Collectively, while our data suggest
that senolytic treatment improves NO signaling in aged mice, precise
molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon—including the
potential contributions of other endothelium-derived relaxing factors—
have yet to be elucidated.

 To determine whether senolytic treatment elicited structural changes
in conduit arteries, we evaluated pressure–diameter relationships from
carotid arteries in a pressurized organ chamber system (Matsumoto
et al., 2007). No changes in carotid artery cross-sectional compliance or
distensibility were observed following pharmacological senescent cell
clearance (Fig. S10). Medial vascular calcification in aorta, however,
tended to be reduced by pharmacological cell clearance (Fig. 1G) and
was paralleled by changes in protein levels of osterix (Fig. 1H). The
modest effects of senolytic treatment on structural aspects of large
arteries may be due to the period of time required to regress/reverse
age-related structural changes or the efficacy of senescent cell clearance
(e.g., higher and/or more frequent dosing with senolytic agents) required
to elicit regression of calcification or deleterious changes in vascular
compliance in conduit vessels.

intermittent senolytic treatment with Dasatinib + Quercetin did not alter lipid composition of plaques (H), senolytic treatment did significantly reduce vascular calcification (I),
which was associated with marked reductions in osterix immunofluorescence (J). In all panels, asterisk denotes p < 0.05.

 Can chronic senolytic treatment improve
hypercholesterolemia-induced vascular pathology?
To determine whether senolytic treatment with D+Q reduces senescent
cell burden and improves vascular function and structure in a model of
atherosclerosis, ApoE�/� mice were fed a Western diet (TD88137; Harlan
Teklad) for 4 months to allow development of established atheroscle-
rosis (Dansky et al., 1999). Vehicle or D+Q was then administered once
weekly (i.e., oral gavage with a dasatinib (5 mg kg�1)/quercetin
(10 mg kg�1) cocktail) for the next 2 months (i.e., months 4–6).
Similarly to aged mice, TAF-positive nuclei were abundant in the
media and in intimal plaques of aorta from vehicle-treated mice
(Fig. 2A–B). Interestingly, senolytic treatment reduced senescent cell
burden in medial segments of the vessel (Fig. 2A–B), but not in regions
with established intimal atherosclerotic plaques (Fig. 2A–B). Indices of
DNA damage paralleled reductions in senescent cell burden: reductions
in DNA damage were evident only in medial segments of atherosclerotic
vessels (Fig. 2C).
Unlike chronologically aged mice, D+Q did not improve responses to
acetylcholine in isolated carotid arterial rings in an organ chamber bath
system (Fig. 2D). We did, however, observe improved relaxation to
sodium nitroprusside (Fig. 2E). Peak tension elicited by the thromboxane
A2 agonist U46619 did not differ between treatment groups (Fig. S11).
Despite a lack of improvement in vasomotor responses to acetyl-
choline,
we
found
that
D+Q
significantly
increased
levels
of
p-eNOSser1177 (Fig. 2F). Similarly to aging mice, we observed increases
in p-VASP239 in aorta (Fig. 2G), suggesting that basal NO signaling was
improved in both medial and intimal regions of atherosclerotic vessels.
Although we observed relatively large increase in p-eNOSser1177 levels,
increases in p-VASP239 levels remained small (particularly when com-
pared to the relative reduction in p-VASP239 levels in the intimal plaque
region itself). When taken with the observation that senolytic treatment
increased NADPH oxidase-related protein in the intima (Figs S13–S14) in
the absence of changes in enzymes related to NOS cofactor generation
(Fig. S12), we conclude that changes in vasomotor function are likely the
result of a complex interplay between nitric oxide bioavailability
originating from the intima and oxidation state of sGC or downstream
signal transduction molecules within the media (Landmesser et al.,
2004; Feletou & Vanhoutte, 2006).
Regarding effects of senolytics on atherosclerotic plaque burden and
composition in aorta, we found intimal plaque size was not affected in
mice receiving D+Q for 2 months (Fig. S15), and analysis of Oil Red
O-stained sections suggested the overall lipid content of the plaque was
also unaffected by senolytic treatment (Fig. 2H). Furthermore, expres-
sion of F4/80 in atherosclerotic vessels did not change appreciably
(Fig. S16), suggesting negligible changes in overall macrophage burden.
Among other possibilities, this could be related to intimal plaque
penetrance by D+Q. Effects of newer senolytics, such as navitoclax (Zhu
et al., 2015a,b), remain to be determined. We did, however, find that
intimal plaque calcification was significantly reduced in D+Q- vs. vehicle-
treated mice (Fig. 2I). This was associated with reductions in protein
levels of osterix (Fig. 2J). Intimal plaque fibrosis was not appreciably
changed by senescent cell clearance (Fig. S17). This combination of
findings is remarkable given the observations that calcified lesions are
typically refractory to classic lipid-lowering interventions and occurred in
the absence of changes in plasma cholesterol levels (Fig. S18). These
changes in plaque morphology are consistent, however, with previous
reports demonstrating that senescent cells and cells overexpressing
genes associated with progeroid syndromes have greater propensity to
undergo osteogenic differentiation in vitro (Roos et al., 2013). Critically,
unlike previous studies leveraging chronic treatment with compounds
such as quercetin (e.g., administered in drinking water) (Hayek et al.,
1997; Shen et al., 2013), our study shows that weekly, intermittent
treatment is sufficient to elicit lasting molecular and functional conse-
quences in the vasculature of hypercholesterolemic mice. Altogether, we
believe these observations lay the groundwork for future studies aimed
at understanding effects of senolytics on plaque composition and
stability both in isolation and as a complementary therapy to lipid-
lowering strategies.
Conclusions
Collectively, this study shows that chronic pharmacological clearance of
senescent cells alleviates vasomotor dysfunction in naturally aging mice
and mice with established atherosclerosis. Furthermore, senescent cell
clearance reduces markers of osteogenesis in advanced intimal plaques,
ultimately reducing intimal plaque calcification. Based on these findings,
we conclude that senescent cell clearance may be an effective
complementary therapy to classical risk factor management to reduce
morbidity and mortality associated with age-related cardiovascular
diseases.
