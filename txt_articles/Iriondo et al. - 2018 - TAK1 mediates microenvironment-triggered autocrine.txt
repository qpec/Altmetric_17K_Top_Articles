Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly metastatic subtype of breast cancer that has
limited therapeutic options. Thus, developing novel treatments for metastatic TNBC is an
urgent need. Here, we show that nanoparticle-mediated delivery of transforming growth
factor-β1-activated kinase-1 (TAK1) inhibitor 5Z-7-Oxozeaenol can inhibit TNBC lung
metastasis in most animals tested. P38 is a central signal downstream of TAK1 in TNBC cells
in TAK1-mediated response to multiple cytokines. Following co-culturing with macrophages
or fibroblasts, TNBC cells express interleukin-1 (IL1) or tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα),
respectively. Compared to TAK1 inhibition, suppressing IL1 signaling with recombinant IL1
receptor antagonist (IL1RA) is less efficient in reducing lung metastasis, possibly due to the
additional TAK1 signals coming from distinct stromal cells. Together, these observations
suggest that TAK1 may play a central role in promoting TNBC cell adaptation to the lung
microenvironment by facilitating positive feedback signaling mediated by P38. Approaches
targeting the key TAK1-P38 signal could offer a novel means for suppressing TNBC lung
metastasis.

reast cancer is the most common cancer in women
worldwide1. It is a heterogeneous disease with several
subtypes corresponding to different treatment options and
prognoses2, 3. Clinically, based on the status of estrogen receptor
(ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth
factor receptor 2 (ERBB2/HER2)—patients are categorized into
ER/PR+, HER2+, or triple-negative subtypes. Hormonal thera-
pies
and
HER2
targeted
therapies
have
led
to
dramatic
improvement in the overall prognosis of ER/PR+ and Her2+
subtypes, respectively. However, the overall survival status of
triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) remains the worst among
breast cancers and has remained stagnant over the past 20 years
because of TNBC’s aggressive nature and the lack of targeted
therapies4. TNBC constitutes approximately 20% of breast cancer
cases and has high rate of metastasis, particularly to the visceral
organs, such as the lung, liver, and brain. Chemotherapy is still
the standard treatment for both early and metastatic TNBC
patients4. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop new ther-
apeutic interventions for preventing and treating metastasis for
the management of TNBC patients.
Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1)-activated kinase-1
(TAK1) is a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase
(MAP3K7) that was discovered for its role in mediating TGFβ and
bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling5. Since then, it has
been shown that TAK1 can be activated by a variety of cytokines
and signals besides TGFβ, including interleukin-1 (IL1)6, tumor
necrosis factor-α (TNFα)7, tumor necrosis factor apoptosis-
inducing ligand8, BMP9, Wnt10, 11, and lipopolysaccharide12–14.
In response to these stimuli, TAK1 is involved in the inflamma-
tory, innate immune response, and non-canonical Wnt pathway
by activating a list of downstream signals, including P387, 13, 14,
ERK15, JNK7, 13, 14, and NFκB7, 12, 13.
Recently, TAK1 has been shown to play a role in tumorigen-
esis. We have previously demonstrated that targeting TAK1 can
inhibit distant metastasis in a pancreatic cancer mouse model16
and induce KRAS-dependent apoptosis in colorectal cancer17.
Melisi et al.18 have reported that inhibiting TAK1 can sensitize
pancreatic cancer cells to the chemotherapeutic drug gemcitabine.
In breast cancer, recent studies have shown that TAK1 plays
important roles in mediating the effects of CCN619, TRAF420,
UBC1321, and mir-892b22 on tumor progression and metastasis,
and that targeting TAK1 enhances doxorubicin (DOXO)-medi-
ated apoptosis and reduces invasive behavior23, 24. Analysis of
TAK1 expression levels in breast tumors from the TCGA dataset
using Oncomine showed a higher expression of TAK1 in TNBC
compared to other subtypes (Supplementary Fig. 1a). This indi-
cates that TAK1 is a potential candidate target for developing
TNBC targeted therapy.
The tumor microenvironment plays a crucial role in cancer
progression, with different signals from the microenvironment
having tumor-promoting and tumor-suppressing effects25. Dur-
ing metastatic spread, tumor cells adapt to the microenvironment
in the secondary organ and are likely to use local signals to
activate specific pathways to promote tumor growth. Many of the
TAK1-activating inflammatory cytokines are also present in the
tumor microenvironment and involved in breast cancer pro-
gression26. For example, a higher level of IL1 has been correlated
with more aggressive and high-grade breast cancers, and an ele-
vated level of IL1’s natural antagonist—recombinant IL1 receptor
antagonist (IL1RA)—and a lower level of IL1 is a good prognostic
indicator for breast cancer patients27–31. Interestingly, IL1α, IL1β,
and IL1RA are expressed at a much higher level in TNBC cell
lines compared to luminal cells32, suggesting that the IL1 pathway
could have an even more critical role in this subset of breast
tumors. In other cancers—such as melanoma, lung, and colon
carcinoma—IL1 has been shown to promote proliferation, inhibit
apoptosis, and induce angiogenesis28, 29. TGFβ and TNFα, which
can also lead to TAK1 activation, are well recognized for their
roles in tumorigenesis26. Thus, TAK1 may play a crucial role in
mediating
tumor
cell
interaction
with
the
local
microenvironment.
In previous studies, we demonstrated that 5Z-7-Oxozeaenol
(OXO)33, a potent ATP-competitive irreversible inhibitor for
TAK1, had strong inhibitory effect against TAK1-mediated
phenotypes in pancreatic cancer16 and colorectal cancer17.
However, the poor solubility of OXO limits its in vivo bioavail-
ability and clinical utility in cancer therapy. Nanoparticle-
mediated delivery of OXO could potentially solve this problem
by prolonging its circulation half-life and improving its phar-
macokinetics, thus resulting in enhanced therapeutic efficacy
while reducing unwanted side effects.
Our previous application of cross-linked multilamellar lipo-
somal vesicles (cMLVs) in a mouse melanoma model has
demonstrated that these nanoparticles can achieve controlled
delivery of cancer therapeutics with improved drug release
kinetics and enhanced particle stability34. cMLVs exhibit an
enhanced ability to accumulate in tumors, with fewer particles in
the blood, heart, and spleen. In addition, cMLVs loaded with the
anticancer drug DOXO have significantly improved therapeutic
activity in inhibiting tumor growth35. Furthermore, cMLVs can
encapsulate both hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs36. Indeed,
we have shown that nanoparticles loaded with DOXO (hydro-
philic) and paclitaxel (hydrophobic) are highly efficient in indu-
cing apoptosis in tumors and overcoming multidrug resistance36.
In this study, we aimed to use cMLV nanoparticles to deliver
the TAK1 inhibitor OXO and evaluate the role of TAK1 in TNBC
lung metastasis, as well as decipher the upstream and down-
stream signaling that is crucial for TAK1-mediated lung metas-
tasis in TNBC. We found that inhibition of TAK1 by different
methods can reduce lung metastasis. Interactions with different
components of the tumor microenvironment induce expression
of distinct TAK1-activating cytokines in TNBC cells, which can
lead to a positive feedback loop that amplifies TAK1 signaling,
promoting metastatic growth.
Results
OXO nanoparticles can suppress lung metastasis. To study the
effect of TAK1 inhibition on established primary tumors and
metastatic growth, we used cMLVs loaded with the TAK1 inhi-
bitor OXO. We also used nanoparticles loaded with DOXO, a
chemotherapy drug widely used in breast cancer treatment, as a
control for drug efficiency. Both OXO and DOXO could effi-
ciently be released from cMLVs in vitro (Supplementary Fig. 1b
and Fig. 1a), leading to dose-dependent decreases in the viability
of MDA-MB-231 cells—comparable to those achieved when cells
were treated with free OXO or DOXO (Supplementary Fig. 1c, d).
To study the effect of TAK1 inhibition on established primary
breast tumors, MDA-MB-231 cells tagged with green fluorescent
protein (GFP) and luciferase (MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc) were
injected into the mammary fat pads of NSG (NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid
Il2rgtm1Wj1/SzJ) mice. Fourteen days later, mice were randomly
assigned to four groups, each of which received cMLVs contain-
ing empty vehicle (EV), OXO, DOXO, or the combination of
both drugs (OXO + DOXO). After 30 days of treatment, as
expected, mice treated with DOXO had smaller tumors compared
to the control mice. In contrast, tumors from OXO-treated mice
were similar to those found in control mice (Fig. 1b, c), showing
that TAK1 inhibition does not impair the growth of established
primary tumors.
We next evaluated whether cMLV-encapsulated OXO has any
effect on lung metastatic lesions. MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells

for 2 weeks, after which primary tumors were resected. Starting
1 day after primary tumor removal, mice were treated with EV,
OXO, DOXO, or OXO and DOXO containing cMLVs for
30 days. To eliminate the influence of residual primary tumors,
the effect on lung metastasis was evaluated in mice with clean
primary tumor removal (see Methods). The metastatic signal in
the mouse lungs was drastically reduced in most of the mice
treated with OXO (Fig. 2a). Mice treated with DOXO also showed
reduced bioluminescence signals in the lungs; however, unlike
OXO, treatment with DOXO showed significant toxicity for the
mice, demonstrated by decreased body weight and impaired
kidney and liver functions, while mice treated with OXO showed
little to no sign of toxicity (Fig. 2a, b and Supplementary Fig. 2a).

 In order to confirm that the decrease in lung metastasis
observed in mice treated with OXO was due to its ability to
inhibit TAK1, we used MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells overexpres-
sing wild-type TAK1 (TAK1-wt) or a dominant-negative form of
TAK1 (TAK1-dn) in a doxycycline-inducible manner (Fig. 2c).
TAK1-dn has a point mutation (K63W) in the ATP-binding
domain that abrogates its kinase activity. Mutant TAK1 can still
bind to TAB1 and TAB2/3, competing with endogenous TAK1
and thus acting as a dominant-negative form7. TAK1-wt and
TAK1-dn MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells were cultured in the
presence or absence of doxycycline for 2 days to induce the
overexpression of either form of TAK1. Cells were then injected
into the tail veins of NSG mice. Mice injected with the
doxycycline-treated cells received doxycycline in their drinking
water, and the bioluminescent signal was measured every 2 weeks.
As shown in Fig. 2d, overexpression of wild-type TAK1 increased
lung metastasis, while overexpression of dominant-negative
TAK1 reduced it (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Fig. 2b).
TAK1/P38 mediate responses to cytokines. Depending on the
cellular and microenvironmental context, TAK1 can lead to the
activation of several pathways, including P38 MAPK, ERK1/2
MAPK, and NFκB37. To test which signaling pathways are
influenced by TAK1 in TNBC cells, we treated MDA-MB-231
cells overexpressing inducible wild-type or dominant-negative
TAK1 with several cytokines known to activate TAK15–7 that
could have relevant roles in lung metastasis26. In order to avoid
possible interference by cytokines present in the fetal bovine
serum (FBS) of our regular culture media, the experiment was
first performed in cells cultured in suspension conditions in FBS-
free media. Cells cultured in the presence or absence of doxycy-
cline for 2 days were treated with IL1α (Fig. 3a), IL1β (Fig. 3b),
TGFβ (Fig. 3c), or TNFα (Fig. 3d). In all four cases, the increase
in P38 phosphorylation in response to the cytokines was abro-
gated by the overexpression of the dominant-negative TAK1. In
addition, overexpression of wild-type TAK1 increased P38
phosphorylation levels, both in the presence and absence of
cytokine stimulation (Fig. 3a-d ). In contrast, ERK1/2 and P65
phosphorylation did not change significantly after inhibiting
TAK1 activity by the overexpression of TAK1-dn (Supplementary
Fig. 3a). Blocking TAK1 activity also prevented cytokine-induced
P38 phosphorylation in 4T1 and HS578T cells (Fig. 3e and
Supplementary Fig. 3b), showing that TAK1 activity is required
for P38 phosphorylation in several TNBC cell lines. Similar effects
in P38 phosphorylation were found when the experiment was
performed in regular cell culture conditions. However, in this
case, P65 phosphorylation in response to cytokines was partially
prevented
by
overexpression
of
dominant-negative
TAK1,
although the effect was not as pronounced as for P38 phos-
phorylation (Supplementary Fig. 3c, d).
Macrophages induce IL1 expression in tumor cells. We ana-
lyzed the cytokine sources in the normal NSG mouse lung and
found that they were more prominently expressed by stromal

 cells (Supplementary Fig. 4a). Given the known role of macro-
phages in tumor tissues25, we hypothesized that macrophages
recruited to lung metastatic lesions could express TAK1-
activating cytokines upon interacting with cancer cells. To test
this in vitro, GFP-tagged MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured with
RAW264.7 murine macrophages for 5 days, after which cancer
cells and macrophages were separated by fluorescence-activated
cell sorting (FACS) based on GFP expression. Quantitative real-
time PCR (qPCR) analysis showed that mRNA expression levels
of Il1α, Il1β, Tgfβ, and Tnfα in macrophages did not significantly
change when these cells were co-cultured with MDA-MB-231
cells (Fig. 4a). In contrast, MDA-MB-231 cells cultured with
macrophages upregulated the expression of IL1α and IL1β at the
mRNA
level,
whereas
TGFβ
and
TNFα
expression
levels
remained unchanged (Fig. 4b). Intracellular flow cytometry
showed that, on average, 1.86% and 0.44% of MDA-MB-231 cells
co-cultured with macrophages expressed IL1α and IL1β at the
protein level, respectively (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. 4b),
suggesting that only a small subset of MDA-MB-231 cells
respond to signals from macrophages by increasing the expres-
sion of these cytokines. Immunofluorescence analysis of lungs of
NSG mice injected with MDA-MB-231 cells showed that cancer
cells surrounded by macrophages express IL1α and IL1β as early
as 5 days post injection (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig. 4c). The
increase in IL1α and IL1β in response to the co-culture with
macrophages depends on TAK1 and P38 activity, since it is
prevented when TAK1 activity is blocked by overexpressing
dominant-negative TAK1 (Fig. 4e) or by treating cells with the
P38 inhibitor SB203580 (Fig. 4f and Supplementary Fig. 4d). In
contrast, despite the fact that macrophages used for the co-culture
experiment secrete high levels of TNFα (Supplementary Fig. 4e),
blocking the NFκB pathway using PS1145 does not influence the

 upregulation of IL1α and IL1β by the co-culture condition
(Supplementary Fig. 4f, g). Cancer cells treated with recombinant
IL1α or IL1β upregulate the expression of those same cytokines
(Supplementary Fig. 4h), suggesting that secretion of IL1α or IL1β
in a few cancer cells could lead to the upregulation of both
cytokines in neighboring cancer cells. These experiments suggest
that TAK1-P38-mediated upregulation of IL1α and IL1β as a
consequence of interactions with macrophages establishes a
positive feedback loop involving TAK1 and P38 that would lead
to enhanced activity of the pathway, favoring metastatic growth.
Corroborating our results, P38 has been shown to be critical for
TNBC lung metastasis19, 21.
Targeting IL1 is less sufficient in suppressing metastasis. Sev-
eral types of solid tumors—including breast, colon, lung, head,
and neck cancers and melanoma—overexpress IL1β29. In breast
cancer, IL1α and IL1β expression has been correlated with the

differentiation27, 30, 31. Based on these findings and our results
showing that tumor cells upregulate IL1α and IL1β when in
contact with macrophages, we hypothesized that increased IL1
expression could promote lung metastasis by activating the
TAK1-P38 pathway. To test this, we used the interleukin 1
receptor antagonist (IL1RA) anakinra, which is Food and
Drug Administration-approved for the treatment of rheumatoid
arthritis,
and
shows
no
toxicity
in
mice
(Supplementary
Fig. 5a, b). We first confirmed the effect of IL1RA by western blot,
showing that MDA-MB-231 cells treated with IL1RA are unable
to increase P38 phosphorylation in response to treatment with
IL1α (Fig. 5a). Next, MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells overexpressing
TAK1-dn were injected into the tail veins of NSG mice after being
cultured with or without doxycycline for 2 days, and the effect of
IL1 receptor inhibition on cancer metastasis was evaluated.
Control mice and mice receiving doxycycline in drinking water
were intraperitoneally injected with phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) or 1.5 mg/kg anakinra daily, starting 2 days before the
injection of cancer cells, and lung metastatic burden was eval-
uated 4 weeks later by bioluminescence imaging. Consistent with
the previous results shown in Fig. 2d, inactivation of TAK1
activity by overexpressing dominant-negative TAK1 significantly
reduced metastasis formation (Fig. 5b). However, although mice
treated with anakinra showed a tendency towards decreased
metastatic burden, the difference did not reach statistical sig-
nificance (p = 0.08) (Fig. 5b). We next sought to determine if
blocking TAK1 and/or IL1 pathways could influence metastatic
growth in immune competent mice, using the murine breast
cancer cell line 4T1 in syngeneic BALB/c mice. 4T1 cells treated
with IL1RA also failed to induce P38 phosphorylation in response
to IL1α treatment (Fig. 5c). Upon injection of luciferase-tagged
4T1-TAK1-dn cells, mice that received doxycycline treatment
developed significantly fewer metastases than control mice.
Anakinra treatment also decreased lung metastatic signals with a
difference approaching statistical significance (p = 0.06). Mice in
which both TAK1 and IL1 signaling were blocked by the
administration of both doxycycline and anakinra showed sig-
nificantly lower metastatic burden than mice that received a
single treatment (Fig. 5d). The fact that TAK1 inhibition sig-
nificantly reduced metastatic growth in both mouse models, while
IL1 inhibition had a smaller effect could mean that cancer cells in
the lung microenvironment are provided with other signals that
can activate the TAK1-P38 pathway. Indeed, we found that
MDA-MB-231 cells cultured in the presence of NIH/3T3 fibro-
blasts upregulate mRNA expression levels of TNFα (Fig. 5e),
which can increase P38 phosphorylation in a TAK1-dependent
manner (Fig. 3d). In addition, TNFα was detected in lung
micrometastasis of mice injected with MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc
cells (Fig. 5f and Supplementary Fig. 5c).
Discussion
In this study, we have shown that cMLV nanoparticle-mediated
delivery of the TAK1 inhibitor OXO could potentially suppress
the development of lung metastasis formed by TNBC cells
without detectable toxicity. P38 is the predominant signaling
induced by TAK1 in response to a list of cytokines. TAK1-P38
signaling enables an autocrine positive feedback loop to induce
TAK1-activating cytokine expression in tumor cells. The specific
cytokines induced in the tumor cells depend upon the stromal
cells with which tumor cells interact. These data suggest that
TAK1-P38 is a central signaling pathway facilitating TNBC cell
adaptation in the lung, providing a plausible rationale for
developing therapeutic interventions involving this pathway for
managing TNBC lung metastasis.
The cMLVs loaded with OXO showed an inhibitory effect on
lung metastasis development in mouse models in which primary
tumors had been cleanly removed. With the exception of one
mouse which showed high metastatic signal, all other animals
treated with the TAK1 inhibitor had decreased metastatic signals
that were similar to those in mice treated with DOXO. The effect
of OXO is validated by overexpression of wild-type or dominant-
negative TAK1. However, the dramatic difference is the lack of
toxicity to the animals treated by OXO in contrast to DOXO. For
patients with TNBC, treatment options remain limited to sys-
temic chemotherapies, and there are few novel targeted therapies
currently in clinical trials in TNBC, despite a compelling need for
new agents. In addition, patients suffer from toxicity associated
with systemic chemotherapies. Considering the toxicity of che-
motherapy in patients and the efficiency of cMLV-mediated
delivery of OXO in reducing lung metastasis in mice, we believe
that nanoparticle-mediated delivery of the TAK1 inhibitor is an
approach that could potentially improve treatment of TNBC lung
metastasis.
P38 is central to TAK1 function in TNBC cells in response to
various cytokines. This is different from the findings in immune
cells during the inflammatory response, where, in response to
different inflammatory cytokines, TAK1 activates an array of
downstream pathways, including NFκB, P38, ERK, JNK, etc7. In
TNBC cells, we found that P38 is the predominant signal
downstream of TAK1 and is critical for autocrine IL1 expression.
Importantly, others have shown that the inhibitor against P38,
SB203580, suppressed TNBC lung metastasis in a mouse model21.
We did not see an inhibitory effect on established primary
tumors, suggesting that TAK1 signaling is not essential for
maintaining tumor growth once primary tumors have been
established. This finding is similar to several previous reports
showing no effect on primary tumor growth by targeting
upstream or downstream TAK1 pathways21, 24. This could be due
to the distinct microenvironments of the primary tumor and the
lung, resulting in different dependence on TAK1 function.
Interestingly, a study has shown that depleting macrophages
using CSF-1R inhibitors in primary breast tumors has no effect
on primary tumor growth, unless used in combination with
another treatment38. In contrast, the same approach showed a
robust suppression of glioma39. These different responses in
breast and brain cancers suggest the possible divergent influences
of these cells in distinct organs.
Our most intriguing finding is that when TNBC cells are in
contact
with
macrophages
or
fibroblasts,
there
is
microenvironment-triggered increase in IL1 or TNFα levels,
respectively, which can lead to autocrine positive feedback loops
in the cancer cells. TAK1-P38 signaling is crucial for IL1

 autocrine signaling. Once IL1 pathway is activated in some cells,
the signal can be amplified and spread to neighboring cells. To
our knowledge, this is the first report showing a TAK1-P38-
mediated positive feedback loop in TNBC cells. This finding
underscores the complex interactions between tumor cells and
stromal cells in the tumor microenvironment, revealing multiple
means to active the TAK1 signal. Thus, suppressing either one of
the upstream cytokines is not sufficient to completely block
TAK1-mediated downstream signaling and metastatic growth.
The results of the experiments we performed using the IL1
receptor inhibitor anakinra also point in this direction. In both
mouse models tested, the group of mice treated with anakinra
showed a tendency towards decreased metastatic burden, but the
effect was not as pronounced as when TAK1 was inhibited, either
with nanoparticle-encapsulated OXO (if we exclude the outlier
sample) or by overexpressing the dominant-negative TAK1. We
do not know which molecule in stromal cells triggers the positive
feedback loop in tumor cells. Even though there is a clear
expression of TNFα by macrophages, NFκB inhibitors did not
have any effect in blocking the positive feedback loop of IL1.
A growing body of data has demonstrated the contribution of
the tumor microenvironment to tumor growth and progression25.
It is a general consensus that metastasis formation is regulated to

microenvironment25, 40. Tumor cells deposited in a new organ,
such as lung, must be able to adapt to the new environment and
overcome the suppressive signals to support their growth. In this
complex network, TAK1 seems to play a crucial role. TAK1 is a

 well-known factor that plays a central role in immune cells during
inflammation. It is a key kinase linking cellular responses to
exogenous stimuli. Thus, it is not surprising to see that tumor
cells also utilize TAK1 in adapting to their new microenviron-
ments. In human patients, it is likely that the microenvironment
is even more complex than immunodeficient xenograft mouse
models and includes additional immune cells that reside or are
recruited to lung metastatic sites. These immune cells could
augment the crucial role of TAK1 in mediating this metastatic
adaptation. It is tempting to speculate that TAK1 is an essential
cell adaptation kinase, responding to local cytokines and forming
positive feedback loops to support its signaling, at least in TNBC
metastasizing to the lung. Thus, targeting TAK1 or downstream
P38 could be effective in inhibiting lung metastasis. Whether
TAK1 plays a similar role in metastases to other organs needs
further investigation. Of note, a study showed that TAK1 pro-
vided a suppressive signal for breast cancer to bone metastasis
downstream of HGFK141, contrary to most reports in lung
metastasis, suggesting that the role of TAK1 could be particularly
important in lung metastases. In addition, another unanswered
question is whether the role of TAK1 in TNBC is heterogeneous
among different molecular subclasses of TNBC, due to their
distinct molecular properties42.
Methods
Cell culture and reagents. MDA-MB-231, 4T1, HS578T, HEK293T, RAW264.7,
and NIH/3T3 cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection.
MDA-MB-231, HS578T, HEK293T, RAW264.7, and NIH/3T3 cells were grown in
Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media supplemented with 10% FBS, while 4T1 cells
were grown in RPMI media containing 10% FBS. None of the cell lines is listed as
commonly misidentified cell lines by ICLAC. All cell lines were routinely tested for
mycoplasma contamination.
To study the involvement of TAK1 in activating different signaling pathways,
cells cultured in the presence or absence of 1 μg/ml doxycycline (Clontech) for 48 h
were treated with recombinant IL1α (10 ng/ml, 10 min), IL1β (10 ng/ml, 10 min),
TGFβ (2 ng/ml, 5 min), or TNFα (20 ng/ml, 10 min). All cytokines were purchased
from R&D Systems. For in vitro experiments using recombinant human IL1RA
(Peprotech), cells were treated with 100 ng/ml IL1RA for 30 min, followed by
treatment with IL1α (10 ng/ml) for an additional 10 min. For experiments done in
suspension conditions, cells were plated in poly-hema-coated dishes in RPMI
media supplemented with B27 (Invitrogen), 20 ng/ml epidermal growth factor
(Peprotech), and 20 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor (Peprotech).
Co-culture experiments were performed by plating MDA-MB-231 cells stably
expressing GFP and luciferase and RAW264.7 macrophages or non-tagged MDA-
MB-231 cells and GFP-expressing 3T3 fibroblasts by themselves or in combination.
After 3 or 5 days (see figure legends), cells were trypsinized and separated based on
GFP expression by FACS, and RNA was extracted from the sorted cells. In some
cases, cells were treated with 1 μg/ml doxycycline, 2 μM PS1145 (R&D System,
975108), or 1 μM SB203580 (Abcam, ab146589) from the beginning of the
experiment.
Generation of stable cell lines. The doxycycline-inducible expression constructs
containing wild-type or K63W mutant TAK1 were generated by subcloning each
open reading frame into the pInducer 20 lentiviral vector43 using the Gateway
cloning system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For virus packaging, HEK293T cells
were co-transfected with the lentiviral expression plasmid, the packaging construct
pCMVdeltaR8.91, and the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein G (VSV-G)
envelope construct using TransIT-LT1 (Mirus). Viral supernatants collected 48 and
72 h post transfection were combined, filtered through 0.45 μM polyethersulfone
filters, and stored in aliquots at −80 °C. The lentiviral plasmid expressing GFP-
luciferase (GFP-luc) was obtained from C. Ponzetto (University of Torino, Italy)
and co-transfected with third-generation lentivirus packaging plasmids (PMDL,
REV, and VSV-G) using Lipofectamine 2000. Viral supernatants collected 48 h
after transfection were filtered, concentrated using Lenti-X-concentrator (Takara),
and stored at −80 °C. Transductions were carried out in the presence of 8 μg/ml
polybrene (Sigma). Cells infected with pInducer 20 viruses were selected with 1 mg/
ml geneticin (Invitrogen), while cells expressing the GFP-luc construct were
selected by FACS.
Preparation of cMLVs. All lipids were obtained from NOF Corporation (Japan):
1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC), 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-
phospho-(10-rac-glycerol) (DOPG), and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoetha-
nolamine-N-[4-(p-maleimidophenyl) butyramide (maleimide-headgroup lipid,
MPB-PE). DOXO and OXO were purchased from Tocris Bioscience.
Liposomes were prepared based on the conventional dehydration–rehydration
method. All lipids were combined in chloroform at a molar lipid ratio of DOPC
−DOPG−MPB = 4:1:5, and the chloroform in the lipid mixture was evaporated
under argon gas. The lipid mixture was further dried under a vacuum overnight to
form dried thin lipid films. In order to prepare cMLVs (DOXO + OXO), OXO was
mixed with the lipid mixture in organic solvent before the formation of the dried
thin lipid films. The resultant dried film was hydrated in 10 mM Bis-Tris propane
at pH 7.0 with DOXO by vigorous vortexing every 10 min for 1 h. Four cycles of 15
s sonication were then applied (Misonix Microson XL2000, Farmingdale, NY,
USA) on ice at 1 min intervals for each cycle. To induce divalent-triggered vesicle
fusion, MgCl2 was added at a final concentration of 10 mM. The resulting
multilamellar vesicles were further cross-linked by the addition of dithiothreitol
(Sigma-Aldrich), at a final concentration of 1.5 mM for 1 h at 37 °C. The resulting
vesicles were collected by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 4 min and then washed
twice with PBS. For pegylation of cMLVs, the particles were incubated with 1 μmol
of 2 kDa PEG-SH (Laysan Bio Inc. Arab, AL, USA) for 1 h at 37 °C. The particles
were then centrifuged and washed twice with PBS. The final products were stored
in PBS at 4 °C.
In vitro drug encapsulation and release. To obtain the release behavior of DOXO
and OXO from cMLVs, the releasing media was removed from cMLVs incubated
in 10% FBS-containing media at 37 °C and replaced with fresh media every other
day. The removed media were quantified for DOXO fluorescence (by spectro-
fluorometer) and OXO fluoresence (by high-performance liquid chromatography)
after different retention times (flow rate 1 ml/min).
In vitro cytotoxicity assay. MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a
concentration of 5 × 103 cells per well and incubated at 37 °C for 6 h. Cells were
then exposed to a series of concentrations of single drug-loaded cMLVs for 48 h.
Fifty microliters of XTT labeling mixture (Roche Applied Science) was then added.
After incubation at 37 °C for 4 h, the absorbance of the solution was measured at
570 nm using a microplate reader (Molecular Devices) to determine the optical
density value. Cell viability was calculated by subtracting absorbance values
obtained from media-only wells from drug-treated wells and then normalizing to
the control cells without drugs. Data are given as mean ± SD of three independent
measurements.
Assessment of in vivo toxicity. Mouse blood was collected through cardiac
puncture and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 3 min. Serum was transferred to new
tubes and immediately frozen. Blood urea nitrogen, alanine aminotransferase, and
aspartate aminotransferase were measured using colorimetric kits according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
Mouse xenograft tumor assays. The animal protocol was approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Southern
California. For mouse experiments using nanoparticles, 6-week old female NSG
mice (Jackson Laboratory) were anesthetized with isofluorane and two million
MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells in 100 μl of 1:1 PBS and Matrigel (BD) were injected
into the fourth mammary fat pad. To evaluate the effect of OXO and DOXO on the
growth of established primary tumors, mice were separated into four groups
2 weeks after tumor cell injection, and each group was treated with empty vesicles
or nanoparticles containing OXO (2 mg/kg), DOXO (2 mg/kg), or the combination
of both drugs by tail vein injection every 3 days for 4 weeks, after which tumor
weight was measured. To evaluate the effect of the drugs upon metastasis forma-
tion, primary tumors were resected 2 weeks after orthotopic injection of MDA-
MB-231-GFP/luc cells. Mice were randomized according to residual primary tumor
signal and mouse weight, assigned to one of four groups, and treated with empty
vesicles or nanoparticles containing OXO, DOXO, or the combination of both
every 3 days, starting the day after tumor resection. Metastatic load was evaluated
by ex vivo imaging of lungs. Mice were intraperitoneally injected with 150 μl of D-
Luciferin substrate at 30 mg/ml (Sid Labs), and sacrificed after 5 min, and their
lungs were dissected and imaged using IVIS Lumina II (Perkin Elmer). Only mice
for which complete tumor resection was achieved were considered for the analysis.
This was evaluated by looking at images taken shortly after primary tumor
removal.
For tail vein injection, 200,000 MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc or 100,000 4T1-luc cells
overexpressing doxycycline-inducible wild-type or mutant forms of TAK1 were
injected into the lateral tail vein of 7-week-old or 8-week- old female NSG or
BALB/c mice, respectively. Signals from luciferase-tagged cells were monitored
weekly by in vivo imaging. Doxycycline was supplied in drinking water (with 1%
sucrose). The IL1RA anakinra (Kineret, Sobi) was injected intraperitoneally on a
daily basis at 1.5 mg/kg, starting 2 days before tumor cell injection. For experiments
with doxycycline and anakinra treatments, mice were randomized according to
their weight.
Investigators were not blinded to group allocation during the experiment and
when assessing the outcome of the experiment. No statistics were applied to
determine sample size.

 Western blotting. For western blot analysis, cells were lysed in Laemmli buffer
(50 mM Tris, pH 6.8, 1.25% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 15% glycerol). Cell extracts
were heated at 95 °C for 15 min for a complete lysis and denaturalization. After
protein quantification with Lowry protein assay (Bio-Rad), 5% (v/v) β-
mercaptoethanol (Sigma), and bromophenol-blue (Sigma) were added to each
lysate. Proteins were separated on 4–15% polyacrylamide gradient gels (Bio-Rad)
and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Millipore). Pri-
mary and secondary antibodies used are listed in Supplementary Table 1 and
Supplementary Table 2, respectively. Uncropped versions of western blots from
main figures are shown in Supplementary Fig. 6.
Fluorescent immunohistochemistry. Lungs were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde
for 4.5 h at 4 °C, washed three times with cold PBS, incubated in 30% sucrose at 4 °
C overnight, and embedded in optimal cutting temperature (OCT). Frozen OCT
blocks were prepared using dry ice/ethanol baths and stored at −80 °C. Seven
micromolar sections were used for immunostaining with antibodies listed in
Supplementary Table 1. Secondary antibodies used are shown in Supplementary
Table 2. Images were taken using a Leica SP8-8X confocal microscope.
Intracellular flow cytometry. MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells were plated by
themselves or in co-culture with RAW264.7 macrophages. After 5 days, cells were
labeled with Zombie UV fixable viability dye (BioLegend), fixed and permeabilized
using Fixation/Permeabilization Solution Kit (BD Biosciences), and stained with
phycoerythrin-conjugated antibodies for IL1α or IL1β. Cells were analyzed on a BD
LSR II (Becton Dickinson). Information about the antibodies used is available in
Supplementary Table 1.
Quantitative real-time PCR. Total RNA was extracted using Quick-RNA
MicroPrep (Zymo) and reverse transcribed with iScript Reverse Transcription
Supermix (Bio-Rad), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. qPCR was
performed with a CFX96 Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad), using iTaq
Universal SYBR Green Supermix. Fold changes were calculated by the ΔΔCT
method, using 36B4 as the control. The primers used are shown in Supplementary
Table 3.
Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using the GraphPad Prism.
Data from at least three independent experiments are expressed as means ± SD
unless stated otherwise. Normal distribution was assumed and Student's t test was
applied for two-component comparisons, using Welch correction when groups
with different variances were compared. One-tailed statistical analyses were per-
formed in mouse experiments addressing the efficacy of a treatment in reducing
metastatic burden. Two-tailed analyses were used for other experiments. Con-
fidence level of 0.95% was used for all statistical analyses (α-value = 0.05). No
statistics was applied to determine sample size.
Data availability. All data generated or analyzed during this study are included in
this published article (and its Supplementary Information files).
