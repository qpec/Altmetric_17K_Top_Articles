Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of a multi-
modal hand hygiene intervention program in reducing health care insurance
claims for hygiene preventable infections (eg, cold and influenza), absentee-
ism, and subjective impact on employees. Methods: A 13.5-month pro-
spective, randomized cluster controlled trial was executed with alcohol-
based hand sanitizer in strategic workplace locations and personal use
(intervention group) and brief hand hygiene education (both groups). Four
yearsof retrospective datawerecollectedfor all participants. Results: Hygiene-
preventable health care claims were significantly reduced in the intervention
group by over 20% (P< 0.05). Absenteeism was positively impacted overall
for the intervention group. Employee survey data showed significant improve-
ments in hand hygiene behavior and perception of company concern for
employee well-being. Conclusion: Providing a comprehensive, targeted, yet
simple to execute hand hygiene program significantly reduced the incidence of
health care claims and increased employee workplace satisfaction.
I
t has often been estimated that a large portion of infections are
caused by hand transmission. Despite increasing awareness of
the importance of hand washing and a range of other hygiene
behaviors,1 many still become sick in the workplace, where viruses
and bacteria can survive for hours to months on inanimate surfaces,
for example, telephones and doorknobs, and spread to other indi-
viduals via direct or indirect contact.2,3 The typical office desk
harbors more than 10 million bacteria, 400 times more germs than
found on a standard toilet seat.4 High bacterial counts have been
detected on elevator buttons, office phones, water fountains, com-
puter keyboards, and vending machine buttons; particularly high
viral counts were detected on desks, computer mice, and phones,
especially in cubicles.5–7 Researchers swabbing 4800 surfaces in
office buildings found ‘‘officially dirty’’ readings were highest on
break room sink faucet handles (75% incidence of being dirty),
microwave door handles (48% incidence of being dirty), computer
keyboards (27% incidence of being dirty), and refrigerator door
handles (26% incidence of being dirty).8
Health-related work losses cost US employers more than
$260 billion each year,9 the indirect costs of poor health, most
notably absenteeism and attending work while sick (known as
‘‘presenteeism’’), exceed direct medical costs by two- to three-
fold.10,11 The total economic cost of the common cold in the United
States is estimated at $40 billion annually, only half of which is
attributed to missed workdays.12 This financial burden is greater
than that for many chronic conditions, including heart failure,
asthma, and emphysema. In addition, cold sufferers spend more
than $1.1 billion each year on antibiotic prescriptions, although
antibiotics have no effect on viral illnesses.12
Despite preventative efforts, including vaccination, influenza
epidemics exert considerable economic burden in the United States
for adults, much of this due to lost productivity.13 U.S. workers lose
approximately 3 days of work per influenza episode.14 Vaccination
effectiveness may be limited by the inability to adequately target all
circulating influenza virus strains; in the United States, vaccine
efficacy was just 19% during the 2014 to 2015 influenza season.15
Only 28% of workers in the United States get the flu vaccine, most of
themhealth careemployees.14A recentCochranereviewof90studies
found that influenza vaccination had no appreciable effects on work-
ing days lost or hospitalization.16 Public health agencies and various
policy groups stress the need to implement supplemental cost-effec-
tive strategies to prevent influenza infections in the workplace.14,17,18
The threat for infectious disease is high in the office setting
simply because employees work in close proximity and share eating
areas, workstations, and restrooms that harbor a broad spectrum of
microorganisms.6 U.S. adults spend more time Monday through
Friday at the workplace than anywhere else, including home, and
about one-third of all workers spend an additional 5 hours at the
office on weekends.7,19 The potential transmission of communica-
ble diseases is exacerbated by the trend toward open-floor plan
offices, which began in the 1990s and research suggests now applies
to approximately 70% of US employees.20 Compounding the risk is
that people work in closer proximity to each other, with the average
amount of space per office worker in North America shrinking from
225 square feet in 2010 to 176 square feet in 2012, with a projection
to be less than 100 square feet within 5 years.21 Workers sharing an
open space are at a significantly higher risk for absences than
occupants of private offices. A Danish national population-based
study found that occupants in open-plan offices of more than six
people had 62% more days of sickness absence.22 A large Swedish
2-year prospective study found a significant increase in short sick
leaves and absence due to illness for those in open versus private
offices.23 Workers in shared offices have, on average, two more
episodes of common cold than those in private offices.24
Unplanned absence is a very significant cause for concern in
controlling costs at the workplace and causes a high loss of
productivity. In a 2014 survey of 512 workers, it was learned that
unplanned absences have a significant negative impact on others
(69% believe it adds to the workload, 61% believe it increases stress,
59% believe it disrupts the work of others, and 48% believe it hurts

 morale at the workplace).25 Numerous factors are increasing the
financial impact of communicable disease for employers, including
higher prevalence of influenza in the aging workforce, increased
overtime for on-site employees due to absenteeism, and rising medical
costs,suchasinsurancepremiums.25–27Asof2011,themajority(86%)
of private sector employers in large companies (�1000 people) were
self-insured, and the trend to being a self-insured employer is grow-
ing.28 In a self-insured plan, the employer assumes the financial riskfor
providing health care benefits, paying out-of-pocket claims, as they are
incurred rather than fixed premiums to an insurance carrier.28 The cost
to insure an employee is rising, the average health care costs are
projected to increase to over $11,500 per employee in 2016, of which
the employer is projected to pay over $8800 per employee.29 Taken
together, these developments underscore the imperative to implement
simple, relatively low-cost, evidence-based strategies that prevent
infectious illnesses in the workplace.
Hand hygiene has been proven to be one of the most effective
means of reducing germ transmission in health care facilities and is
the cornerstone of infection prevention programs. The Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), World Health Organization
(WHO), and many other public health organizations issuing infec-
tion prevention guidance recommend alcohol-based hand sanitizers
as the first choice for hand hygiene practice in clinical settings when
hands are not visibly soiled30–33 and they are required upon hospital
accreditation inspections.34 These guidelines are based on a wide
body of evidence and studies that prove well-formulated alcohol-
based hand sanitizers rapidly and effectively reduce a broad spec-
trum of bacterial and viral counts on hands, transmission of patho-
gens, and hospital-acquired infections, including antibiotic-resistant
organisms such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
(MRSA). The Institute for Healthcare Improvement guideline sum-
marizes their status well: ‘‘alcohol-based hand rubs (liquids, gels, or
foams) are the preferred method for hand hygiene in most settings
due to the superior efficacy of these agents in rapidly reducing
bacteria counts on hands and their ease of use.’’33
Multiple studies demonstrate that implementing a hand
hygiene program with alcohol-based sanitizers outside of health
care settings significantly reduced illness-related absence and
increased hand hygiene compliance.35–38 Student use of alcohol
gel hand sanitizer in university dormitories reduced respiratory
illness by up to 40% and missed school days by 43%.37 In one
particularly successful program, implementing a ‘‘Buddies Hand
Washing Program’’ brief education module in elementary schools
combined with making alcohol-based hand sanitizers readily avail-
able reduced absenteeism by more than 50% (P < 0.001).36 In a US
Army basic training facility, installation of alcohol-based handwash
in mess halls and other strategic locations coupled with issuance of
pocket-sized bottles resulted in 40% less respiratory illness, 48%
less gastrointestinal illness, and 44% less lost training time.38
Currently, the military imposes a stringent hand hygiene protocol
for new recruits, including required use of customized alcohol-
based instant hand sanitizers.
To date, only a few studies examining hand hygiene programs
in the workplace have been reported in the peer-viewed litera-
ture.39–42 In a German study, city workers given alcohol-based hand
sanitizer experienced significant reductions in sick days and epi-
sodes of common cold, fever, and cough.39 Compliance remained
high over the course of the 1-year trial and at the conclusion, the
majority of participants favored continued use of the hand sanitizer
in the workplace and skin problems, including dryness, were rarely
reported.40 Another recent study in a US office building showed a
hygiene program, including an alcohol-based hand sanitizer and
disinfecting surface wipes, reduced viral transmission of a surrogate
organism introduced on employee hands, with significantly fewer
counts on hands and workplace surfaces (doorknobs, telephones,
computer mice, desk chairs) after the intervention.3 The sole
randomized prospective trial conducted in the United States, at a
Midwestern government office building, showed a significant 31%
relative reduction in self-reported acute respiratory illness, influ-
enza, and/or gastrointestinal infection after 3 months of use of an
alcohol-based hand sanitizer.41
The objective of our study was to evaluate the impact of a
comprehensive workplace hand hygiene program on health care
claims incidences and costs, absenteeism, and employee percep-
tions in the workplace. This is the first prospective study of a hand
hygiene intervention program, including an alcohol-based hand
sanitizer and sanitizing wipes at the employee’s desk, to analyze
for actual health care claims due to preventable illnesses with a
hand-to-mouth mode of transmission (eg, cold and influenza,
adenovirus, etc.).
METHODS
Study Design
The prospective, parallel-design, randomized cluster trial
was conducted in three highly populated office buildings for
employees in a Midwestern mutual health insurance company
(Medical Mutual of Ohio, Cleveland) over a more than 13-month
period from February 2014 through March 2015. The Chesapeake
Research Review Institutional Review Board (IRB) assessed the
study protocol and documentation, approved the study, and provided
appropriate oversight throughout the process. In an effort to start the
study during typical cold and flu season, baseline surveys were
administered in January 2014. This study was composed of two
clusters. The building with the most (782) employees was randomly
assigned (as a cluster) to the control group. The 604 employees in
the other two buildings (the second cluster) were consequently
assigned to the intervention group. Because the study was low risk in
nature, no consent forms were required.
All employees at the three facilities who were 18 years of age
or older, were enrolled in the company health insurance coverage,
did not transfer between sites and worked onsite full time
(�32 hours) were eligible for the study. The three buildings used
in the trial had a similar open floor plan with the majority of
employees sitting in cubicles. A small percentage (<15%) of
traditional-style offices with doors lined the outer perimeter of each
floor. The average amount of work space per worker in the
intervention site was 309 square feet, similar to the control site
at 323 square feet per worker. The intervention sites had a total
space of 276,000 square feet, and the control site had a total space of
381,000 square feet.
The primary endpoints were (1) the number of health care
insurance claims, for a defined set of preventable illnesses, per
subject per year, and (2) absenteeism, defined as the number of sick
episodes per subject per year. Sick episodes were calculated for each
employee based on unscheduled paid time off (PTO) events lasting
at least 4 hours. An unscheduled PTO event was defined as lasting at
least 4 hours, where an event was counted as a single occurrence,
whether the duration was 1 day or a series of consecutive unsched-
uled PTO days. This approach was chosen as the most accurate
measure to evaluate the trial’s hypothesis that alcohol-based hand
sanitizer usage prevented communicable illness, as opposed to
reducing severity of the illness, which is a different study question
and would best be evaluated by length of PTO. Secondary outcomes
focused on employee knowledge of appropriate hand hygiene
practice and satisfaction at the workplace, as assessed by a thorough
knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAPS) survey. Another sec-
ondary outcome was estimation of hand hygiene frequency by
employees in the intervention group. Historic data for health care
claims and absenteeism were compiled for each subject for the 4
years before the study (2010 to 2014), which allowed more robust
statistical analysis and higher confidence in conclusions.

 Employee Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices
(KAPS) Subjective Survey
The KAPS survey was administered to all participants before
the start of the trial (baseline) and 4 months into the trial (post
study). Employees were given two weeks to complete each survey.
The postsurvey was conducted at four months rather than later, for
example, at the study’s conclusion, to allow sufficient time for
employees to familiarize themselves with the hand hygiene pro-
gram, but not to allow so much time that their initial reactions to the
program would be lost.
The KAPS survey was a focused evaluation yielding quanti-
fiable data that measures change in KAPS in response to a specific
intervention. Questions included demographics, knowledge of, and
compliance with appropriate hand hygiene practice, perceptions and
usage of the alcohol-based hand sanitizer, concerns regarding illness
and cleanliness in the office, and impressions of the workplace
environment and its amenities.
An e-mail was sent to all employees in January, 2014, stating
that a hand hygiene research study was being conducted at the office
and participation was voluntary. An incentive of 25 wellness points
was offered to each employee who completed both the baseline and
poststudy KAPS survey. Employees at Medical Mutual of Ohio earn
wellness points for various health-related activities over the course
of the year. When a certain point threshold is reached, monetary
compensation toward health care premiums for the next year is
granted. The 25 additional wellness points for completing a hand
hygiene survey contributed to as much as 7% toward participating
employees attaining monetary compensation in the Medical Mutual
of Ohio 2014 Wellness incentive. Entry into a raffle for 1 of 100 $25
gift cards was offered as an added incentive for completing both
surveys. The baseline survey also included demographic infor-
mation and important covariates including age, gender, number
of people in household, number of children less than 17 years of age
in household, number of children in daycare, type of transportation
to work (car, car pool, public transportation, bike, walk or other),
and if employee received a flu vaccination in the fall of 2013.
Intervention Materials
On February 6, 2014, 11 days before the commencement of
data collection, hand hygiene supplies were placed in the offices of
the two intervention sites. Alcohol-based hand sanitizer (PURELL
Advanced, GOJO Industries Inc, Akron, Ohio) was installed in high
traffic common areas (eg, near elevators, at entrances) and other
appropriate public spaces, including the coffee area, break rooms,
conference rooms, training rooms, lobbies, and reception areas, as
wall-mounted dispensers, stands, or free-standing bottles (depend-
ing on the environment and space available). An 8-ounce bottle of
hand sanitizer (PURELL Advanced) and a 100-count canister of
hand wipes (PURELL Wipes) were delivered to each cubicle. Every
employee in the intervention group was also given a 1-ounce bottle
of hand sanitizer (PURELL Advanced) for personal use. Replenish-
ment product was stored in the supply room and made easily
available to individual employees upon request (a simple process
in case they ran out).
The restrooms in both the control and intervention sites
provided foam handwash (GOJO Green Certified Foam Handwash)
as well as an alcohol-based hand sanitizer foam wall-mounted
dispenser (PURELL, GOJO Industries) near the restroom exit,
which had been in place at all sites for months before the study.
This sanitizer product was not removed from the control group
restrooms during the study. We also ensured that the soap in all
restrooms was identical, so the quality or personal preference of
soap (which could impact usage behaviors) and hand hygiene
options at the restroom was not a variable within the study.
Hand Hygiene Education
The intervention and control groups received identical edu-
cation on hand hygiene and illness prevention. A brief (less than
one-minute) educational video about proper hand hygiene tech-
nique, for both washing and sanitizing hands, was embedded at the
end of the baseline online KAPS survey. The same signage to
‘‘Wash Your Hands,’’ promoting hand hygiene compliance, was
posted next to restroom exits at both the control and intervention
sites, and they were in place in advance of the study, not because of
the study. No additional such signage was placed at the
intervention sites.
Data Analysis
To evaluate health care claims, the International Classifi-
cation of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (‘‘ICD-9’’)
codes for illnesses with a hand-to-mouth mode of transmission (eg,
cold and influenza, adenovirus, etc.) were selected before the
implementation of the intervention.43 The study assessed 24 of
the most common and appropriate diagnosis codes for these com-
municable, hand-to-mouth transmitted diseases considered to be
preventable through effective hand hygiene (see Table 1).
The study included only paid facility (inpatient and out-
patient) and professional medical claims for dates of service from
February 17, 2014, to March 28, 2015, allowing for a three-month
claims run-out time period to increase accuracy and eliminate
invalid claims. Additional historical facility and professional claims
were also evaluated for trending, including claims from February
18, 2010, to February 16, 2014. Analysis and data extraction were
performed using SAS (Statistical Analysis System) software. Cold
and influenza claims were identified using the primary diagnosis
associated with each claim and evaluated by claim volume and cost.

 The number of employees to be included in this study was
calculated to detect a 20% reduction in the number of unscheduled
PTO events between the intervention and the control groups,
assuming a 0.05 P value and 80% power. Assuming an episode
sick rate of 0.7 for 6 months and taking into consideration intra-
cluster correction between the two groups and a potential non-
response rate of 10%, the sample size was estimated at 495
individuals for each group.
To compare the incidence of claims and absenteeism between
the two groups over time, a mixed-effects Poisson model was fit
separately to claims and absenteeism. The fixed effects in the model
were group (control or intervention), intervention period (pre- and
post-), and the two-way interaction. To account for repeated
measures from each subject, office building, and time period (1
to 6: five 12-month periods over the 4-year retrospective period and
the first year of the intervention, and an additional 1.5-month period
at the end of the study), random effects were included for time
period, building, and subject. The model accounted for the total
number of months worked by the employees in each group. Because
the data were zero-inflated and no significant correlation was found
among subjects in the same building, the data were aggregated by
group and the random effect due to office building, was dropped for
the final statistical analysis. Analyses were performed in R v.3.0.244
using packages lme445 and multcomp.46 One-tailed P values less
than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Statistical
analysis of the subjective survey data (KAPS) was done by Chi-
square, with P values less than 0.05 considered statistically signifi-
cant. Demographic variables were compared using Chi-square for
categorical variables and the Student t test for continuous variables.
RESULTS
A total of 1609 employees were asked to participate in the
study; 1386 were included in the study of claims and absenteeism
(782 in the control group and 604 in the intervention group); 1183
completed the baseline pre-study KAPS survey (627 in the control
group and 556 in the intervention group). The flow diagram for the
study population is shown in Fig. 1.
The two groups did not differ significantly in gender, age,
percentage receiving influenza vaccination, number of household
members, or number of households with children aged 16 years or
younger or in daycare. The only demographic profile characteristic
that was statistically significant was mode of transportation to work.
The finding that fewer employees in the control population drove
their own car and took public transportation was not surprising given
the more urban setting of that office building. Baseline character-
istic details of the participants are shown in Table 2.
During the first full year of the intervention period versus the
prior 12 months, the intervention group had a statistically significant
24.3% lower incidence of hand hygiene preventable health care
claims compared with the control group (P ¼ 0.016). When factor-
ing in the full 13.5-month intervention period and full 4 years of

 historical data, the intervention group still had a statistically sig-
nificant 20.9% lower incidence of claims than the control group
(P ¼ 0.030), which is an even stronger conclusion regarding the
efficacy and health outcome benefit of the intervention. The average
number of health care claims per employee was 0.30 in the
intervention group (179 claims among 604 subjects) compared with
0.37 for the control group (293 claims among 782 subjects). The
claims data comparing the two groups for the intervention period
and the four years before the study initiation is shown in Fig. 2. In
the year before the study began, the intervention group actually had
a 17.2% higher incidence of claims than the control group. If there
had been no effect of the intervention (ie, no interaction between
time and the intervention group), the claims rates would have risen
similarly to the control group. However, the actual incidence of
claims in the intervention group was 32.5% less than this prediction,
which was statistically significant (P ¼ 0.002).
For the second primary outcome measure of absenteeism,
during the first full year of the intervention period versus the prior
12 months, the intervention group had 7.7% less absences (unsched-
uled PTO) compared with the control group, which was not statisti-
cally significant (P ¼ 0.344). When factoring in the full 13.5-month
intervention period and full 4 years of historical data, the intervention
group had 5.0% less absenteeism episodes than the control group
(P ¼ 0.302). The average number of absences per employee in the
intervention group was 1.45 (875 episodes among 604 subjects)
compared with 1.53 for the control group (1193 episodes among
782 subjects). The absences data comparing the two groups for the
intervention period and the four years before the study initiation are
shown in Fig. 3. Analysis within the intervention group only was
executed because it was hypothesized that the survey and video may
have increased hand hygiene awareness of the control group. For the
intervention group only during the first full year of the intervention
period versus the prior 12 months showed employees with the
intervention had a statistically significant 13.4% lower incidence
of absences (P ¼ 0.012), whereas the control group during the same
one-year time interval had no significant change in absences. In the
year before the study began, the intervention group actually had a
7.3% higher incidence of absences than the control group. If there had
been no effect of the intervention (ie, no interaction between time and
the intervention group), the absence rates would have risen similarly
to the control group. However, the actual incidence of absences in the
interventiongroupwas 11.5%lessthan predicted thatwasstatistically
significant (P ¼ 0.030).
The average cost of each claim for the hygiene-preventable
illnesses included in both the control and intervention groups was
$104 for the intervention period versus an average of $89 for the
four years prior (see Table 3). In total, across the entire approxi-
mately five-year timeframe, the average cost per claim was $92. It
should be noted that the cost of the health care claims assessed in the
study does not necessarily translate into the severity of the illness,
that is, a lower cost of a claim should not be construed to mean that
the illness treated was less severe than a more costly claim. This is
due to the fact that multiple factors comprise the claim’s cost,
including type of facility visited (doctor’s office vs emergency
room, etc.), cost differences due to geography, variance in nego-
tiated contract rates by insurer with provider, etc.

 Table 4 assesses14companies’healthcareexpenditures across
a broad range of industries for the year 2013. The % of total costs for
the ICD-9codesanalyzedinthis studywasdetermined bycomparison
toeach company’s total health care cost.The % of total costsissimilar
across the employer categories, with a range of 0.7 to 1.6% and a
midpoint of 1.2%. Neither the size of the company nor the level of the
copay appears to have a notable effect on the result.
Hand hygiene knowledge at baseline did not differ between
the control and intervention groups (see Table 5). Knowledge of
hand hygiene practice was high, with at least nine in 10 employees
citing the need of hand hygiene in six of the nine situations
presented. Knowledge regarding technique and reason hand hygiene
is effective were also high and did not differ between control and
intervention groups.
Implementation of the program significantly improved self-
reported hand hygiene practice and attitudes in the intervention
group, with increased frequency of hand washing (self-reported),
employee satisfaction with office cleanliness, and perception that
company cared for their well-being and disease prevention in the
workplace (P < 0.05). At the intervention sites, the availability of
the product significantly increased participant’s sense of control of
their health/well-being, ability to interact with coworkers in the
workplace environment without worry about transmissible illness,
satisfaction with hand hygiene products provided by their employer,
likelihood to comply with optimum hand hygiene practice, and
overall positive impression of their company (P < 0.05).
Following introduction of an alcohol-based hand sanitizer in
the office, 40% more employees in the intervention group reported
cleaning their work area regularly to prevent illness compared with
both the baseline (P < 0.001) and control group (P < 0.001). The
intervention group was also significantly more likely to keep the
hand sanitizer with them and use it throughout the day—at work
(P < 0.001), home (P ¼ 0.017), and in public places (P ¼ 0.037),
such as grocery stores, malls, restaurants, health care facilities,
banks, and airports (see Fig. 4). Employees in the intervention group
reported significant increases in alcohol-based hand sanitizer use for
every activity assessed, including before eating (P ¼ 0.001), after
sneezing (P < 0.001), coughing (P < 0.001), handling money
(P < 0.001), using the restroom (P ¼ 0.005), returning to their desk
(P < 0.001), and interacting with others who may be sick
(P < 0.001).
Surprisingly, the availability of PURELL hand wipes at
individual desks had a stronger impact on workers’ impression
of the office space than many other amenities, including filtered
water, a recycling program, low-cost food, free coffee/soda, and
ATM/banking. A total of 81% employees in the intervention group
ranked the availability of alcohol-based hand sanitizer wipes at their
individual desk as one of the top two amenities in the workplace
compared with 69% before the intervention (P < 0.001) and 71% of
controls (P ¼ 0.001).
Employees in the intervention group were significantly more
likely than the control group to have a positive impression of
Medical Mutual of Ohio because of the presence of alcohol-based
hand sanitizers in the workplace (80% vs 69%, P < 0.001). There
was also a significant increase in employee perception that their
company was concerned about the spread of germs and illness in the

 workplace (80% vs 60%, P < 0.001). The intervention group
reported higher satisfaction with the overall cleanliness of the office
space than control group personnel as well (P < 0.001). Importantly,
88% of the employees in the intervention group postsurvey liked the
intervention products provided.
DISCUSSION
This is the first prospective workplace study evaluating a
comprehensive hand hygiene program with an alcohol-based hand
sanitizer to report actual medical insurance claims. The results clearly
demonstrate that intervention of a healthy office program with
provision of alcohol-based hand sanitizer throughout a building
and hand sanitizer along with hand wipes in the personal workspace
improves employee health outcomes and job satisfaction.
For the intervention group, there were significant increases in
frequency of hand hygiene for all activities assessed in the study.
The intervention group was significantly more likely to clean their
work area with sanitizing wipes as well as a surface spray (not
provided) in order to prevent illness. Increased hand hygiene
practice was documented in all of the settings recommended by
CDC guidance: after sneezing, coughing, and contact with others
who may be sick, before eating, and after use of the restroom.47 The
CDC states that hand hygiene is one of the best ways to reduce
absenteeism and avoid contracting and spreading illness in the
workplace and recommends that employers promote handwashing
among employees and their family.48 To prevent influenza in the
workplace, the CDC recommends that employers provide alcohol-
based hand sanitizers and gels when sinks and soaps are not
available and place handwashing reminders in bathrooms, kitchens,
break rooms, and other communal areas with sinks.17
Antibiotic resistance has grown into a crisis of alarming
proportion, with the hospital setting currently recognized by public
health agencies and the US government as posing an unacceptable
risk for infection; one of every 25 inpatients in acute care hospitals
in the United States contracts one or more infections.49,50 Each year,
in the United States, approximately 2 million people become
infected with drug-resistant bacteria, resulting in at least 23,000
deaths.51 Antibiotic-resistant pathogens cost the U.S. health care
system an estimated $20 billion each year.52 Moreover, few new
antibiotics are being invented, due to the expense and time it takes to
develop novel drug classes coupled with limited projected reve-
nue.53 Prevention of infections in any setting, including workplaces,
reduces the need for antibiotics and thereby reduces the risk of
developing antibiotic resistance.
According to the National Institutes of Health, the best
strategy to prevent the spread of drug-resistant bacteria is ‘‘for
everyone to keep their hands clean.’’54 Many leading professional
medical associations and the recently convened White House Task
Force on Antibiotic Stewardship also recommend prevention as one
of most important strategies to combat the crisis of antibiotic
resistance and rising health care costs.50,55 Hygiene and alcohol-
based hand sanitizers are an important modality in the fight to
combat antibiotic resistance, because, unlike other interventions,
there is no mechanism for bacteria to develop resistance to alcohol.
Alcohol kills bacteria by physically destroying the cell membrane
and denaturing proteins within the bacteria; doing so while evap-
orating from skin within seconds, leaving no residual active behind
that could lead to mutation.
Another important, yet often ignored aspect of hygiene is
product selection. Proper formulation of soaps, surface cleaners, and
alcohol-based hand rubs is required to maximize antimicrobial
efficacy and achieve satisfying human factors (eg, likeability, skin
feel, skin conditioning, etc.). It has been found that poor formulation
and delivery system design in hand soaps can lead to microbial
contamination and growth.56,57 A study of 12 hand sanitizer gel and
foam products evaluating antibacterial efficacy on hands found that
formulation matters and is a more important factor than alcohol
concentration alone.58,59 Therefore, it should not be assumed that
intervention with different hand hygiene products will produce
similar health benefits.

 As a corollary to product selection, this study sets out to
understand the impact the specific products and their placement had
on product usage. This was achieved through monitoring of product
shipments into the sites and physical collection of the soap, san-
itizer, and wipes products from the intervention sites at two times in
the study (evening collection with full replacement product was
provided, so there was no disruption of the intervention test con-
ditions). The collected samples were measured and usage rates were
estimated (given that the office worker could use product at their
desk or in the general work areas, the results should be considered
directional in nature). Our estimates suggest that an average
employee used the sanitizer 1.8 to 3.0 times per day, the soap
2.1 to 4.4 times per day, and the wipes at their desk 1.4 to 1.5 times
per week. These data suggest very reasonable, realistic levels of
usage, and contradict any notion that the positive health outcomes
were due to extremely high frequency of hand hygiene. Rather, an
average sanitizer usage rate of two to three times per day per
employee and sanitizing wipes usage rates of one to two times
per week per employee should be considered highly attainable and
fits well with expected behaviors (eg, to clean hands before eating,
after sneezing, etc.). Further study of the relationship of hand
hygiene rates and timing with health outcomes would be interesting.
The practice of attending work while sick, also known as
presenteeism, hinders employee productivity and has negative
economic implications. The estimated annual cost of presenteeism
caused by respiratory disorders exceeds $33 per employee.11
Although this study did not attempt to quantify the impact of the
hand hygiene intervention on costs linked to presenteeism, it is
reasonable to assume that the intervention’s demonstrated reduction
in health care claims would have a similarly positive impact on
reducing presenteeism costs caused by respiratory disorders. This is
especially relevant given that the hygiene-preventable infections

 assessed in this study do not frequently lead a person to seek
professional medical attention. In fact, frequency of doctor visits
for common cold-type illness has been reported to be as low as 4%.60
Workplaces share some of the same risks of health care
settings: employees work in close quarters, share open spaces,
are often a significant distance from sinks, and may be too occupied
with the task at hand to go to the restroom to wash their hands with
soap and water. Recommendations accrued from years of study of
hand hygiene techniques and compliance in health care settings are
now starting to be applied to other settings, such as schools,35–37
military,38 and more recently office based workplaces. Hospital-
based public health researchers have learned that a key factor
influencing adherence to optimum hand hygiene protocol is the
product’s availability at the point of need.32 The World Health
Organization promotes the alcohol-based handrub as the inter-
national standard of care for hand hygiene, as it is ‘‘the most
efficacious, well-tolerated and well-researched product which can
be placed ergonomically and safely at the point of care.’’32
Research accumulated over the past three decades shows that
well-designed wellness programs based on evidence-based prin-
ciples of health achieve significant positive health and financial
outcomes in the workplace, for both the employer and employees.
The impact is highest when programs emphasize a ‘‘culture of
health.’’61 A meta-analysis of 72 studies revealed that every $1 spent
on workplace wellness programs yielded an average return of
$3.50.62 A Harvard study found that, over a 3-year period, medical
costs fell by $3.27 for every dollar spent on wellness programs and
absenteeism costs fell by about $2.73 for every dollar spent.63
According to another meta-analysis evaluating 62 peer-reviewed
studies that met stringent inclusion criteria, worksite health pro-
grams reduce sick leave absenteeism by 25% on average and
worker’s compensation and disability claims costs by 32% on
average, with an overall $5.56 to $1 savings-to-cost ratio.64
There are some important limitations in our study. The control
group having more exposure to other people via public transportation
may have impacted employee health outcomes, but that is not well
understood. Other factors besides hygiene preventable illnesseslikely
contributed to absences, and it is well known that absenteeism, self-
reported or measured by unscheduled PTO as in this case, is an
ambiguous metric prone to error for a variety of reasons (eg, staying
home to care for a loved one, etc.). The rough estimation of actual
hand hygiene frequency in this study still does not determine what
level of hand hygiene is needed to reduce illnesses at an individual
level. Finally, the seasonal effects and relationship with this hygiene
intervention are not well understood. Further analysis should be done
with these data and future studies should attempt to better determine
whether health outcome results are different in the winter germ
season, during peak cold and flu season, or during the summer.
In summary, the simplest and most cost-effective strategy to
combat common infectious agents in the workplace is to provide
hand hygiene options at the point of exposure. Alcohol-based hand
rubs are more effective than routine hand washing in reducing viable
bacteria and viruses on hands, require less time to use, are more
accessible at the point of care, increase adherence to recommended
hand hygiene protocol, and cause less hand irritation and dryness
with repeated use than other products.32
CONCLUSION
This prospective, randomized, cluster-controlled trial dem-
onstrated that a healthy office program based on comprehensive
hand hygiene improvement at the individual employee level, used in
conjunction with alcohol hand sanitizers strategically placed in the
workplace, significantly reduced actual health care claims for hand
hygiene preventable infections (eg, cold and influenza). Further-
more, implementation significantly improved employee satisfaction
and hand hygiene knowledge and behavior. These findings support
the recommendations of many leading public health organizations
to implement hygiene programs as a key nonpharmaceutical
strategy to reduce the health and economic burden of illness and
reduce the risk of infection during work.
