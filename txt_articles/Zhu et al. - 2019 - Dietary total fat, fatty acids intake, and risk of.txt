of cardiovascular disease: a dose-response
meta-analysis of cohort studies
Yongjian Zhu1†, Yacong Bo2,3† and Yanhua Liu2*
Abstract
Background: Several epidemiological studies have investigated the association between dietary fat intake and
cardiovascular disease. However, dietary recommendations based on systematic review and meta-analysis might be
more credible.
Methods and results: Pubmed, Embase and Cochrane library were searched up to July 1st 2018 for cohort studies
reporting associations of dietary fat intake and risk of CVDs. By comparing the highest vs. the lowest categories of
fat or fatty acids intake, we found that higher dietary trans fatty acids (TFA) intake was associated with increased
risk of CVDs [RR:1.14(1.08–1.21)]. However, no association was observed between total fat, monounsaturated fatty
acids (MUFA), saturated fatty acids (SFA), and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), and risk of CVDs. Subgroup analysis
found a cardio-protective effect of PUFA in the studies that has been followed up more than 10 years [0.95(0.91–0.99),
I2 = 62.4%]. Dose-response analysis suggested that the risk of CVDs increased 16% [1.16 (1.07–1.25), Plinearity = 0.033] for
an increment of 2% energy/day of TFA intake.
Conclusions: This current meta-analysis of cohort studies suggested that total fat, SFA, MUFA, and PUFA intake were
not associated with the risk of cardiovascular disease. However, we found that higher TFA intake is associated with
greater risk of CVDs in a dose-response fashion. Furthermore, the subgroup analysis found a cardio-protective effect of
PUFA in studies followed up for more than 10 years.

Backgrounds
CVDs, caused by disorders of the heart and blood
vessels, are the leading cause of death globally [1]. It is
estimated that 17.7 million people, which represented
31% of all global deaths, died from CVDs in 2015 [1].
Unhealthy lifestyles, especially dietary habits, are be-
lieved to play an important role in the development of
heart disease [2–5]. National health institutions has tra-
ditionally recommended to reduce the intake of dietary
fat to prevent CVDs [6]. In addition, the intake of
trans-fat has been demonstrated to be associated with
health outcomes, and it is recommended to reduce its
consumption a minimum [7].
The mechanisms underlying the effects of dietary fat
on CVD remain uncertain. Dietary fat might contribute
to CVD via inflammatory and oxidative stress mecha-
nisms. Polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) can decrease
the production of inflammatory and reactive oxygen
species [8], saturated fatty acid (SFA) and trans fatty
acids (TFA) can increase pro-inflammatory and oxidative
stress [9, 10], excessive oxidative stress and inflamma-
tion contributes to the development of CVD [11, 12].
Several previous studies have investigated the relationship
between dietary fat and cardiovascular risk [13–16], the
PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea study (PREDIMED)
demonstrated that Mediterranean diets (MedDiets), which
were high in polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) and
monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA), low in saturated
fatty acid (SFA) and trans fatty acids (TFA), were asso-
ciated with reduced CVDs events compared with a low-fat
control diet [13]. The Japan Collaborative Cohort Study

 for Evaluation of Cancer Risk (JACC) Study showed that
SFA intake was inversely associated with mortality from
stroke [17]. However, the Lipid Research Clinics Pre-
valence Follow-up Study suggested that dietary MUFA
and PUFA intake were associated with reduced risk of
CVDs mortality and morbidity, whereas dietary intake of
trans-fat and SFA were associated with increased risk of
CVDs [14]. The Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiological
(PURE) study found that total fat and types of fat were not
associated
with
cardiovascular
disease,
or
mortality,
whereas saturated fat had an inverse association with
stroke. Global dietary guidelines should be reconsidered
in light of these findings [18]. However, in the develop-
ment of guideline, recommendations should be informed
by systematic review and meta-analysis of all evidences
and/or large randomized clinical trials. [19].
Thus, it is warranted to conduct a meta-analysis to
investigate the effect of dietary fat intake on CVDs risk.
In the current study, we summarized the evidence from
cohort studies of the relation of dietary fat intake and
CVDs risk, and evaluated the dose-response relationship
of CVDs and dietary fat intake.
Methods
Search strategy
Two members of the research team (Yonjian Zhu and
Yanhua Liu) systematically searched Pubmed, Embase and
Cochrane library up to July 1st 2018. The following key-
words were adopted: (dietary fat OR fat OR fatty OR
monounsaturated fatty acid OR polyunsaturated fatty acid
OR saturated fatty acid OR trans fatty acid) AND (Cardio-
vascular disease OR vascular disease OR ischemic heart
disease OR coronary heart disease OR Miocardial infarc-
tion OR Arrhythmia OR atrial fibrillation OR stroke OR
cerebral infarction OR cerebral hemorrhage OR Heart
failure OR Hypertension OR Cardiomyopathy).
Study selection
Two investigators (Yongjian Zhu and Yanhua Liu) inde-
pendently reviewed all identified studies, and studies were
included if they met the following criteria: (i) based on a co-
hort or nested case-control study design; (ii) the exposure
of interest were dietary total fat or major fat subclasses
(SFA, TFA, MUFA, or PUFA) intake; (iii) the outcomes of
interest were CVDs and (iv) relative risk (RR) or hazard
ratio (HR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) were reported
(we present pooled results with HR). If data were dupli-
cated in more than one study, the one with the most
recent or with the most number of cases was included.
Conflicts were resolved via a third author (Yacong Bo).
Data extraction
Two authors (Yanhua Liu and Yacong Bo) independently
extracted the following information: the surname of first
author, year of publication, cohort name, country, method
of assessing dietary fat intake, number of participation,
association between dietary fat intake and outcome (HR
or RR and 95% CI); the definition of outcome; and
potential confounding variables adjusted for HR (RR)
with 95% CI across increasing fat intake categories were
extracted preferentially or, where these data were not
available, risk estimates for continuous (linear) expo-
sures were extracted. Conflicts were resolved via a third
author (Yongjian Zhu).
Statistical methods
For the highest vs. the lowest dietary fat intake and CVDs
risk, we used the DerSimonian and Laird random effects
model to pool RRs and its 95% CIs from the adjusted HRs
or RRs. Subgroup and meta-regression analysis were
also performed based on geographical location (Amer-
icas, Europe, or other); follow-up duration (< 10 years
or ≥ 10 years); and whether the results were adjusted
for age, sex, physical activity, energy intake, alcohol,
smoking, or body mass index.
Potential publication bias was assessed by Egger’s test
(P < 0.05) [20, 21]. The sensitivity analysis was performed
by excluding 1 study at a time to evaluate whether the re-
sults could have been affected markedly by a single study.
For the dose-response association of dietary fat intake
and incident cardiovascular disease, the method of re-
stricted cubic splines with three knots at percentiles 25,
50, and 75% of the distribution was adopted [22]. The
studies included in doses-response analysis should report
the number of cases and person-years (or controls), and
the RR (or HR) with the variance estimates for at least
three quantitative exposure categories. If the distribution
of cases or person years was not reported, we estimated
them based on the quintiles definitions [23]. Moreover, we
assigned the median or mean fat intake for each category
to each corresponding RRs (or HRs) with 95% CI. When
means and medians were not reported, the category mid-
point would be used. When the lowest category was
open-ended, we set zero to the lowest boundary, and
when the highest category was open-ended, we set the
same width of the adjacent category to it [23].
All analyses were conducted using STATA software
(version 12.0; StatCorp, College Station, TX, USA) and a
value of P < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.
Patient and public involvement statement
Patients and the public sector were not directly involved
in this study.
Results
Literature search and study characteristics
The detailed procedures of the article search and screening
were presented in Fig. 1. Briefly, the search strategy
Zhu et al. Lipids in Health and Disease           (2019) 18:91 
Page 2 of 14
 retrieved 110,704 papers: 33,131 from Pubmed, 72,398
from Embase and 5175 from Cochrane library. After
removing 21,411 duplicate articles, 89,293 articles were
assessed. Among them, 89,114 articles were excluded after
reviewing abstracts and titles, leaving 179 articles for
full-text review. Of these, 136 papers were excluded due to:
no results provided the association between dietary fat/fat
subclasses and cardiovascular disease, duplicate publi-
cations, case-control studies, and only investigated fat from
breakfast. In total, 43 publications [14, 15, 17, 18, 24–62]
(63 studies, since 19 studies reported results for more than
one study) that presented risk estimates for dietary total fat
or major fat subclasses intake and CVDs risk were identi-
fied. The main characters of these studies are presented in
Additional file 1: Table S1.
Total fat intake and risk of CVDs
Forty-five studies reported the relationship between
total dietary fat intake and CVDs risk (CVDs incidence
and mortality). Highest versus lowest levels of total
dietary fat were not associated with the CVDs risk
[0.97(0.93–1.01), I2 = 54.0%; Fig. 2]. Sensitivity analysis
showed that no individual study had an excessive in-
fluence on the pooled effect. There was evidence of sig-
nificant heterogeneity (I2 = 54.0%), which was further
explored in meta-regression. All covariates investigated
in the meta-regression provided a poor explanation of
the heterogeneity. In addition, the analysis was repeated
stratified according to each covariate. The results were
consistent with that observed in meta-regression.
Subgroup analysis
As shown in Table 1, non-significant associations of total
dietary fat intake with cardiovascular risk were detected
in the subgroup analysis conducted by geographical
location (Americas, Europe, or Asia); follow-up duration
(< 10 years or ≥ 10 years); And whether the results were
adjusted for age, sex, physical activity, energy intake,
alcohol, smoking, or body mass index.
Publication bias
Egger test showed no evidence of significant publication
bias for this meta-analysis with cardiovascular risk and
total fat intake (t = − 1.01, P = 0.319).
Trans fatty acids intake and risk of CVDs
Twenty-four studies reported the effect of dietary TFA
intake on CVDs risk. Highest versus lowest levels of
dietary TFA were associated with increased risk of CVDs
[1.14(1.08–1.21), I2 = 26.1%; Fig. 3a]. Sensitivity analysis
showed that no individual study had an excessive in-
fluence on the pooled effect.

 Subgroup analysis
In subgroup analysis, the positive association between
dietary trans fatty acids intake and CVDs risk were ob-
served in most studies except those were not adjusted
for smoking and body mass index, and studies adjusted
for sex (Table 1).
Publication bias
Egger test showed no evidence of significant publication
bias for this meta-analysis with cardiovascular risk and
TFA intake (t = − 1.00, P = 0.330).
Saturated fatty acids intake and risk of CVDs
Fifty-six studies reported the association between dietary
SFA intake and CVDs risk. Highest versus lowest levels
of dietary SFA were not associated with the risk of CVDs
[0.97(0.93–1.02), I2 = 56.8%; Fig. 3a]. Sensitivity analysis
showed that no individual study had an excessive influ-
ence on the pooled effect. There was evidence of signi-
ficant heterogeneity (I2 = 56.8%), which was further
explored in meta-regression. All covariates investigated
in the meta-regression provided a poor explanation of
the heterogeneity. In addition, the analysis was repeated
stratified according to each covariate. The results were
consistent with that observed in meta-regression.
Subgroup analysis
As shown in Table 1, a significant inverse association was
observed in Asia population [0.84(0.73–0.97), I2 = 42.3%]
but not American and European population. No signifi-
cant associations were found for subgroups by follow-up
duration (< 10 years or ≥ 10 years), or whether the results
were adjusted for age, sex, physical activity, energy intake,
alcohol, smoking, or body mass index (P > 0.05).
Publication bias
Egger test showed no evidence of significant publication
bias for this meta-analysis with cardiovascular risk and
saturated fatty acids intake (t = − 0.28, P = 0.777).

 Monounsaturated fatty acids intake and risk of CVDs
Forty-three studies reported the relationship between diet-
ary MUFA intake and CVDs risk. Highest versus lowest
levels of dietary MUFA were not associated with the risk
of CVDs risk [0.97(0.93–1.01), I2 = 50.3%; Fig. 3b]. Sensi-
tivity analysis showed that no individual study had an ex-
cessive influence on the pooled effect. There was evidence
of significant heterogeneity (I2 = 50.3%), which was further
explored in meta-regression. All covariates investigated in
the meta-regression provided a poor explanation of the
heterogeneity. In addition, the analysis was repeated strati-
fied according to each covariate. The results were consis-
tent with that observed in meta-regression.
Subgroup analysis
Non-significant associations of dietary monounsaturated
fatty acids intake and cardiovascular risk were detected
in the subgroup analysis conducted by geographical
location (Americas, Europe, or other), follow-up duration
(< 10 years or ≥ 10 years), and whether the results were
adjusted for age, sex, physical activity, energy intake, alco-
hol, smoking, or body mass index (Table 1).
Publication bias
Egger test showed no evidence of significant publication
bias for this meta-analysis with cardiovascular risk and
monounsaturated fatty acids intake (t = − 1.45, P = 0.154).
Polyunsaturated fatty acids intake and risk of CVDs
Forty-five studies reported the effect of dietary PUFA in-
take on CVDs risk. Highest versus lowest levels of dietary
PUFA were not associated with the risk of cardiovascular
disease [0.97(0.93–1.004), I2 = 55.8%; Fig. 3b]. Sensitivity
analysis showed that no individual study had an excessive
influence on the pooled effect. There was evidence of
significant heterogeneity (I2 = 55.8%), which was further
explored in meta-regression. All covariates investigated in
the meta-regression provided a poor explanation of the
heterogeneity. In addition, the analysis was repeated strati-
fied according to each covariate. The results were consis-
tent with that observed in meta-regression.
Subgroup analysis
In subgroup analysis, a significant inverse association was
observed in the studies that has been followed up more
than 10 years [0.95(0.91–0.99), I2 = 62.4%] (Table 1). No
significant associations were found for the other sub-
groups analysis (P > 0.05).
Publication bias
Egger test showed no evidence of significant publication
bias for this meta-analysis with cardiovascular risk and
polyunsaturated fatty acids intake (t = − 1.74, P = 0.088).
Dose-response analysis
The dose-response analysis suggested non-significant
linear relationship between dietary total fat, SFA, MUFA,
and PUFA and CVDs risk [0.99(0.97–1.01), Plinearity =
0.164 and 1.01(0.99–1.02), Plinearity = 0.848 for an incre-
ment of 5% energy and 5 g/day of total dietary fat, re-
spectively;
0.99(0.95–1.04),
Plinearity = 0.474
and
0.98
(0.95–1.00), Plinearity = 0.526 for an increment of 5%
energy and 5 g/day of SFA, respectively; 0.96(0.91–1.02),
Plinearity = 0.471 and 1.00 (0.94–1.06), Plinearity = 0.256 for
an increment of 5% energy and 5 g/day of MUFA, respec-
tively; 0.92(0.84–1.01), Plinearity = 0.757 for an increment of
5% energy of dietary PUFA intake). However, the risk of
CVDs increased 16% [1.16(1.07–1.25), Plinearity = 0.033],
and 4% [1.04(1.01–1.07), Plinearity = 0.030] for an increment
of 2% energy of dietary TFA intake and 5 g/day dietary
PUFA intake, respectively (Figs. 4, 5, Additional file 2:

Discussion
This is the first study to investigate the effect of dietary
total fat and fatty acid intake on CVDs risk based on
dose-response meta-analysis of prospective cohort stu-
dies. Results from this meta-analysis did not detect any
relationship of dietary total fat, PUFA, MUFA, and SFA
intake with CVD risk. However, we found that dietary
TFA intake had a dose-response association with CVDs
risk. Subgroup analysis suggested inverse associations
between PUFAs intake and CVDs risk among studies
followed up for more than 10 years.
In contrast to popular accepted viewpoints, we did not
detect a positive association between total dietary fat
intake and CVDs risk. For decades, it has been believed
that fat intake was a risk factor for CVDs, based on the
presumption that dietary fat can increase low density
lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and blood pressure, there-
fore increase CVDs risk. This viewpoint might be based
on selective emphasis on some studies [25, 40, 47], but
ignore other studies that do not support these conclu-
sion [15, 36, 51]. Previous meta-analysis also suggested
no association between total dietary fat intake and endo-
metrial cancer [63], ulcerative colitis [64], and breast
cancer mortality [65], adding new information to re-
consider the recommendations of dietary guidelines to
reduce fat intake. Even though this study does not sup-
port the popular viewpoint that dietary fat intake could
increase CVDs risk, it is possible that the role of dietary
fat played in the development of CVDs might be con-
founded by the fat sources. For instance, vegetables and
fruits play protective roles in the development of CVDs.
However, we could not investigate the different effects of

 fat from animal, vegetables and fruit separately in this
current meta-analysis.
Skeaff et.al. found that dietary TFA intake can increase
risk of CHD mortality and incidence [1.32 (1.08–1.61,
P = 0.006) and 1.25(1.07–1.46) P = 0.007), respectively]
[66], which is consistent with our meta-analysis. The
potential mechanism might be via inflammation process
and blood lipids [67]. A recent randomized controlled
clinical (RCT) showed that the reduction in TFA intake
over 1 year was significantly associated with a reduction
in LDL particle number (LDL-P), a novel marker of
CVD risk [68]. The meta-analysis of 7 RCTs suggested
that increased TFA intake lead to an increase in total and
LDL-cholesterol and a decrease in HDL-cholesterol con-
centrations [69]. Some studies have also demonstrated
that increased TFA intake may impair insulin sensitivity
[70], increase soluble tumor necrosis factor alpha recep-
tors 1 and 2 (sTNF-R1, sTNF-R2, [71]), and C-reactive
protein concentrations [72].
We found no significant association between dietary
PUFA or SFA intake and CVDs risk, subgroup analysis
suggested that the relative risk of CVDs in the highest
compared with the lowest categories of PUFA intake was
reduced by 5% in studies that has been followed up for
more than 10 years, which suggested that the nonsignifi-
cant cardio-protective effect of PUFA might be ascribed
to the relatively short follow up duration. The non-sig-
nificant associations between PUFA and CVD risk
detected by a recent research conducted by PURE [18]
from five continents (mean follow up time:7.4 years)
might be also ascribed to the relative short follow up
time. All of these evidences demonstrated that studies
with longer follow up time are needed to clarify the
effect of dietary PUFA on CVDs risk.
The dose-response analysis suggested a linear relation-
ship between dietary TFA and the risk of CVDs. How-
ever, we found no evidence for the linear effects of
dietary total fat, SFA, MUFA intake on CVDs risk, sup-
porting the validity of the main analysis results that
there is no significant effect of total dietary fat, MUFA,
and SFA on the risk of CVDs. What’s surprising, the
dose-response analysis found a positive dose-response
relationship among studies based on dietary PUFA
intake as a g/day but not % of energy/day. Thus, we
studied each individual study that based on dietary PUFA
intake as a g/day respectively, finding only one study
showed a significant association between dietary PUFA
intake and CVDs risk [highest vs. lowest RR: 1.27
(1.00–1.61)], and the author suggested that the harmful
effect might be ascribed the high content of mercury in
local fish, a major source of PUFA. Further study adjusted
mercury exposure are needed to clarify the hypothesis.
Potential limitations to this study should also be con-
sidered. As common in meta-analysis, publication bias is
inevitable. However, the funnel plots and Begg’s test
suggested no significant publication bias through. In
addition, dietary data from most studies were collected
by FFQ, which may introduce measurement errors by
the over- or under-reporting of the amounts of food that
they usually eaten every day. Thirdly, covariates adjust-
ment could also influence the association between fat and
CVDs risk, although we extracted the risk estimates that
adjusted the greatest degree of potential confounders
which varied among different studies. Forth, we found
significant heterogeneity in our study. However, previous
studies suggested that when there are many studies with
large sample sizes, the I2 test may detect statistically
significant
but
clinically
nonsignificant
heterogeneity,
which may be the case in our study [73]. What’s more, we
also explored potential sources of heterogeneity through
subgroup and meta-regression analysis, which further
proves that our findings are robust.
Our analysis has several strengths. We limited our
analysis to prospective cohort studies to minimize the
influence of recall and selection biases that are common
in case-control studies. Moreover, we conducted a dose-
response curve instead of only comparing highest vs.
lowest fat consumers. The health effect of diet fat may
vary among different fat types. Therefore, it is another
strength to combine studies that have investigated the
effect of different major dietary fat types on CVDs.
Conclusions
This current meta-analysis of cohort studies suggested
that total fat, SFA, MUFA, and PUFA intake were not
associated with the risk of cardiovascular disease. How-
ever, we found that higher TFA intake is associated with
greater risk of CVDs in a dose-response fashion. Further-
more, the subgroup analysis found a cardio-protective
effect of PUFA in studies followed up for more than
10 years. Dietary guidelines taking these findings into
consideration might be more credible.
