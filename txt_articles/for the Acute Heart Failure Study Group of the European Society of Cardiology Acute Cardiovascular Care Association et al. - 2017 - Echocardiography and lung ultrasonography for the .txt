 Heart failure is the primary cause of hospital admis­
sion in >1 million patients per year in the USA, with 
25% of patients being readmitted within 1 month, and 
10–20% mortality at 6 months after discharge1,2. Acute 
heart failure (AHF) — either a new diagnosis in patients 
with no history of cardiac disease, or as a result of acute 
decompen 
sation in patients with known heart failure 
— is the leading cause of hospital admission in individ­
uals aged >65 years in the UK3. According to data from 
Europe, approximately 50% of these patients will be 
 
readmitted within 12 months, and 30% will be deceased 
at the 1­year follow­up4. Despite numerous clinical trials 
to assess optimal treatment and management strategies 
for patients with AHF, little improvement has been made 
in AHF outcomes in the past 30 years1,4,5, with manage­
ment decisions largely based on expert consensus rather 
than robust evidence. The burden of AHF is therefore 
substantial, both to individual patients and to society6,7. 
The successful management of patients with any acute 
condition involves early diagnosis, the identification 
of underlying reversible causes, and the implementa­
tion of effective therapies in a timely manner, all while 
avoiding harm; all these factors are associated with 
better in­hospital and short­term prognosis8. This 
Consensus Statement, prepared by the Acute Heart 
Failure Study Group of the ESC Acute Cardiovascular 
Care Association, reviews the existing and potential roles 
of echocardiography and lung ultrasonography (LUS) in 
the assessment and management of patients with AHF.
AHF: a diagnostic and management challenge
AHF is a syndrome rather than a diagnosis per se, caused 
by a wide array of pathologies that result in a spectrum 
of disease severity ranging from breathlessness to cardio­
genic shock or cardiac arrest. AHF is a highly lethal con­
dition, and studies have shown that minimizing the ‘time 
to appropriate therapy’ — the initiation of treatment as 
soon as possible, including in the prehospital setting 
— is potentially beneficial in improving outcomes9,10. 
AHF is variably defined as the rapid onset or acute

Abstract | Echocardiography is increasingly recommended for the diagnosis and assessment 
of patients with severe cardiac disease, including acute heart failure. Although previously 
considered to be within the realm of cardiologists, the development of ultrasonography 
technology has led to the adoption of echocardiography by acute care clinicians across a range 
of specialties. Data from echocardiography and lung ultrasonography can be used to improve 
diagnostic accuracy, guide and monitor the response to interventions, and communicate 
important prognostic information in patients with acute heart failure. However, without the 
appropriate skills and a good understanding of ultrasonography, its wider application to the most 
acutely unwell patients can have substantial pitfalls. This Consensus Statement, prepared by the 
Acute Heart Failure Study Group of the ESC Acute Cardiovascular Care Association, reviews 
the existing and potential roles of echocardiography and lung ultrasonography in the assessment 
and management of patients with acute heart failure, highlighting the differences from 
established practice where relevant.

 worsening of symptoms and signs of heart failure that 
is associated with elevated plasma levels of natriuretic 
peptides4,11. However, substantial diagnostic uncertainty 
is inevitable when relying only on traditional clinical 
findings, and currently a lack of specificity exists in rou­
tine investigations for this condition. Indeed, although 
patients often present with a suggestive history, clinical 
features (such as shock, and pulmonary or peripheral 
congestion), and/ 
or symptoms related to the under 
lying 
potential cause, these traditional clinical features are 
frequently absent; over­reliance on these factors might 
delay diagnosis and implementation of appropriate ther­
apy, or contribute to a missed diagnosis in up to 20% 
of patients12,13. Furthermore, patients’ clinical features 
might vary according to the site of initial medical contact 
and the management strategies employed14,15.
The majority of patients with AHF present to emer­
gency departments; however, many patient are also 
assessed and managed in other acute care settings such 
as in intensive care and inpatient cardiology units. 
Patients with AHF usually present with symptoms of 
congestion and breathlessness rather than cardiac arrest 
or shock16. Symptoms of breathlessness account for 
3–5% of emergency department attendances in Europe 
and the USA, and the major causes of breathlessness and 
their prevalence include AHF (50%), pneumo 
nia or 
bronchitis (20%), exacerbation of chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease or asthma (20%), and pulmonary 
embolism (5–10%)16,17. Current guidelines recommend 
that clinical examination and investigations should be 
integrated to form the diagnosis, including the use of 
electrocardiogram (ECG), chest radiograph, and bio­
markers such as natriuretic peptides, troponin, and 
D­dimer as indicated16,18,19. Unfortunately, these data 
can be challenging to interpret, in particular in the 
10–15% of patients in whom two concomitant diag­
noses exist1,4,20. Specifically, although included in the 
current definition of AHF, levels of natriuretic pep­
tides can be elevated in respiratory disease and other 
acute conditions such as pulmonary embolism, sepsis, 
and anaemia21–24.
Any acute condition can be further complicated 
by the external factors present in emergency settings, 
such as high ambient noise and restrictive space, limit­
ing a clinician’s ability to position the patient optimally 
for examination. Furthermore, the frequently atypical 
 
features of very severe pathology (in particular valvular 
disease), and the time pressures imposed by an acutely 
deteriorating patient can contribute to poor outcomes. 
These factors are further confounded by the presence 
of concomitant pathologies in the increasingly ageing 
patient population25.
Echocardiography and LUS are readily available and 
widely validated techniques that can be used to reveal 
anatomical and physiological abnormalities in patients 
with AHF, which when correctly applied in the acute 
setting, can improve patient assessment, management, 
and outcomes (FIGS 1,2)26. Unlike other biomarkers used 
in AHF, echocardiography and LUS can be used to 
identify not only inadequate cardiac output and/or the 
presence of congestion, but also the underlying cause, 
allowing the most appropriate, individual 
ized inter­
ventions to be delivered immediately to the patient27. 
Furthermore, these imaging modalities can be used to 
monitor the effects of treatment (either beneficial or 
detrimental), as well as to guide patient disposition and 
interventions as indicated28. Pocket­sized echocardio­
graphy devices are practical for screening, and provide 
information to clinicians in addition to that gath­
ered from auscultation by a stethoscope alone. When 
AHF is suspected, an integrative approach is recom­
mended, including determination of cardiopulmonary

Key points
• Over-reliance of traditional clinical findings and symptoms can potentially delay 
diagnosis of acute heart failure (AHF), prolonging the time to appropriate therapy
• The use of echocardiography and lung ultrasonography can help to improve 
diagnostic accuracy and monitor responses to interventions in patients with AHF
• Lung ultrasonography allows for rapid assessment of numerous conditions, 
including pulmonary oedema, pleural effusion, and pneumothorax
• Use of echocardiography has extended beyond the traditional application in stable 
patients to become widespread in the acute and emergency settings
• In the setting of AHF, echocardiography can be used to assess pericardial effusion, 
right ventricular dilatation, left ventricular systolic function, gross valvular abnormality, 
and potentially the presence of intracardiac masses
• Echocardiography can also be used to monitor treatment in patients with cardiogenic 
shock

 instability and evaluation of congestion (pulmonary 
and peripheral) using a combin 
ation of techniques4. 
When image quality is  
inadequate, either trans­
oesophageal  
echocardiography or the use of  
contrast 
should be considered.
Lung ultrasonography
Based on the interpretation of a number of artefacts, spe­
cific ultrasonography appearances, and their distrib 
ution 
(FIG. 1), LUS allows for a rapid point­of­care evalu 
ation of 
a number of conditions, including pulmonary oedema, 
lung consolidation, pleural effusion, and pneumo­
thorax29. High intra­rater and inter­rater reproducibility, 
ease of learning, short exam dur 
ation (<5 min), and the 
noninvasive nature of this technique makes it an advan­
tageous point­of­care tool30–32. LUS is increasingly used 
in the acute care setting, and has improved diagnostic 
accuracy compared with clinical assessment and chest 
radio 
graphy for the identification of a  
cardiac aetiology 
in patients presenting to the  
emergency  
department with 
undifferentiated dyspnoea33.
Interstitial fluid and pulmonary oedema
Quantification of B­lines (vertical artefacts that result 
from an increase in interstitial density; FIG. 1b) has been 
shown to be useful for the diagnosis, monitoring, and 
risk assessment of patients with known or suspected 
AHF34–36. Either curvilinear or phased array trans 
ducers 
can be used, typically at an imaging depth of 18 cm. 
Although the assessment of eight or more anterior and 
lateral thoracic zones (four on each hemithorax) has 
been recommended in a consensus statement29, a sub­
sequent study demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy 
with examination of only six thoracic regions33. The 
visualization of three or more B­lines in two or more 
intercostal spaces bilaterally should be considered 
diagnostic for pulmonary oedema, with sensitivity of 
94% (95% CI 81–98%) and specificity of 92% (95% CI 
84–96%)33,37. By contrast, physical examination and 
chest radiography have a sensitivity of only 62% (95% CI 
61–64%) and 57% (95% CI 55–59%), and a specificity 
of 68% (95% CI 67–69%) and 89% (95% CI 88–90%) 
for a diagnosis of pulmonary oedema, respectively38. 
The presence of multi 
ple bilateral B­lines in AHF has 
been well­ 
correlated with natriuretic peptide levels, 
and only variably correlated with pulmonary capillary 
wedge pressure and measures of extravascular lung 
water30,33,35,39–41. Given that studies to assess the incre­
mental diagnostic value of LUS compared with natri­
uretic peptides for the identification of AHF in patients 
with dyspnoea reported variable results in different 
cohorts, this topic warrants further investigation31,33,42. 
The  
number of B­lines is thought to decrease with treat­
ment for AHF and, therefore, this technique is poten­
tially useful in the monitoring of pulmonary oedema in 
response to therapy35,36. For serial assessments, patient 
positioning (sitting versus supine) should be kept 
consistent43. Importantly, a higher number of B­lines 
on LUS at the time of discharge from hospital might 
help to identify patients with heart failure who have a 
worse prognosis36.

Notes and potential pitfalls
ACS and 
ischaemic heart 
disease
Dyspnoea, 
as atypical 
presentation 
of ACS
• Standard RWMA
• Abnormalities on transmitral 
Doppler imaging
• Transient ischaemia: echo might be normal
• RWMA not specific for coronary disease
• Contrast might improve diagnostic accuracy in critically ill patients
Shock
• LV dysfunction
• EF influenced by volume, loading, and inotropic status
• Normal or hyperdynamic left ventricle in unstable AMI implies 
potential mechanical complication
Severe MR:
• primary (papillary muscle 
rupture and dysfunction)
• secondary (leaflets normal, 
but associated with RWMA)
• Easy to underestimate degree of LV dysfunction
• In very severe MR, colour Doppler might underestimate severity
• Complete or partial papillary muscle rupture
• Secondary MR can be dynamic 
• Ventricular wall rupture: 
only evidence is pericardial 
collection (30% of patients)
• Detection of pericardial collection should prompt careful scanning 
for rupture
• Inferior collection of blood can be challenging to differentiate from 
liver (similar echo characteristics)
Ventricular septal rupture:
• 2D defect in area 
of infarction with 
corresponding colour 
Doppler
• Can be multiple
• Easy to underestimate degree of LV dysfunction and extent 
of infarction
• Substantial left-to-right flow in diastole is an indication of high LV 
diastolic pressure
• RV infarct: features of inferior 
MI ± RV dyssynergy and 
paradoxical septal motion
• Suspected if TR is low velocity, but PR has steep pressure half-time
• Assessment of LV function can be challenging, owing to reduced 
preload
• Extent of LV dysfunction might be revealed if RV MCS is used
Myocarditis
Widely variable, 
might be within 
AHF spectrum
• Nonspecific: LV systolic and 
diastolic dysfunction, resting 
RWMA, and nonspecific 
changes in image texture
• Additional features: thrombi, secondary MR/TR, pericardial 
involvement
• More fulminant: thickening of myocardial walls (oedema)
• Speckle tracking: reduction in GLS correlates with myocardial 
inflammation (but nonspecific for the disease)
• Real-time low-mechanical index MCE might be helpful

syndrome
Widely variable, 
might be within 
AHF spectrum
• Reversible LV dysfunction 
with RWMA extending 
beyond coronary territory 
distribution
Echocardiographically more heterogeneous than originally described
• Biventricular involvement in 25%
• Midsegment involvement in 40%
Dissection
Shock
• Dissection flap, varying 
degrees of AR, and RWMA 
from coronary involvement
• Normal TTE does not exclude dissection
• AR might be overestimated if dissection flap prolapses through 
aortic valve
Cardiomyopathy
Full spectrum of 
AHF
• Doppler evidence of elevated 
filling pressures
• LUS might show pulmonary 
oedema
• EF influenced by volume, loading, and inotropic status
• RWMA might occur in absence of coronary disease
• GLS potentially useful (≤10% indicates severe reduction)
• GLS and STE not well-validated in acute settings and in the context 
of positive inotropic agents
• HCM: standard echo features, 
including estimation of 
PASP and LAP
, plus degree 
of LVOTO
• Severity of LVOTO might be dynamic and worsen with positive 
inotropic agents and/or hypovolaemia
• Worsening MR might be dynamic 
Pulmonary 
embolism
Full spectrum of 
AHF
• Dilatation of right heart, 
RV hypokinesia, abnormal 
interventricular septal motion
• Diagnostic: mobile 
serpentine thrombus in right 
heart/pulmonary artery
• Findings nonspecific for pulmonary embolism
• Expect to see high PVR
• In shock, normal right heart virtually excludes pulmonary embolism 
as the cause
• Very severe RV dysfunction might underestimate degree of 
pulmonary obstruction
• Very severe TR might underestimate degree of pulmonary 
hypertension
Pneumothorax
From dyspnoea to 
cardiac arrest
• Absence of pleural sliding
• Demonstration of lung point 
is diagnostic
• If tension pneumothorax suspected in cardiac arrest, treatment 
should not be delayed for LUS
• In right mainstem intubation, expect absent lung sliding on left 
hemithorax

 Pleural effusion
Similarly to B­lines, the presence of pleural effusions 
can be assessed using curvilinear or phased array trans­
ducers in the posterior–axillary line34 (FIG. 1d). Current 
data regarding the diagnostic utility of pleural effusions 
identified on ultrasonography in patients with AHF are 
less robust, but have been reported with sensitivities 
of 79–84% and specificities of 83–98% in small studies of 
patients with dyspnoea44,45.
Pneumothorax
LUS can be used to exclude pneumothorax in the area 
scanned with higher sensitivity than supine chest radio­
graphy by recognizing lung sliding, a slight horizon­
tal movement of the pleural line with respiration; see 
Supplementary information S1 (video)46. In the set­
ting of a pneumothorax, lung sliding is absent in the 
affected area of the chest. At the border of a pneumo­
thorax, a transition point between normal lung surface

Valve disease
Mitral 
regurgitation; from 
dyspnoea to shock
• Severity assessed according 
to standard echo parameters 
(integrated approach)
• Underlying causes: ischaemia, 
endocarditis, trauma, heart 
failure
• Must include cardiorespiratory support: PPV and pharmacological 
agents can reduce severity significantly 
• Almost always severe in context of papillary muscle rupture
• Colour Doppler might underestimate severity if valve disease is very 
severe owing to rapid equalization of pressures
• Early truncation of MR velocities is a useful sign
• Suspect in patients with hyperdynamic left ventricle and pulmonary 
oedema
• Premature closure of MV (with diastolic MR) implies catastrophic 
regurgitation
• If endocarditis suspected, and TTE is nondiagnostic, TOE should 
be performed 
Aortic 
regurgitation; from 
dyspnoea to shock
• Severity assessed according 
to standard echo parameters 
(integrated approach)
• Underlying causes: dissection, 
endocarditis
• Short PHT (<200 ms)
• Diastolic flow reversal in descending aorta (EDV >20 cm/s)
• Premature diastolic opening of aortic valve implies catastrophic 
regurgitation
• Care in evaluation if considering ECMO; even mild degrees of AR 
might be important (and preclude peripheral ECMO). No aortic valve 
opening with use of ECMO suggests further LV decompression might 
be indicated
Mitral stenosis; 
might mimic ARDS
• Severity assessed according 
to standard echo parameters 
(integrated approach)
• Acute deterioration might be caused by physiological (pregnancy) 
or pathological (arrhythmia) precipitant
• Might see pulmonary infiltrates even in not very severe disease 
if in combination with lung injury
Aortic stenosis; 
from dyspnoea to 
shock to cardiac 
arrest
• Severity assessed according 
to standard echo parameters 
(integrated approach)
• Care in evaluation in presence of peripheral ECMO, becausee 
increase in afterload might reduce aortic valve opening
• Contraindication to Impella (Abiomed, USA)
Valve prosthesis 
dysfunction; from 
dyspnoea to shock
• Echo features of valve 
dysfunction
• Underlying causes: thrombus, 
pannus, endocarditis, 
dehiscence, degeneration 
• Normalization of septal motion should raise suspicion
• Consider if pulmonary infiltrates and ‘good’ or hyperdynamic left 
ventricle in patient with previous AV/MV replacement
• Indication for expert TOE
• Increased transvalvular velocities must be interpreted in context of CO
Sepsis
Clinically septic, 
but inadequate CO
• Frequently hyperkinetic
• Pulmonary hypertension: 
degree of RV dysfunction not 
uncommon (30%)
• LV/biventricular dysfunction 
might occur
• If sepsis accompanies pneumonia and venovenous ECMO 
anticipated, take care to assess right ventricle as it might not tolerate 
volume load
• Intracardiac source of sepsis might be present (related to line, device, 
or valve)
• Speckle tracking proposed (not validated in adults) to identify early 
sepsis-related dysfunction
Tamponade
Dyspnoea to shock 
to cardiac arrest
• Demonstration of 
accumulation of fluid in 
pericardial space with 
or without features of

• Small collections occurring rapidly can result in tamponade
• Localized collections/presence of cardiac or pulmonary disease 
might suppress features of tamponade

 (with lung sliding) and pneumothorax (without lung 
sliding) can sometimes be identified47. This so­called 
‘lung point’ confirms the diagnosis. Lung sliding might 
be absent in several other pathological conditions 
(such as pleural adhesions or selective mainstem intuba­
tion) and, therefore, should not be used in isolation to 
make the diagnosis of pneumo 
thorax, but rather in 
 
conjunction with the full range of sonographic features46.
Differential diagnosis and potential pitfalls
The major questions when using LUS for the assess­
ment of patients with possible AHF include whether 
there is evidence of pulmonary oedema (such as 
multi 
ple  
bilateral B­lines), whether there are other 
findings suggestive of AHF (such as pleural effusion), 
and finally, whether there are findings of alternate or 
concurrent conditions (such as pulmonary consolid­
ation or pneumo 
thorax). Despite its apparent simpli­
city, a  
number of caveats exist for the use of LUS. First, 
B­lines can resolve rapidly in response to treatment, and, 
therefore, LUS data must be interpreted in the context of 
previous interventions35. Second, B­lines can be seen in 
a number of pulmonary conditions, including pulmo­
nary fibrosis or interstitial lung disease, acute respiratory 
distress syndrome, and pneumonitis29. The observa­
tion of B­lines together with other LUS abnormalities 
might indicate that two patho 
logies coexist, or that 
the B­lines are an expression of pathology other than 
AHF (for example, acute respir 
atory distress syndrome, 
or pulmonary oedema in patients receiving haemo­
dialysis)48. Third, large pleural effusions might inter­
fere with B­line quanti 
fication in the affected thoracic 
zones and induce lung consolidation (FIG. 1d). Together, 
these considerations outline why LUS should not be 
used in isolation, but rather integrated into clinical and 
laboratory  
assessment33,49,50.
Echocardiography in AHF
Driven by progressive advances in ultrasonography 
technology and an expanding evidence base, the use of 
echocardiography has extended beyond the traditional 
application in stable patients to become widespread in 
the acute and emergency settings51,52. Mirroring the 
concept of critical care, echocardiography is increas­
ingly used as a tool to guide management of the most 
acutely unwell patients wherever they present along 
the management pathway. Pocket­sized devices have 
been recommended in the emergency department, 
intensive care unit, and coronary units for fast initial 
qualitative screening of ventricular and valvular func­
tion, pericardial and pleural effusion, or extravascular 
lung water. However, owing to the known limitations 
of this technique, they are not intended as a substitu­
tion for comprehensive echocardiography26,53. Remote 
expert review of images is now a possibility, and in the 
future, telemedicine will probably have an important 
role in guiding the assessment and management of these 
acutely unwell patients.
Echocardiography is used in AHF to help to confirm 
diagnosis, delineate potential underlying causes, identify 
associated pathophysiology, and monitor the response 
to therapy28,54. Echocardiography can also be used to 
guide specialist interventions in the catheter laboratory 
or operating room55–57. Furthermore, echocardiography 
can address several major questions, including whether a 
patient has a cardiac cause for their symptoms and signs, 
the severity of the cardiac impairment and its physio­
logical effect, whether there is an underlying reversible 
cause, what the most appropriate initial treatment is, and 
how the patient responds to treatment.
Guidelines recommend immediate echocardio­
graphic assessment for patients with suspected AHF 
with haemo 
dynamic instability1,4; however, interpreta­
tion of echocardiographic data in these acutely unwell 
patients can be extremely complex (TABLE 1). First, 
the finding of a structurally or functionally abnormal 
heart does not necessarily mean the cause of dyspnoea 
is cardiac­ 
related. Second, patients might be misdiag­
nosed as having primary respiratory disease, even in 
the presence of very severe cardiac pathology27,58. Third, 
substantial cardiac and respiratory disease might coexist, 
and determining the degree of cardiac contribution is 
frequently challenging in this setting59. These consider­
ations are further compounded by the relative paucity 
of high­quality evidence to support the use of echo­
cardiography techniques in the acute arena, as they have 
been predominantly  
validated in the outpatient clinic.

 Left-sided disease and elevated LAP
Dyspnoea resulting from left­sided cardiac disease is 
likely to be associated with elevated left atrial pressure 
(LAP) and pulmonary oedema. Historically, pulmo­
nary capillary wedge pressure has been measured using 
a pulmo 
nary artery catheter as a substitute for LAP 
measurement60–62. The use of the pulmonary artery cath­
eter has greatly declined over the past decade, owing to 
a number of studies that showed potential harm or no 
improved outcomes in the perioperative and critical care 
settings63. Although absolute pressure values cannot be 
measured using echocardiography, a drive has occurred 
to find an echocardiography­ 
derived parameter that can 
be used to estimate the LAP noninvasively. Indices that 
have been proposed include interrogation of the trans­
mitral left ventricular (LV) filling pattern (E/A ratio, 
E wave deceleration time, and the isovolumic relaxation 
time), pulmonary venous Doppler diastolic deceleration 
time (FIG. 2), M­mode colour Doppler propagation veloci­
ties, the time interval between the onset of early diastolic 
mitral inflow (E) and annular early diastolic velocity (eʹ) 
by  
tissue Doppler imaging, and the E/eʹ ratio64–69. None of 
 
these measures has been well­validated in the context 
 
of emergency medicine70,71; they all present technical chal­
lenges that must be carefully considered for accurate inter­
pretation, and provide only estimates of a potential range 
of corresponding LAP values. Even when used in combin­
ation (as proposed in critical care), they can at best only 
indicate that the LAP is probably very high or normal.
LV ejection fraction has been the main parameter 
used for the diagnosis, treatment, and stratification of 
patients with heart failure. However, this parameter has 
several limitations that are particularly relevant in the 
acute setting, such as load­dependency and inotropy­ 
dependency72,73. Even in the absence of high­quality 2D 
images, Doppler abnormalities in transmitral filling might 
provide an early indicator of important pathology72,74–76.
Unlike LUS, echocardiography might be challenging to 
perform well and interpret accurately, as a number of con­
siderations add to the complexity of its application in the 
acute setting. First, in all parameters described for LAP 
estimation, the confounding factors imposed by critical 
illness (changes in heart rate, cardiac output, LV compli­
ance, and volume and ventilatory status) have not been 
fully evaluated. Second, not only might patients with a 
relatively normal LAP have radiographic and sonographic 
evidence of pulmonary oedema, but conversely, patients 
with chronically elevated LAP might have no evidence of 
pulmonary oedema. Similarly to LUS, however, the echo­
cardiographic findings should be integrated with those 
from clinical examination, laboratory investigations, and 
lung imaging data (radiographic and/or sonographic), 
and be assessed within the clinical context. The main 
value of echocardiography in this setting is to diagnose 
or exclude an underlying cardiac cause for dyspnoea and 
guide subsequent interventions.
Right-sided disease: pulmonary embolism
The diagnosis of pulmonary embolism can be challeng­
ing, because symptoms and signs are non 
specific. The 
transthoracic echocardiogram is normal in approx 
imately

 50% of unselected patients with acute pulmonary embo­
lism, and has a sensitivity of 50–60% and speci 
ficity of 
80–90%77. Therefore, other investigations are used to 
confirm the diagnosis, with echocardiography used as 
a complementary imaging technique19. The principal 
indirect echocardiographic findings are nonspecific, 
and include right heart dilata 
tion, right ventricular (RV) 
hypokinesis (with or without apical sparing), abnormal 
septal motion, and inferior vena cava dilatation78 (FIG. 3a). 
Secondary tricuspid regurgitation might be present, 
allowing estimation of pulmonary arterial systolic pres­
sure using the simplified Bernoulli equation79 (FIG. 3b). 
Given that the right ventricle can generate a pulmo­
nary artery systolic pressure of only ≤60 mmHg acutely, 
a higher pressure suggests a more chronic process 
(either multiple repeated episodes or chronic pulmo­
nary parenchymal disease, with or without pulmonary 
embolism)80. Although the peak tricuspid regurgitation 
gradient is the most commonly used parameter to assess 
pulmonary artery systolic pressure in clinical practice, 
difficulties in the detection of good tricuspid regurgita­
tion envelope might occur. Pulsed Doppler recordings 
of pulmonary valve flow acceleration time, pre­ 
ejection 
period, and ejection time at the RV outflow tract can 
also be used to estimate pulmonary artery pressure 
 
and resistance81,82.
Pericardial collection and tamponade
Echocardiography is pivotal for recognition of the haemo­
dynamic consequences of a pericardial collection (FIG. 3c), 
allowing demonstration of features of tamponade includ­
ing right atrial and/or RV diastolic collapse, in addition 
to guiding pericardiocentesis83. A number of potential 
pitfalls exist when interpreting the echocardiographic 
features of tamponade in the acute setting. These pitfalls 
include the effects of positive pressure ventilation (reversal 
of changes in transvalvular flows) and localized collec­
tions, in particular after cardiac surgery when substantial 
haemodynamic compromise might be present, even in the 
absence of echocardiographic features of tamponade84.
Monitoring of therapy
Echocardiography is not recommended for the monitor­
ing of therapy in patients with AHF in the absence of 
cardio 
genic shock4,9,11, given the complexity of LAP 
estim 
ation using echocardiography, its lack of associ­
ation with pulmo 
nary congestion and symptoms, and 
superior 
ity of natriuretic peptide levels in monitoring 
response to therapy. An emerging area in which echo­
cardiography might be of use is in risk stratification 
before discharge from hospital. In patients with AHF 
with dyspnoea, persistent pulmonary congestion before 
discharge (demonstrated on LUS) has been shown to be 
an independent predictor of rehospitalization for AHF at 
6 months after discharge36.
Cardiogenic shock
Cardiogenic shock is the most severe manifestation of 
AHF. Although relatively uncommon, the published 
prevalence (5% of patients with AHF) varies according 
to the point of initial contact and management (1–2% 
of patients with AHF in the prehospital or emergency 
setting versus 29% in intensive care)4,9,10,16. Precise defin­
itions of cardiogenic shock can vary; however, the syn­
drome generally results from inadequate cardiac output 
for peripheral organ requirements85,86. Cardiogenic 
shock can manifest as hypotension despite adequate fill­
ing (with or without vasopressors), altered mentation, 
cool peripheries, oliguria, hyperlactataemia, metabolic 
acidaemia, and low mixed venous oxygen saturation86. 
In addition to standard evaluation of critically ill patients 
in parallel with resuscitation, echocardiography is man­
dated immediately in patients with cardiogenic shock, 
because without identification and treatment of the 
underlying cause, the outcome is usually fatal9,85 (FIG. 3d). 
Additional information that should be obtained from 
echocardiography includes estimation of stroke volume 
and cardiac output levels, because these data can provide 
guidance on how to maximize the cardiac output at the 
lowest filling pressures (see Supplementary information 
S2 (table)). These measurements should be taken during 
the echocardiogram, and should be performed repeatedly 
to monitor the response to therapeutic interventions and 
minimize potentially injurious treatment. Every study 
must be interpreted in the context of the level of ino­
tropic and ventilatory support, as well as metabolic and 
 
arterial blood gas status, because these variables might 
have  
profound effects on echocardiographic findings.

 Assessment of volume status. The physiological basis 
of providing ‘optimal’ filling in cardiogenic shock is 
that a critical decrease in intravascular­stressed volume 
reduces the difference between mean systemic venous 
and right atrial pressure, thereby limiting stroke vol­
ume. Although frequently used, invasive static pressure 
monitoring is not helpful for determining whether an 
individual patient is volume­responsive87,88. Static echo­
cardiographic para 
meters are widely used to predict 
volume responsiveness in critically ill patients (FIG. 4); 
however, their use requires that a number of strict  
criteria 
 
(relating to the patient, their underlying pathology, 
and medical interventions) are met, otherwise the 
investigation becomes invalid (see Supplementary 
information S3 (table)). Similarly, although thought to 
be superior, dynamic echocardiographic para 
meters 
to predict volume responsiveness are valid only in fully 
mechanically ventilated patients in sinus rhythm and 
without chronic heart disease89. In the presence of car­
diac disease (either left­sided and/or right­sided), these 
measurements can be misleading and should not be 
used. Conversely, toler 
ance to volume loading among 
different patients is vari 
able. The conventional teaching 
to increase volume in RV failure has not been upheld by

 findings published in the past 3 years90,91. Physiological 
models suggest that in some patients, progressive fluid 
loading leads to a plateau 
ing of cardiac output, with a 
progressive increase in pulmonary artery occlusion pres­
sure. In addition, higher volume is  
associated with worse 
outcome in critically ill patients92–94.
Inotropes and vasoactive agents. Although inotropes 
and vasopressors are commonly used to improve car­
diac output and blood pressure in patients with cardio­
genic shock, there is currently insufficient evidence 
to support the use of any particular agent in this con­
text9,95,96. Dobutamine is generally the first­line inotrope 
of choice in the clinic9,95,96. The detrimental effects of 
positive inotropic agents have been extensively described 
in the literature97,98, and their use should, therefore, be 
restricted to the shortest possible duration and the low­
est dose, both individualized to the patient. Although 
little guidance exists on how inotrope treatment should 
be individualized, echocardiography might be helpful in 
certain scenarios.
First, not all patients with cardiac disease respond 
to escalating doses of dobutamine by increasing their 
stroke volume; in some patients, dobutamine can result 
in an increase in the total isovolumic time (tIVT)99. 
Echocardiographic identification of an abnormally 
prolonged tIVT with dobutamine use, or an increase in 
tIVT in response to escalating inotropic support might 
indicate that inotropes are directly impairing myo­
cardial performance, thereby prompting a reduction 
in dose or a change in treatment strategy99–101 (FIG. 5). 
Second, the combination of LV end­diastolic pressure 
(LVEDP) and low aortic root pressure might result in a 
mismatch of coronary perfusion and myocardial oxygen 
demand. If untreated, this mismatch can result in type 2 
myocardial infarction102 (FIG. 3d). Echocardiographic 
demonstration of a dominant or isolated A wave on 
transmitral Doppler in combin 
ation with post 
ejection 
shortening can also be diagnostic (FIG. 6a,b), and indi­
cates that aortic root pressure should be increased 
and/or LVEDP reduced103,104. Third, physio 
logical 
studies have demonstrated that the combin 
ation of 
RV ischaemia and increased RV afterload is particu­
larly injurious to RV performance, resulting in a fall in 
systemic blood pressure and cardiac output levels105. 
Echocardiography can be used to estimate pulmo­
nary artery systolic pressure and pulmonary vascular 
resistance, as well as measure RV dimensions and per­
formance106. Echocardiographic identification of high 
pulmonary vascular resistance with or without pulmo­
nary hypertension in combination with RV dysfunction 
in cardiogenic shock might necessitate the introduction 
of a pressor agent plus treatment to reduce RV after­
load90,107 (FIG. 6c,d). Finally, in a patient with falling car­
diac output levels despite escalating inotropic support, 
echocardiography can help to diagnose LV outflow tract 
obstruction (with or without associated mitral regurgi­
tation)27,108. Treatment in this context involves reduction 
or cessation of positive inotropic agents, in combination 
with volume and pressor support.
Cardiac arrest. The most extreme presentation of cardio­
genic shock is cardiac arrest. International evidence­ 
 
based guidelines recommend the use of echo 
cardio­
graphy to diagnose or exclude some of the causes of 
arrest109. However, echocardiography should not affect 
the delivery of high­quality cardiopulmonary resuscita­
tion, and specific training in advanced cardiovascular 
life support is required, even for experienced practition­
ers. As images are obtained and recorded only dur­
ing the pulse/rhythm check, studies performed during 
cardiac arrest are strictly time­limited, and therefore 
are dissimilar to comprehensive studies that use only 
focused 2D imaging aimed at diagnosis or exclusion of 
potentially reversible causes in a simple, binary manner. 
The pathology leading to arrest is likely to be extreme 
(tamponade, massive pulmonary embolism, severe 
LV and/or RV dysfunction, myocardial infarction/
ischaemia, hypovolaemia, or tension pneumo 
thorax) 
and fairly easy to diagnose without more sophisti­
cated echocardio 
graphic techniques. Whether the use 
of echo 
cardiography in cardiac arrest (and as part of 
care after resuscitation) can improve outcomes is 
unknown, but its application in the prehospital setting 
has been found to change management strategies in up 
to 60% of patients110,111.

leaflet (white arrow) with associated torrential mitral regurgitation. The increase in left 
ventricular afterload from ECMO has resulted in failure of the left ventricle (LV) to eject, 
with a persistently closed aortic valve (AV; red arrow) and stasis of blood in the aortic 
root. d | Reversal of systolic pulmonary venous flow (arrows) in a patient receiving

 Acute mechanical circulatory support. The  
indications 
for mechanical circulatory support (MCS) in the acute 
setting are constantly changing112,113. Intra­aortic  
balloon 
pumps are no longer routinely recommended for cardio­
genic shock114. A range of new percutaneous ventricular 
assist devices are available, in addition to extra 
corporeal 
membrane oxygenation (ECMO). These techniques can 
be used as a bridge to recovery or for longer­term support, 
and differ not only in terms of their technical aspects, 
but the degree and type of support provided (LV and/or 
RV support, with or without the addition of respir 
atory 
support)115–120. Echocardiography is critical for successful 
implementation of acute MCS121,122 (TABLE 2). MCS is not 
a treatment per se, but instead a support 
ive therapy for 
patients awaiting treatment or resolution of the under­
lying pathological process. As in all cases of AHF, the 
most important role of echo 
cardiography is to diagnose 
the underlying cardiac cause. When the decision to 
institute MCS is made, echocardio 
graphy is then used 
to corroborate the decision regarding the type and level 
of support required. Although clear echocardio 
graphy 
parameters have been used to guide longer­term MCS 
for both the left and right heart123,124, these parameters 
are not yet available for devices designed for short­term 
use. Furthermore, clear contraindications to MCS exist 
that can be diagnosed only using echocardiography. 
Echocardiography is used in the initiation of MCS, 
including the use of vascular ultrasonography to guide 
safe vessel cannulation and steer device or cannula 
placement. Echocardiography is subsequently used to 
monitor MCS by ensuring the goals of support are met, 
and for detecting complications and assessing tolerance 
to assistance121. Unfortunately, peripheral ECMO can 
paradoxically worsen cardiac function by increasing 
LV afterload. Although a  
number of echocardiographic 
parameters exist that might indicate this complica­
tion (including lack of aortic valve opening, biphasic 
retro 
grade flow across the mitral valve in diastole, and 
retro 
grade systolic pulmo 
nary venous flow; FIG. 7), the 
inherent limitations of echocardio 
graphy in estimating 
LAP and LVEDP,  
especially when the heart is partially 
bypassed, makes this strategy particu 
larly challenging122. 
Echocardiography can be used, however, to guide inter­
ventions to ensure that the heart is adequately offloaded.

 Finally, a number of echocardiographic parameters 
are used in conjunction with clinical and haemo­
dynamic assessment to predict which patients might be 
 
successfully weaned off MCS125,126.
Other indications
Transoesophageal echocardiograpy can also be used in 
the acute setting in patients with dynamic mitral regurgi­
tation (see Supplementary information S4 (figure)). 
Furthermore, features of infective endocarditis caused by 
aortic prostheses or a device can be demonstrated using 
transoesophageal echocardiography (see Supplementary 
information S5 (figure)). 
Quality assurance
A detailed overview of the necessary organizational 
structure and processes for use of ultrasonography 
and echocardiography in the acute setting is beyond 
the scope of this Review, and has been published pre­
viously26,127–130. However, when used in routine clinical 
care, training, education, protocols, and ongoing certifi­
cation of practitioners are required, which should all be 
performed within existing governance structures.
Conclusions
Echocardiography and LUS can assist in the rapid assess­
ment of patients with acute dyspnoea and hypotension, 
and have the potential to transform the way in which 
clinicians assess and manage critically ill patients with 
AHF and cardiogenic shock (TABLE 3). The current AHF 
guidelines are cautious in recommendations for the 
widespread use of advanced echocardiography tech­
niques in the acute care setting because robust applica­
bility data are lacking, interpretation of findings requires 
highly specialized, in­depth knowledge of cardiac patho­
physiology, and there is potential for harm by injudicious 
application in this patient population. The opportuni­
ties to improve diagnostic accuracy, reduce delays in 
treatment, and improve outcomes through the use of 
advanced echocardiography need to be further explored.
