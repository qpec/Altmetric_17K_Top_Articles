Abstract
Background: Transportation by motorcycle and bicycle has become popular in Taiwan, this study was designed
to investigate the protective effect of helmet use during motorcycle and bicycle accidents by using a propensity
score–matched study based on trauma registry system data.
Methods: Data of adult patients hospitalized for motorcycle or bicycle accidents between January 1, 2009 and
December 31, 2015 were retrieved from the Trauma Registry System. These included 7735 motorcyclists with
helmet use, 863 motorcyclists without helmet use, 76 bicyclists with helmet use, and 647 bicyclists without helmet
use. The primary outcome measurement was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were the hospital length of
stay (LOS), intensive care unit (ICU) admission rate, and ICU LOS. Normally distributed continuous data were
analyzed by the unpaired Student t-test, and non-normally distributed data were compared using the Mann–
Whitney U-test. Two-sided Fisher exact or Pearson chi-square tests were used to compare categorical data.
Propensity score matching (1:1 ratio using optimal method with a 0.2 caliper width) was performed using NCSS
software, adjusting for the following covariates: sex, age, and comorbidities. Further logistic regression was used to
evaluate the effect of helmet use on mortality rates of motorcyclists and bicyclists, respectively.
Results: The mortality rate for motorcyclists with helmet use (1.1%) was significantly lower than for motorcyclists
without helmet use (4.2%; odds ratio [OR] 0.2; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.17–0.37; p < 0.001). Among bicyclists,
there was no significant difference in mortality rates between the patients with helmet use (5.3%) and those without
helmet use (3.7%; OR 1.4; 95% CI: 0.49–4.27; p = 0.524). After propensity-score matching for covariates, including sex,
age, and comorbidities, 856 well-balanced pairs of motorcyclists and 76 pairs of bicyclists were identified for outcome
comparison, showing that helmet use among motorcyclists was associated with lower mortality rates (OR 0.2; 95% CI:
0.09–0.44; p < 0.001). In contrast, helmet use among bicyclists was not associated with a decrease in mortality (OR 1.3;
95% CI: 0.30–5.96; p = 0.706). The hospital LOS was also significantly shorter for motorcyclists with helmet use than for
those without (9.5 days vs. 12.0 days, respectively, p < 0.001) although for bicyclists, helmet use was not associated
with hospital LOS. Fewer motorcyclists with helmet use were admitted to the ICU, regardless of the severity of injury;
however, no significant difference of ICU admission rates was found between bicyclists with and without helmets.

Conclusions: Motorcycle helmets provide protection to adult motorcyclists involved in traffic accidents and their use is
associated with a decrease in mortality rates and the risk of head injuries. However, no such protective effect of helmet
use was observed for bicyclists involved in collisions.

Background
Traveling by motorcycle has been a common part of
daily living for years and remains a crucial mode of
transportation in Taiwan, due to the country’s suitable
climate and high population density [1, 2]. According to
a published study in Taiwan, 3323 persons were killed by
traffic accidents in 2011, and more than 60 % of whom
were motorcycle riders or passengers [2]. Bicycling has
also become popular in Taiwan, not only as a means of
transportation, but also as a symbol of personal fitness.
In the United States, national statistics report that
500,000 people sustain bicycle-related injuries per year,
resulting in approximately 800 deaths [3]. It is estimated
that for every 2 million trips, 600 injuries will occur and
one bicyclist will die in a collision [4]. In Taiwan, a retro-
spective cohort study revealed that bicyclists had a 1.2-
fold higher adjusted odds ratio (AOR) of in-hospital
mortality than motorcyclists [5]. Among patients with
injury severity score (ISS) ≥25, bicyclists had a 4.4 times
increased odds of mortality compared to motorcyclists
(95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.95–9.82) [5].
Although the protective effect of motorcycle helmets
is already well-established in the literature [6–14], head
injury is still regarded as a critical cause of mortality
among victims of motorcycle collisions. Head injury is
also the main cause of hospitalization of bicycle-related
injuries [15]. Data from an estimate in 2000 noted that
approximately $8 billion is spent annually in the United
States in the care of bicycle crash victims, which is a sig-
nificant cost from a public health perspective [16]. Head
injuries often occur in motorcycle and bicycle traffic ac-
cidents and have severe consequences [17, 18], however,
the current laws in Taiwan only enforce the use of hel-
mets on motorcyclists, while helmet use remains op-
tional for bicyclists. As a result, helmet use is more
common among motorcycle riders than bicycle riders.
Furthermore, most bicycle helmets are smaller, thinner,
and lighter, than motorcycle helmets, thus they may pro-
vide less protection to riders during collisions. Moreover,
because of different riding speeds, the impact energy
may differ between collisions involving motorcyclists
and those involving bicyclists. There is scarce informa-
tion on the protective effect of helmet use in Taiwan,
where motorcycle and bicycle accidents occur on rela-
tively crowded streets [19]. Therefore, in this study we
aimed to investigate the protective effect of helmet use
during motorcycle and bicycle accidents by using a pro-
pensity score–matched study based on trauma registry
system data over a seven-year period.
Methods
This study was approved by the institutional review board
(IRB) of the Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital
(reference number 201600005B0), a Level I regional
trauma center providing care to trauma patients, primarily
from southern Taiwan. We designed a retrospective study
to review the data of all adult motorcyclists and bicyclists
(n = 9321) entered into the Trauma Registry System be-
tween January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2015 (Fig. 1). Pa-
tients who had sustained an injury other than motorcycle
or bicycle accident or whose registered data were incom-
plete were excluded. Detailed patient information was re-
trieved
from
the
Trauma
Registry
System
of
our
institution, including the following variables: age; sex;
body mass index (BMI); co-morbidities, such as diabetes
mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), coronary artery dis-
ease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), cerebral vas-
cular accident (CVA), and end-stage renal disease (ESRD);
vital signs on arrival; blood alcohol concentration (BAC)
on arrival; Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score; Abbreviated
Injury Scale (AIS); and ISS on arrival; length of stay (LOS)
in the hospital and intensive care unit (ICU); in-hospital
mortality; procedures performed in the emergency depart-
ment (ED); and associated head and maxillofacial trauma.
In order to evaluate the relationship between helmet
use and traffic accident injury severity and outcome, the
data of patients presenting to the ED following motor-
cycle and bicycle traffic accidents were analyzed. Motor-
cyclists with helmet use (n = 7735) were compared with
motorcyclists without helmet use (n = 863), and bicy-
clists with helmet use (n = 76) were compared with bicy-
clists without helmet use (n = 647) using the SPSS v.20
statistical software (IBM, Armonk, NY). The primary
outcome of the study was in-hospital mortality, and the
secondary outcomes were hospital LOS, ICU admission
rate, and ICU LOS. For categorical variables, Chi-square
tests were used to determine the significance of the asso-
ciations between the predictor and outcome variables.
For continuous variables, Student t-tests were applied to
analyze normally distributed continuous data, while
Mann-Whitney U tests were used to compare non-
normally distributed data. Univariate logistic regression

 analyses were performed to identify the significant pre-
dictor variables of the mortality risk. The corresponding
crude odds ratio (OR) with 95% CI for each variable was
calculated. Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r) was used
for bivariate correlation to analyze the relationships be-
tween items of co-morbidity, including DM, HTN, CAD,
CHF, CVA, and ESRD. Thereafter, to minimize the con-
founding effects due to a nonrandomized assignment in
the evaluation of the effect of helmet use on mortality,
propensity scores were calculated using SPSS v.20 statis-
tical software with helmet use as dependent variable and
the following covariates as independent variables: sex;
age; and comorbidities (Additional file 1: Table S1).
Using NCSS software (NCSS 10; NCSS Statistical soft-
ware, Kaysville, Utah), the optimal method was used to
create 1:1 matched study groups with a 0.2 caliper width.
After adjusting for these confounding factors, binary lo-
gistic regression was used to evaluate the interventional
factor of helmet use by motorcyclists and bicyclists on
mortality. All results are presented as the mean ± stand-
ard deviation. A p-value <0.05 was considered statisti-
cally significant.
Results
Demographics and injury characteristics of patients
The mean age of subjects was 46.0 ± 17.5 years,
48.8 ± 18.6 years, 48.8 ± 13.7 years, and 63.1 ± 15.6 years
for motorcyclists with helmet use, motorcyclists without
helmet use, bicyclists with helmet use, and bicyclists with-
out helmet use, respectively. The BMI distribution was
comparable between motorcyclists with and without hel-
met use, but in the bicyclist group, significantly more
patients had helmets in the overweighted subgroup (35.5%
vs. 22.7%, OR: 1.9 [95% CI: 1.13–3.10], p = 0.013). Fewer
motorcyclists with helmet use had HTN compared to mo-
torcyclists without helmet use. Fewer bicyclists with hel-
met use had DM and HTN compared with bicyclists
without helmet use. Among motorcyclists, significantly
fewer patients with helmet use had a BAC level of
>50 mg/dl compared to motorcyclists without helmet use
(7.1% vs. 24.0%, OR: 0.2 [95% CI: 0.20–0.29], p < 0.001).
For bicyclists, there was no difference in terms of BAC
level between those with helmets and without helmets
(2.6% vs. 5.4%, OR: 0.5 [95% CI: 0.11–2.01], p = 0.414).
Covariates and outcome of the patients
The covariates and outcome of adult traffic accident hel-
met users and nonusers before and after propensity score
matching were summarized in Table 1 (motorcyclists) and
Table 2 (bicyclists). After propensity score matching, the
difference of age, gender, and comorbidities, which in-
cluded DM, HTN, CAD, CHF, CVA, and ESRD, between
the helmet users and non-users was adjusted.
For the motorcyclist group before matching (Table 1),
the average GCS score was significantly higher for pa-
tients with helmet use. Significantly fewer motorcyclists
with helmet use had a GCS score ≤ 12 upon arrival to
the ED and a significantly greater number had a GCS
score ≥ 13 compared with motorcyclists without helmet
use. Fewer patients with helmet use had an AIS ≥3 over
the head/neck, face, thorax, and extremities, compared
with patients without helmet use. A lower median ISS (8
[4–10] vs. 10 [5–18], p < 0.001) was also observed in
motorcyclists with helmet use and significantly fewer

 patients were severely injured (ISS between 16 and 24
and ≥25) compared with patients without helmet use.
The hospital LOS was also significantly shorter for mo-
torcyclists with helmet use than for those without hel-
met use (9.5 days vs. 12.0 days, respectively, p < 0.001),
and significantly fewer patients with helmet use were
admitted to the ICU. No significant difference of the
ICU LOS was found. The mortality rate for motorcy-
clists with helmet use was significantly lower than for
motorcyclists without helmet use (1.1% vs. 4.2%, OR: 0.2
[95% CI: 0.17–0.37], p < 0.001). After propensity score
matching, the outcomes were generally comparable with

 bicyclists with helmet use than for those without helmet
use. However, the distribution of ISS according to the
stratification of ISS (<16, 16–24, ≥25) showed no signifi-
cant difference between the helmet users and non-users.
The hospital LOS and ICU LOS were not significantly
different between bicyclists with or without helmet use,
but fewer bicyclists with helmet use were admitted to
the ICU. There was no significant difference in mortality
rates among bicyclists, with or without helmet use (5.3%
vs. 3.7%, OR: 1.4 [95% CI: 0.49–4.27], p = 0.524). After
propensity score matching, there was no significant dif-
ference in terms of the GCS, AIS ≥ 3, and the ISS among
bicyclists with or without helmet use. The hospital LOS
and ICU LOS were also comparable between the two
groups. Still, helmet use in bicyclists was not signifi-
cantly associated with mortality in this study, although
the odds of mortality in bicyclists with helmet use was
1.3 times that of bicyclists without helmet use (OR: 1.3
[95% CI: 0.30–5.96], p = 0.706).
Associated injuries at ED
Physiological parameters and life-saving procedures, includ-
ing cardiopulmonary resuscitation, intubation, chest tube
insertion, and blood transfusion performed in the ED are
summarized in Table 3 (motorcyclists) and Table 4 (bicy-
clists). In the motorcyclists group, helmet use was associ-
ated with a decreased number of patients with a heart
rate > 100 beat/min and a respiratory rate < 10/min or
>29/min, and significantly lower intubation rates. After pro-
pensity score matching, we only found a significantly lower
intubation rate for motorcyclists with helmet use. For bicy-
clists, helmet use was not associated with a significantly im-
proved physiological response or with fewer life-saving
procedures before or after propensity score matching.
Regarding the associated injuries in the head and face re-
gion, significantly fewer motorcyclists with helmet use suf-
fered head and maxillofacial trauma, including neurological
deficit, cranial fracture, epidural hematoma (EDH), subdural
hematoma (SDH), subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), intra-
cerebral hemorrhage (ICH), cerebral contusion, cervical ver-
tebra fracture,
nasal fracture,
maxillary fracture, and
mandibular fracture were found than those motorcyclists
without helmet use before propensity score matching (Table
5). However, this protective effect of helmets was not ob-
served in the bicyclists group, except there was a reduced
risk of developing SDH among bicyclists with helmet use
than those without (2.6% vs. 13.2%, OR: 0.2 [95% CI: 0.04–
0.84], p = 0.031) (Table 6). After propensity score matching,
the same protective effect of helmets could still be observed
in the motorcycle group, but not in the bicycle group.
Discussion
The results of this study highlight the protective effect of
motorcycle helmets, with a significantly lower mortality
rate among motorcyclists with helmet use than among
motorcyclists without helmet use. The well-balanced pro-
pensity score-matched model, which eliminated the con-
founding effects of sex, age, and comorbidities, further
strengthened our conclusion on the protective effect of
motorcycle helmets. Furthermore, motorcycle helmet
users also had higher GCS scores and a lower ISS scores
on presentation, shorter hospital LOS, and lower ICU ad-
mission rates. The protective effect of bicycle helmets was
not demonstrated in the bicyclists group, despite the use
of propensity score-matched populations of bicyclists.
The protective effect of motorcycle helmets is well
established in the literature [6–14]. Helmet use among
motorcyclists was found to benefit both riders and soci-
ety, with improved discharge outcomes, as well as a re-
duction in mortality rates, traumatic brain injuries, and
costs of hospitalization [6–14]. Hooten et al. concluded
that motorcycle helmets significantly decrease overall
mortality, improve outcome at discharge, and are cost-
effective, resulting in healthcare savings [6]. A systemic

 review published in 2008 by Liu et al. also concluded
that motorcycle helmets reduce the risk of death and
head injury among motorcycle riders involved in colli-
sions [7]. Another retrospective study conducted by
Sosin et al., found that motorcycle helmets not only re-
duce the severity of nonfatal head injuries, but also
lower the rate of fatal injuries [8]. The legal enforcement
of helmet use for motorcycle riders is therefore of cru-
cial importance. Kraus et al. found that the enactment of
motorcycle helmet law in California of USA significantly
reduces the fatality rate in motorcycle accidents, as well
as the number and severity of head injuries [9]. More-
over, Hotz et al. reported a significantly increased num-
ber and severity of brain injuries following the repeal of
a motorcycle helmet law [10]. The data on cervical spine
protection is controversial, with some studies reporting
that the use of motorcycle helmets may increase the rate
of cervical spine injury [20, 21], and others reporting sta-
tistically similar, or even lower risks of cervical spine in-
jury [22–26]. In this study, although the neurological
damage from cervical spine injury was not evaluated,
motorcycle helmet use was associated with a signifi-
cantly lower rate of cervical vertebra fractures.
The protective effect of bicycle helmets has been re-
ported in the literature. Heng et al. found that helmet
use was associated with fewer injuries to the head and
face, as well as a lower ISS, in bicycle crashes [15]. In
two case-control studies published by Thompson et al.,
bicycle helmet use was associated with a decreased risk
of head injuries among injured bicyclists [27, 28]. A
case-control study also reported a 74% reduced risk of
head injury among bicyclists with helmet use involved in

 accidents with motor vehicles [29]. Another recent study
of 13,500 bicyclist injuries in France, conducted by
Amoros et al., found a lower risk of all head injuries
among bicyclists with helmet use, in both urban and
rural environments [30]. However, Sethi et al. studied in-
jured bicyclists in a level I regional trauma center and
found no significant difference in mortality rates be-
tween patients with and those without helmet use [3]. In
this study, we only observed a reduced risk of developing
SDH among bicyclists with helmet use compared to
those without after propensity score matching, while the
mortality rate and the risks of all the other associated
head injuries, other than SDH, were not significantly re-
duced. Therefore, unlike helmet use among motorcy-
clists,
protective
effect
of
helmet
use
in
lowering
mortality rates could not be identified among bicyclists.
A number of reasons for the lack of a protective effect
of bicycle helmets in lowering mortality rates and rates
of a range of head injuries in this study were identified.
Firstly, the design and material of bicycle helmets are
significantly different to those of motorcycle helmets,
thus less protection could be expected. Secondly, it is
reasonable to postulate that the distinct contusion force
and trauma mechanism of bicycle traffic accidents can
result in differences in the severity and presentation of
intracranial hemorrhage between traffic accidents involv-
ing bicyclists and those involving motorcyclists. There-
fore, the protective effect of bicycle helmets against
death and different types of head injuries could not be
demonstrated in relatively minor crashes. Thirdly, the
sample size of bicyclists in our study may not be suffi-
ciently large to generate a significant difference in mor-
tality rates and rates of head injuries between bicyclists
with and without helmet use. Further studies involving a
larger series or involving a controlled crash scenario
may provide more robust evidence of a protective effect
of bicycle helmets.
A specific strength of our study was the propensity
score-matching model, which markedly reduced bias on
mortality. However, the results after matching depended
on the specification of the logistic regression model and
the potential confounders measured in this study. There-
fore, balance between the comparison groups regarding
unmeasured confounders could not be fully guaranteed.
This study also presented a number of limitations. First,
the inherent bias of retrospective studies must be con-
sidered. Second, the lack of available data regarding the
circumstances of the crash, the mechanism of injury, the
number of riders and their status of helmet-wearing on
the same motorcycle or bike, the speed of the motor-
cycle or bike, and the type of helmet used, could also
lead to a bias. Third, injured patients who were dis-
charged against advice from the ED, those who were not
brought to a level I trauma center after the crash, on-
site deaths, those who were discharged but got re-
admitted into hospital not via the ED, and those who
were discharged but died from a complication directly
related to the trauma, were not included in this study.
This may represent a sample bias in the assessment of
mortality. Notably, because there were more on-site
deaths in motorcycle crashes than in bicycle crashes in
our hospital, the extent of difference in terms of mortal-
ity in this study would be expected to be greater in the
motorcyclists compared with that in the bicyclists. In
addition, other important data, such as surgical outcome
and complications, were not evaluated in this study.

 Finally, the study population, limited to a single urban
trauma center in southern Taiwan, may not be represen-
tative of other populations.
Conclusion
This study, conducted at a Level I trauma center, revealed
that motorcycle helmets provide protection to adult
motorcyclists involved in traffic accidents and their use is
associated with a decrease in mortality rates and the risk
of different head injuries. Motorcycle helmet users also had
a higher GCS score and a lower ISS score, a shorter hos-
pital LOS, and a lower ICU admission rate. In contrast, for
bicyclists, helmet use was not associated with a decrease in
mortality rates and the risk of different head injuries other
than SDH. This study therefore did not identify any pro-
tective effect of bicycle helmets for adult bicyclists involved
in traffic accidents in Taiwan to keep them away from the
risk of different head injuries and mortality.
