Steviol glycosides (SGs), such as stevioside and rebaudioside A, are natural, non-caloric
sweet-tasting organic molecules, present in extracts of the scrub plant Stevia rebaudiana,
which are widely used as sweeteners in consumer foods and beverages. TRPM5 is a Ca2 þ-
activated cation channel expressed in type II taste receptor cells and pancreatic b-cells. Here
we show that stevioside, rebaudioside A and their aglycon steviol potentiate the activity of
TRPM5. We find that SGs potentiate perception of bitter, sweet and umami taste, and
enhance glucose-induced insulin secretion in a Trpm5-dependent manner. Daily consumption
of stevioside prevents development of high-fat-diet-induced diabetic hyperglycaemia in wild-
type mice, but not in Trpm5 � / � mice. These results elucidate a molecular mechanism of
action of SGs and identify TRPM5 as a potential target to prevent and treat type 2 diabetes.

 S
teviol glycosides (SGs) are found in the leaves of a scrub
plant native to the subtropical regions of South America,
Stevia rebaudiana Bertoni sp. Stevia extract has been
used for centuries as a sweetening food additive in South
America1, and was recently approved for this purpose also in the
European Union and the United States. These molecules have
a common aglycone core structure steviol (ent-13-hydroxykaur-
16-en-18-oic acid), and differ in their glycosylation pattern. The
two major glycosides found in the leaves are stevioside and
rebaudioside A2. Both taste B200–300 times sweeter than
sucrose. Non-caloric sweeteners are increasingly introduced
into common foods such as diet sodas, cereals and desserts,
as sugar replacement, and are for this reason recommended
for weight loss and for individuals suffering from glucose
intolerance
and
diabetes3.
However,
stevia
extracts
might
have
direct
insulinotropic
and
anti-hyperglycaemic
effects
in type 2 diabetic animal models4. Mechanistic insight into
the biological and health effects of Stevia extract and SGs is
lacking.
Taste perception in type II taste receptor cells relies on
the activity of transient receptor potential cation channel
subfamily melastatin member 5 (TRPM5), a monovalent cation
channel, activated by a rise in intracellular calcium5. In short,
type II taste receptor cells detect sweet, bitter and umami tastants
on the tongue. Taste specificity of the cell is accomplished
by expression of a specific G-protein-coupled receptor. Sweet,
bitter and umami taste receptors have a common downstream
signal transduction cascade, which consists of the activation
of
phospholipase
C,
release
of
Ca2 þ
from
IP3-sensitive
Ca2 þ stores and activation of TRPM5 (ref. 6). TRPM5 activity
depolarizes the cell, which triggers the voltage-gated channel
calcium homeostasis modulator 1 that mediates the release
of ATP neurotransmitter, which in turn activates afferent
signalling to the brain7. TRPM5 is also present in insulin-
producing
b-cells
in
the
pancreas
and
in
peripheral
enteroendocrine cells in the gut5,8–12. We showed recently
that TRPM5 determines the frequency of glucose-induced
calcium oscillations of insulin-releasing pancreatic b-cells10.
Consistent with the cellular expression and action of TRPM5,
the systemic phenotype of Trpm5-deficient mice includes loss
of
sweet,
bitter
and
umami
taste
responsiveness13,
and
decreased glucose tolerance due to impaired glucose-induced
insulin release10,14. It is also interesting to note that Trpm5
expression in the small intestine from diabetic patients is
negatively
correlated
with
blood
glucose
concentrations15.
Likewise, WFS-1 diabetic pancreatic islets show a reduced
Trpm5 expression16. Moreover, TRPM5 variants are associated
with a prediabetic phenotype in humans. TRPM5 single-
nucleotide polymorphisms occurred more often in patients with
disturbed insulin secretion, elevated plasma glucose, lower
glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) levels and decreased insulin
sensitivity17. Specific TRPM5 polymorphisms showed increased
prevalence in patients with obesity-related metabolic syndrome18.
On the basis of these observations, the hypothesis was developed
that
TRPM5
might
be
a
pharmacological
target
for
the
development of a novel type of insulin secretagogue19–21.
However, since pharmacology for TRPM5 is currently limited
to fairly non-selective-blocking agents, this hypothesis remained
untested22–25.
Our current results indicate that SGs potentiate TRPM5 ion
channel activity. In this way, they potentiate the glucose-induced
insulin secretion (GIIS) from pancreatic islets and enhance
peripheral taste responsiveness in type II taste receptor cells.
Chronic stevioside consumption effectively prevents development
of high-fat-diet (HFD)-induced diabetes in mice, in a TRPM5-
dependent manner.
Results
Steviol and its glycosides potentiate TRPM5. To test whether
SGs
affect
TRPM5-mediated signal
transduction pathways,
TRPM5 currents were measured in HEK293T cells using the
whole-cell patch-clamp technique. TRPM5 currents are readily
activated upon break-in with 1 mM free Ca2 þ in the pipette
solution and inactivate quickly with a variable time course25.
Instead,
when
cells
were
perfused
with
stevioside
during
the inactivating phase, a strong increase of the inward and
outward current was observed, which disappeared upon washout
(Fig. 1a–d). With strongly buffered [Ca2 þ]int, stevioside does
not activate TRPM5 (Fig. 1d). Similar results were obtained
with rebaudioside A, another SG that differs from stevioside
by one additional glycosylation (Fig. 1e–h). We also tested
steviol, the chemical core group of steviol compounds and the
circulating metabolite in blood plasma after oral consumption
of SGs1 (Fig. 1i). As shown in Fig. 1j–l, steviol yielded similar
results compared to its glycosylated derivatives, indicating
that the steviol group is sufficient for the interaction between
SGs and TRPM5.
In cell-free inside-out patches, TRPM5 can be activated by
direct application of Ca2 þ to the intracellular side of the
membrane25. In this setting, TRPM5 currents quickly and
irreversibly inactivate25. Stevioside and steviol delay inactivation
of Ca2 þ-activated TRPM5 currents, both when applied on the
intra- and extracellular side of the membrane (Supplementary
Fig. 1). These data strongly indicate that steviol interacts
directly with the TRPM5 protein.
We have shown before that TRPM5 is weakly voltage-
dependent25,26. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 2a,b, stevioside
induces a shift of the voltage-dependent activation of TRPM5
towards more negative membrane potentials. The voltage for
half maximal activation (V1/2) shifted from þ 145.9±33.9 to
þ 42.8±30.6 mV in the presence of stevioside (P ¼ 5.1 � 10 � 4,
n ¼ 8, paired t-test, Supplementary Fig. 2c). Finally, stevioside has
no effect on untransfected cells (Supplementary Fig. 2d,e), and
stevioside and steviol have no effect on cells expressing TRPM4
and other, more distantly related, TRP channels (TRPA1, TRPV1,
TRPM3 and TRPM8; Supplementary Fig. 2f–h).
Stevioside increases action potential frequency in b-cells. In
pancreatic b-cells, TRPM5 mediates a depolarizing current,
which tunes [Ca2 þ]int and Vm oscillation frequency after
glucose stimulation10. Consistent with this, a glucose-induced
cation current is potentiated by stevioside in pancreatic b-cells.
This current shares some properties of TRPM5, including an
outwardly rectifying I–V relation and a reversal potential around
0 mV (Fig. 2a,b). We analysed the effects of stevioside on the
frequency of action potential firing, stimulated by high glucose
(20 mM) or tolbutamide (100 mM). Stevioside increased the
frequency of action potentials in wild-type (WT) b-cells, as
demonstrated by a reduction in the number of longer intervals
between action potentials (Wilcoxon sign-rank test, Fig. 2c,d,
n ¼ 5 cells each). In contrast, in Trpm5 � / � b-cells, the frequency
of
(tolbutamide-induced)
action
potential
firing
was
not
significantly affected by stevioside (Fig. 2e).
Steviol and stevioside increase calcium activity in islets. When
stimulated with 10 mM glucose, pancreatic islets respond with
oscillations of [Ca2 þ]int (Fig. 3). Application of stevioside
resulted in a dose-dependent increase of the frequency of glucose-
induced Ca2 þ oscillations in WT islets, but not in Trpm5 � / �
islets (Fig. 3a–f). Stevioside exerts this effect with an effector
concentration for half-maximum response of 690 nM. Similar
results were obtained with steviol (Fig. 3h–j). Note that stevioside

 did not induce any changes in [Ca2 þ]int in low-glucose condi-
tions (3 mM; Supplementary Fig. 3a). The frequency of glucose-
induced Ca2 þ oscillations is stable for up to 1 h in the continuous
presence of glucose (Supplementary Fig. 3b,c). From these
experiments it can be also derived that the size of pancreatic islets,
reflecting the b-cell mass, is not statistically different between
WT and Trpm5 � / � mice (Fig. 3d,e,g).
Using Fourier analysis, the effect of steviol and stevioside on
WT islets can be clearly distinguished from the effect on Trpm5� /�
islets (Supplementary Fig. 3g–k). The Fourier-transformed (FT)
frequency
spectrum
from
WT
islets
highlights
a
shift
of
the frequency count towards higher frequencies, in response to
stevioside unlike in Trpm5� /� islets (Kolmogorov–Smirnov test,
P¼ 2.96� 10-4, Supplementary Fig. 3g). Allocation of the islets
to slow-, fast- or mixed-oscillating populations (as described in
ref. 10) resulted in a significant increase of the proportion of fast-
oscillating islets in the presence of stevioside (Fisher’s exact test,
P¼ 0.009, Supplementary Fig. 3h) or steviol (Supplementary Fig. 3i).
In the Trpm5� /� mice, stevioside or steviol did not change
the proportion of fast-oscillating islets (Fisher’s exact test, P¼ 0.16,
Supplementary
Fig.
3g,j,k).
These
findings
demonstrate
that
SGs increase the frequency of glucose-induced calcium oscillations
in pancreatic islets in a TRPM5-dependent manner.
When ingested by humans or mice, stevioside is metabolized in
the intestine to its aglycon steviol. Once taken up in the blood,
steviol circulates in the blood plasma and is finally metabolized by

 the liver to steviol glucuronide, which is excreted via the urine27.
To increase the physiological relevance of our results, we
measured the concentration of free steviol circulating in the
plasma of mice that received 100 mg l � 1 (124 mM) stevioside in
their drinking water for 2 weeks. Circulating plasma steviol levels
amounted
to
391±58.6 nM
in
these
animals
(Fig.
3k)28.
Application of this physiological concentration of steviol evoked
a significant increase of glucose-induced calcium oscillation
frequency, similar to stevioside (Fig. 3l,m).
It has been suggested previously that stevioside activates the
sweet
taste
receptor,
TAS1R2,TAS1R3
(refs
29,30).
Since
pancreatic b-cells functionally express these receptors31, we
tested the effect of stevioside in sweet receptor knockout mice
(Tas1r2,Tas1r3( � / � )2).

 obtained compared to WT islets upon perfusion with stevioside
or steviol (Supplementary Fig. 3d–f), that is, a significant increase
( þ 29%) in the glucose-induced Ca2 þ oscillation frequency
(Supplementary Fig. 3f) such as WT islets ( þ 31%, Fig. 3c). As
in WT islets, the distribution of dominant oscillation frequencies
of the islets from Tas1r2,Tas1r3( � / � )2 mice was significantly
shifted towards faster frequencies in the presence of stevioside
(P ¼ 1.07 � 10 � 8, Supplementary Fig. 3g, blue). Subdivision
of the islets in slow, mixed or fast islets showed that the fast
sub-population appears or increases in the presence of stevioside
or steviol (Supplementary Fig. 3l,m).
TRPM5 was previously shown to play a role in GLP-1-
mediated insulin secretion32. The observed effects of stevioside
are however independent from GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R)-
mediated signalling. Stevioside has an additive potentiating
effect on the GLP-1 potentiated calcium oscillation frequency
(Supplementary Fig. 4a,d). As anticipated from Shigeto et al.32,
the GLP-1 potentiation of glucose-induced calcium oscillations
was significantly lower in Trpm5 � / � islets, and no additional
stevioside-mediated potentiation was observed (Supplementary
Fig. 4b,e). The GLP-1R antagonist exendin-3 (100 nM) inhibited
the
GLP-1-mediated
increase
in
glucose-induced
calcium
oscillations in WT mice, but did not interfere with the
stevioside-induced
potentiation
of
calcium
oscillations
(Supplementary Fig. 4c,f).
Stevioside stimulates insulin secretion in vitro and in vivo.
Considering the effect of SGs on glucose-induced Ca2 þ oscilla-
tions, and the observation that Ca2 þ
oscillation frequency
correlates with insulin release10, we aimed to test the effect of
these compounds on GIIS. As shown in Fig. 4a,b, stevioside
potentiated GIIS in WT islets, but not in Trpm5 � / � islets
(WT: P ¼ 0.001, Trpm5 � / �: P ¼ 0.35; two-sample t-test). Both in
WT and Trpm5 � / � islets, stevioside treatment was without
effect on insulin release in low-glucose conditions (3 mM).
During supraphysiological saturating conditions (30 mM KCl or
20 mM glucose), the effect of steviol supplementation on insulin
secretion was no longer apparent (Supplementary Table 1).
Also in vivo, after intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of glucose alone
or glucose plus stevioside in fasted anaesthetized mice, there
is a significantly higher plasma insulin level 30 min post injection
of stevioside in the WT mice. This effect was equally absent in
Trpm5 � / � mice (Fig. 4c).
In perifusion experiments, we analysed the effect of steviol on
the dynamics of GIIS (Fig. 4d,e; Supplementary Fig. 5). Steviol
supplementation has no effect in low glucose. The 10 mM GIIS
displays a rapid peak phase (phase 1), and a more sustained level of
insulin release (phase 2). Insulin secretion during both phases is
increased in the continuous presence of steviol (Fig. 4d,e). Secretion
was normalized to the secretion during maximal stimulation by
K30, which was not different between control and steviol perfused
conditions (control: 0.12±0.06 versus steviol: 0.15±0.04pg per
islet per minute, P ¼ 0.46; two-sample t-test). These effects were not
observed in Trpm5� / � islets (Supplementary Fig. 5a,b). Also, in
moderately high-glucose conditions (15mM), supplementation of
10mM steviol reversibly potentiated the GIIS (Supplementary
Fig. 5c,d).
Steviol and stevioside intensify taste perception. To establish
the in vivo relevance of TRPM5 modulation by SGs, we first
considered taste perception. TRPM5 is an essential component of
the intracellular signal transduction cascade elicited by sweet,
bitter and umami tastants in type II taste receptor cells6. The
two-bottle preference test is a well-established method to detect
preferences in mice33, and can be combined with lick detection
(lick-o-meter). We used this assay to assess the effect of steviol
and SGs in WT, Trpm5 � / � and Tas1r2,Tas1r3( � / � )2 mice at
various time scales. Considering that SGs are E � 300 sweeter
than sucrose (in humans), we used a concentration of 124 mM
(equimolar to 300 times o1% sucrose) for each of the SGs and
steviol. At this concentration, WT mice show a significant
preference for stevioside and rebaudioside A in a 48 h two-bottle
preference test (versus water; Fig. 5a, blue bars), which can be
attributed to the sweet taste of the SGs. Steviol, on the other hand,
does not evoke a specific preference or avoidance in WT mice
(Fig. 5a,b). However, when combined with a sweet (1% sucrose),
umami (150 mM monopotassium glutamate (MKG)) or bitter
(100 mM quinine) tastant, steviol significantly increases the
preference for sucrose and umami, and avoidance of quinine
(Fig. 5a). Importantly, the increased taste preference or avoidance
is apparent within 5 min, in a lick-o-meter test (Fig. 5b–g) and
persistent after 60 min (Supplementary Figs 6 and 7). Steviol has
no effect on the avoidance of 10 mM citric acid both in short- or
long-term exposure tests. Trpm5 � / � mice are deficient in
the signalling pathway downstream of the taste receptor.
This is reflected in the lack of preference or avoidance for
sweet, bitter or umami tastants (Fig. 5a, orange bars; Suppleme-
ntary Figs 6 and 8). Likewise, there is no preference for SGs in
Trpm5 � / � mice. Neither could we observe an increase in
peripheral taste responsiveness upon addition of steviol to the test
solution, but avoidance of citric acid was unaffected.
To test whether the taste-enhancing effect of stevioside and
steviol is dependent on the sweet taste receptor, we used
Tas1r2,Tas1r3( � / � )2 mice. It should be noted that these mice also
do not detect umami tastants, as TAS1R3 is an essential subunit of
the umami receptor13. Bitter perception is preserved in this mouse

 line. Interestingly, we found that both steviol and stevioside
increase the avoidance of quinine in Tas1r2,Tas1r3( � / � )2 mice
(Fig. 5a, green bars; Supplementary Figs 6 and 9). The avoidance
of sour taste is conserved and not changed with steviol addition
also in this mouse line.
Oral
stevioside
administration
decreases
hyperglycaemia.
To analyse the effects of stevioside on glucose metabolism in
conscious mice, we performed two i.p. glucose tolerance tests
(GTTs) in the same mice, combined with stevioside or vehicle
treatment, 2 weeks apart. Blood glucose values were significantly
reduced after stevioside treatment in WT, but not Trpm5 � / �
mice (Fig. 6a,b,g). This effect was even more pronounced in
obese WT mice, after 20 weeks of HFD, and equally absent
in Trpm5 � / � animals on HFD (Fig. 6c,d,g). Notably, both in
WT and Trpm5 � / � animals, we observed no acute effect of
stevioside administration on the glucose level in the fasting state
(Supplementary Fig. 10a). Even at very high dosage levels of
intravenous (i.v.) administration, stevioside and steviol do not
induce hypoglycaemia (Supplementary Fig. 10b,c).
To investigate whether the glucose-lowering effect of stevioside
is dependent on TRPM5 expression in pancreatic islets, we
transplanted pancreatic islets from Trpm5 � / � mice or WT mice
underneath the kidney capsule of WT-recipient mice that were
selectively depleted of their endogenous pancreatic b-cells by
alloxan injection34 (Supplementary Fig. 11a). Hyperglycaemia in
recipient mice was confirmed before implantation (day 0). After
transplantation, normoglycaemia was re-established (Suppleme-
ntary Fig. 11c,e, day 1). After recovery, acceptor mice showed
normal glycaemic profiles and body mass (Fig. 6e,f, solid lines;
Supplementary
Fig.
11b–e).
Only
mice
transplanted
with
WT islets showed a reduction in the glycaemia after stevioside
treatment (Fig. 6e–g). This effect was like the effect in WT mice.
Stevioside prevents glucose intolerance in mice on HFD. To
test the effect of chronic stevioside treatment on the development
of diet-induced diabetes, we randomly divided WT littermate
mice in two groups: one group receiving HFD (control), and
another group receiving HFD and stevioside. Their age, weight
and glycaemic profile at the start of the experiment were not
different (Fig. 7; Supplementary Fig. 12; Supplementary Table 2).
Subsequent i.p. GTTs showed a time-dependent development
of glucose intolerance in control mice on HFD (Fig. 7a,c).
After 20 weeks on HFD blood glucose levels at 2 h after the
glucose challenge, were as high as 300±53 mg dl � 1, which is
indicative for type 2 diabetes35. We observed a strong protective
effect of stevioside against the development of HFD-induced
glucose intolerance in WT mice (Fig. 7b,c). In comparison to
control mice, animals after 20 weeks of HFD þ stevioside
had plasma levels of 220±70 mg dl � 1 at 2 h after the glucose

Figure 5 | Two-bottle taste preference test. Preferences indicated are measured against water for sweet (1% sucrose), umami (150 mM monopotassium
glutamate—MKG), bitter (100 mM quinine—25 mM quinine for Tas1r2,Tas1r3( � / � )2 in a) or sour (10 mM citric acid) with or without 124 mM steviol or
SG supplemented to the drinking solution. (a) The bar graphs show either the preference (up bars) or avoidance (down bars) for the indicated compound in
a two-bottle preference test during 48 h. There is clear preference for stevioside (P ¼ 2 � 10 � 26, n ¼ 48 mice over four different experiments) and
rebaudioside A (P ¼ 2 � 10 � 21, n ¼ 24) in WT animals, and indifference to steviol (P ¼ 0.24, n ¼ 24, one sample t-test versus 0.5). Steviol increases the
perception of sweet (P ¼ 0.037), umami (P ¼ 0.001) and bitter (P ¼ 0.003, n ¼ 24, paired t-test) solution in WT animals, but not in Trpm5 � / � mice.
In Tas1r2,Tas1r3( � / � )2 mice bitter taste is potentiated by steviol (P ¼ 0.018) and stevioside (P ¼ 0.048, n ¼ 24, paired t-test). The indicated significances
show a difference between the taste compound and the taste compound together with steviol. (b) Initial taste preference presented as normalized

 challenge (P ¼ 0.04, two-sample t-test compared to untreated
animals). These mice maintained a normal glycaemic profile over
the course of 20 weeks of HFD (Fig. 7b). In Trpm5 � / � animals,
we observed no difference between the control and the stevioside-
treated group (Fig. 7d-f). WT and Trpm5 � / � mice, both the
control group and the stevioside-treated group, had a similar
body
weight
and
weekly
caloric
intake
(Supplementary
Fig. 12a,b,f,g). Notably, WT mice on HFD showed a significant
lower resting glycaemia when treated with stevioside, which was
not the case in Trpm5 � / � mice (Supplementary Fig. 12c,h).
The
increased
glucose
tolerance
in
stevioside-treated
WT animals is not due to increased islet size (Supplementary
Fig. 12e). Of note, islets from stevioside-treated mice did not
display the hypertrophy, which is apparent in WT HFD mice
(compare Supplementary Fig. 12e (HFD and HFDþ stevioside)
with Fig. 3g, black (control diet)). We also tested functional
responses of isolated pancreatic islets from these mice. Glucose-
induced Ca2 þ oscillations measured in islets from stevioside-
treated WT mice displayed the same sensitivity to stevioside
application as described above for untreated mice, while in islets
from Trpm5� / � mice these effects were equally absent (Supple-
mentary Fig. 12d,i). Weight gain during 20 weeks of HFD was
essentially the same between the control mice and stevioside-
treated mice (Supplementary Fig. 12a,f). To study this in more
detail, 20 WT mice were placed on HFD without regular GTT and
associated fasting, which reduces fluctuations in the body weight.
Start weight (20.7±0.2 g (control) and 20.9±0.4 g (stevioside);
P ¼ 0.69, n ¼ 10 mice per group, two-sample t-test) and weight
after 10 weeks of HFD (35.9±0.9 g (control) and 34.3±0.8 g
(stevioside) P¼ 0.20, two-sample t-test) was not different.
Insulin resistance of peripheral tissue is an important aspect of
type 2 diabetes36. To test insulin resistance, we performed an
insulin tolerance test in control WT mice, and WT mice that
received 124 mM steviol for 2 weeks via the drinking water
(B0.5 mg per day per mouse). The glycaemic changes after
insulin injections were not different between the two groups
(Supplementary Fig. 13a). The insulin sensitivity of mice
chronically fed a HFD with or without supplementation of
stevioside in their drinking water was assessed in a euglycaemic
hyperinsulinemic clamp test. Trpm5 � / � animals showed no
difference in insulin sensitivity compared to WT animals
(Fig. 7g,h; Supplementary Fig. 13b,c). The glucose infusion rate
to reach euglycaemia in animals on a HFD was not different
from the animals that were on HFD þ stevioside, indicating
that stevioside consumption does not alter the insulin sensitivity
(Fig. 7i,j). Both groups on the HFD were, however, significantly
insulin-resistant compared to normal WT animals (Fig. 7i,j versus
Fig. 7g,h; Supplementary Fig. 13b,c). Note the difference in
glycaemia before infusion of glucose between stevioside-treated
mice and control mice (Fig. 7i). To test an acute effect of steviol

as the difference in area under the curve between the two GTTs,
was the same when comparing the control and the stevioside-
treated group (Supplementary Fig. 14d, left, P ¼ 0.16, n ¼ 10 mice
per group, two-sample t-test). This indicates that stevioside has
no impact on incretin secretion from K- and L-cells in the gut.
Finally, the gut microbiome is an important factor in the
development of metabolic diseases such as diabetes37. We
analysed this effect by treating mice with broad-spectrum
antibiotics (ABX) in their drinking water, which leads to
dysbiosis of the microbial colonies in the gut38. After 6 weeks,
the effect of stevioside on the i.p. GTT was completely preserved
in the ABX-treated animals. The increase of the glycaemic values
after ABX treatment was the same in the stevioside-treated group
as in the control group (Supplementary Fig. 14c,d,e).
Withdrawal of stevioside leads to impaired glucose tolerance.
We tested the reversibility of stevioside’s effects on systemic
glucose homeostasis. We assessed glucose tolerance in WT mice
that received HFD in three scenarios: continuous (15 weeks)
treatment with stevioside (group 1), 10 weeks of HFD þ
stevioside followed by 5 weeks of HFD without stevioside
(group 2) and a group on HFD without stevioside for 15 weeks
(control—group 3; Fig. 8a; Supplementary Table 3). Mice received
124 mM stevioside in the drinking water, as above. This experi-
ment confirms that stevioside improves glucose tolerance in
HFD-treated mice (compare group 1 and 3; Fig. 8b,d). The most
striking result is discernible in group 2 where glucose tolerance
deteriorates in 5 weeks after stevioside is removed from the diet to
the level of the untreated group. Also, 5 weeks after stevioside
treatment is stopped, resting glycaemia is significantly higher in
group 2, compared to the level when stevioside was administered
(Fig. 8c,e,f; Supplementary Table 3). Finally, in this experimental
set-up,
stevioside
treatment
slightly
reduces
HFD-induced
weight gain (Fig. 8g, compare group 1, 2 and 3 at 10 weeks).
Group 2 mice show an HFD-induced increase in body weight
after stevioside treatment is ceased, resulting at the end of the
experiment (at 15 weeks) in a similar weight as the untreated
group (Fig. 8g; Supplementary Table 3).
Discussion
Our results can be summarized as follows: (i) we show that
TRPM5 is essential for the biological action of steviol and SGs;
(ii) we show that potentiation of TRPM5 ion channel activity by

and
(iii) potentiation of TRPM5 activity protects mice against the
development of HFD-induced hyperglycaemia. Our data indicate
that stevioside, rebaudioside A and their aglycon steviol are novel
leads for the further development of antidiabetic drugs targeting
TRPM5. Considering the tremendous health cost of type 2
diabetes and that stevioside is a widely used natural product,
we believe that stevioside might be a cost-effective compound
for the global battle against diabetes.
Steviol, stevioside and rebaudioside A are not direct agonists of
TRPM5, but potentiate Ca2 þ-dependent activity of the channel.
The steviol group of SGs is sufficient for the interaction, but the
interaction site on the TRPM5 protein remains unknown. Inside-
out patch-clamp experiments indicate that steviol can interact
with TRPM5 directly, independent of an intracellular signal
transduction pathway. On the other hand, our data do not
exclude other receptors for SGs, but, as outlined below, our data
strongly suggest that TRPM5 is essential for the effect of SGs on
taste sensation and glucose-induced insulin secretion.
Previously, it was shown that TRPM5 is essential for sweet,
bitter and umami taste detection, which are type II taste receptor
cell-dependent taste modalities6. Stevioside and steviol specifically
enhance these modalities in WT mice: avoidance of a bitter
compound (quinine) and preference for sweet (sucrose) and
umami (MKG). Sour taste (which is TRPM5-independent6) is not
affected. The effect of steviol and SGs on taste is divergent, in
a sense that avoidance and preference are intensified depending
on the tastant. The observation that taste preference is markedly
affected as short as 5 min into the preference test, excludes
a significant contribution of post-ingestive effects independent of
acute tasting. Taken together, our data are consistent with the
model that TRPM5-mediated depolarization of type II taste
receptor cells serves as the link between taste receptor activation
and initiation of afferent signalling via ATP release from these
cells, and that SG-mediated potentiation of TRPM5 activity
potentiates this signalling pathway (Fig. 9). Our data identify
steviol as a novel, potent and specific modulator of bitter, sweet
and umami taste, which is taste neutral on itself. It is tempting to
speculate that the extreme sweetness of SGs originates likely
from a dual interaction with the sweet taste receptor but also
via potentiation of TRPM5 channel activity, via its steviol core.
Steviol and SGs augment glucose-induced Ca2 þ oscillations
and insulin release in WT pancreatic islets, but not Trpm5 � / �
islets. These data are consistent with the idea that TRPM5 serves
as a facilitator of fast glucose-induced Ca2 þ oscillations, which
trigger insulin release (Fig. 9). This model was originally proposed
from our analysis of Trpm5 � / � mice10, and SGs are the first
compounds that can validate this hypothesis. It is worth noting
that steviol and SGs yield a very similar effect as GLP-1 on
glucose-induced Ca2 þ oscillations in islets. Interestingly, Shigeto
et al.32 could show that TRPM5 is directly involved in the signal
transduction in the pancreatic b-cell elicited by GLP-1. This
further supports the similar action of TRPM5 activators and
GLP-1R agonists. Our data exclude that the GLP-1R is involved
in the functional effect of steviol and SGs on pancreatic islets, as
the effect of stevioside and GLP-1 is additive, and the stevioside
effect is not affected by a GLP-1R blocker.
The dosage of stevioside used in the drinking water of mice in
both our drinking test and during the HFD experiments was
124 mM or 100 mg l � 1. This concentration is half of the
maximum allowed dosage of SGs in soft drinks allowed in the
European Union, and o25% of the suggested maximal dose by
the World Health Organization and Food and Agriculture
Organization39,40. Consumption of this dosage of stevioside in
the drinking water resulted in a plasma concentration of 396 nM
steviol in mice. We show that also at these physiological
concentrations steviol has clear effect on glucose-induced Ca2 þ
signalling in pancreatic islets, indicating that the dosages of
stevioside that we use are realistic and physiologically relevant.
It has been suggested that SGs interact with the mammalian sweet
taste receptor, TAS1R2/TAS1R3 (refs 29,30) and ATP-sensitive
Kþ channels in pancreatic b-cells41, which might explain some of
the data we observe. However, our results exclude that the
potentiating effect of steviol and stevioside on pancreatic islet
function
is
mediated
via
the
TAS1R2/TAS1R3
receptor.
We observed essentially the same effect of steviol and stevioside
on Ca2 þ signalling in Tas1r2,Tas1r3(� /� )2, as in WT islets.
Our observation that stevioside does not induce Ca2 þ signals and
insulin release in pancreatic islets in low-glucose conditions (3mM)
argues against the idea that stevioside would be a direct blocker
of ATP-sensitive Kþ channels.
Acute oral administration of stevioside reduces hyperglycaemia
in a GTT in WT, but not in Trpm5 � / � mice. Importantly,
the same effect is present in alloxan-diabetic WT-recipient
mice that received WT islets, but not in WT-recipient mice
that received Trpm5 � / � islets. This shows that the glucose-
lowering effect of stevioside is dependent on the expression of
TRPM5 in pancreatic islets, and not from a TRPM5-dependent
action in peripheral tissue outside of the pancreatic islet.
Long-term oral intake of stevioside improves the development
of plasma hyperglycaemia in WT mice on HFD, but not in
Trpm5 � / � mice. There was no difference in the development
of insulin resistance in the control and stevioside-treated
group. HFD-induced obesity in mice is commonly used for
the development of insulin resistance and IGT. Because obesity is

Figure 9 | Schematic overview of intracellular pathways in type II taste
receptor cells and pancreatic b-cells. Important factors in the regulation of
taste perception and insulin secretion, relevant for this work, are highlighted
in this figure. The effects of stevioside through TRPM5 are highlighted with
red arrows. In type II taste receptor cells, positive modulation of TRPM5
increases ATP release and afferent signalling from the receptor cell. In the
pancreatic b-cell, upon glucose application b-cells display parallel Vm and
[Ca2 þ]cyt oscillations, which drive insulin secretion. TRPM5 is active during
the lag phase in between bursts of action potentials, and determines the
frequency of Vm and Ca2 þ oscillations, which modulates insulin secretion:
enhanced TRPM5 activity results in a higher oscillation frequency, which
results in more insulin secretion. Note that steviol and its derivatives
(for example, stevioside) only enhance TRPM5 activity and insulin
secretion, but that glucose is the trigger for cell signalling. Instead,
sulfonylureas such as glibenclamide (not depicted) block KATP channels
directly and trigger Ca2 þ signalling and insulin secretion independent of
glucose transport.

 induced via food-intake/composition and not by genetic manip-
ulation, this model is considered to be relevant for the human
condition. Interestingly, two studies suggest that Trpm5 � / �
mice are resistant to diet-induced obesity; in Larsson et al.42 on
a HFD and in Glendinning et al.43 on a carbohydrate-based diet.
However, in both studies, Trpm5 � / � mice had a significantly
lower caloric intake, which could explain the apparent resistance
to obesity. In our study, WT and Trpm5 � / � mice had the same
caloric intake and gained the same amount of weight on HFD.
Similar as GLP-1, stevioside treatment is weight neutral or even
slightly limits weight gain during HFD. Furthermore, stevioside
and steviol do not induce hypoglycaemia. Stevioside enhances the
physiological profile of insulin secretion, instead of inducing
increased plasma insulin levels independent of plasma-glucose
concentrations, as sulfonylureas and exogenous insulin. In this
respect, we propose that TRPM5-potentiating compounds might
be functionally equivalent to GLP-1 mimetics. GLP-1R agonists
are highly successful in diabetes care. The drawback of current
GLP-1R agonists is the way of administration, as they are often
injectables, the high price and the short time of action44.
Although advances are being made in improving GLP-1R
agonists, the identification of TRPM5 as a new pharmacological
target with an analogous mode of action broadens the possibilities
for drug development.
Considering the epidemiological development of type 2
diabetes and the financial burden on public healthcare systems
worldwide, there is an eminent need to develop cost-effective
pharmacological interventions for this condition. An unmet need
on the anti-diabetes drug market is compounds that prevent or
delay the progression of the disease. Our data show that stevioside
has potent therapeutic effects for the prevention and treatment
of type 2 diabetes in mice, and we show that the molecular
mechanism of these effects is the potentiation of TRPM5 activity
in b-cells. Thus, we anticipate that TRPM5-potentiating drugs
are a bona fide target for the development of antidiabetic
drugs, and that steviol and its glycosylated derivatives are
interesting start compounds to develop this novel type of drugs.
Methods
Cell culture and transfection. HEK293T cells were obtained from American Type
Culture Collection and split twice weekly. Cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle’s medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 2 U ml � l penicillin and
2 mg ml � 1 streptomycin, and 2 mM L-glutamine. Cells were transfected with
Trpm3, Trpm8, Trpa1 or Trpv1 using Mirius transIT-293 transfection reagent.
Animals. All animal experiments were approved by the ethical committee for
animal welfare of the KU Leuven. Sample size was determined using a power
analysis based on the results of preliminary experiments. Mouse strains were
homozygously bred in a conventional animal facility. We used C57Bl6/J (WT) and
B6;129-Trpm5tm1Csz/J (Trpm5 � / �, obtained from C. Zuker, NY, USA) animals.
The Trpm5 � allele was backcrossed for 12 generations in C57Bl6/J background.
Sweet receptor knockout (Tas1r2,Tas1r3( � / � )2) mice were derived by crossing
B6;129-Tas1r2tm1Csz/J and B6;129-Tas1r3tm1Csz/J mice (obtained from Jax Labs).
Islets for Ca2 þ imaging were isolated from male and female mice aged
10–18 weeks, or after the diet study. Action potential recordings, static insulin
secretion, insulin secretion under dynamic perfusion and in vivo insulin
secretion (Fig. 4; Supplementary Fig. 5) was assessed in age-matched male
mice. For the insulin secretion experiments in supraphysiological conditions
(Supplementary Table 1), we used age-matched female mice. Drinking and licking
experiments were performed on male mice aged 10–20 weeks. Donor pups for the
transplantation experiments were used before visual sexing is possible and were
whole-litter mixed gender. Receptor animals were 6-week-old littermate WT mice.
Diet experiments were started with 7-week-old male mice. Male, 8-12 week old,
WT or Trpm5 � / � mice or mice after the diet test were used for the euglycaemic
clamp or insulin tolerance test.
Electrophysiology. HEK293T cells stably transfected with Trpm5 or Trpm4 were
developed using the Flp-In system (Life Technologies). The cells were seeded onto
poly-L-lysine-coated coverslips and incubated for 2 h. The coverslips were mounted
onto an inverted microscope equipped with a multichannel perfusion system.
We used the whole-cell patch-clamp configuration. A ramp protocol from
� 125 to þ 125 mV in 300 ms, from Vhold ¼ 0 mV, was applied to the cells at 1 Hz.
The current at þ 100 and � 100 mV was extracted to analyse time-dependent
current changes. We measured steady-state control conditions and peak currents
during the application of stevioside, rebaudioside A or steviol. Voltage dependency
of TRPM5 was analysed with a voltage-step protocol, from Vhold ¼ þ 25 mV,
consisting of a 75 ms test-pulse from � 175 to þ 150 mV in 25 mV increments.
The membrane potential was kept at � 125 mV for 50 ms before returning to
holding potential. The analysed current is the steady-state current at the end of the
test-pulse. This was fitted with the Boltzmann equation and V1/2 was calculated in
the presence of stevioside and in control conditions, of the same cells. The standard
external solution contained (mM) 150 NaCl, 6 KCl, 1.5 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 glucose
and 10 HEPES titrated with 1 M NaOH to a pH of 7.4. The appropriate amount of
stevioside was added to this solution. Our internal solution contained (mM)
50 NaCl, 100 N-methyl-D-glucamine, 10 HEPES, 4 K2ATP, 10 ethylene glycol
tetra-acetic acid and 8.62 CaCl2 (resulting in 1 mM of free Ca2 þ), titrated to
pH 7.2 with 1 M HCl. The internal solution for measuring in the absence of
intracellular calcium contained (mM) 50 NaCl, 100 N-methyl-D-glucamine,
10 HEPES, 4 K2ATP and 10 1,2-Bis(2-aminophenoxy)-ethane-N,N,N0,N0-tetra-
acetic acid, titrated to pH 7.2 with 1 M HCl.
For inside-out patch recordings, the bath and pipette solution contains in (mM)
156 NaCl, 1.5 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2 and 10 HEPES at pH 7.4, supplemented with 10 mM
steviol or 10 mM stevioside in the pipette as indicated. After excision, the patch is
kept in a calcium-free bath solution containing (mM) 150 NaCl, 1 MgCl2,
10 HEPES and 10 ethylene glycol tetra-acetic acid at pH 7.3. The calcium-
containing solution was (mM) 150 NaCl, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES and 0.5 CaCl2 at
pH 7.3 supplemented with 10 mM steviol in the indicated condition. The
stimulation protocol consists of a 500 ms step at � 100 mV immediately followed
by a 250 ms step to þ 100 mV at 1 Hz. The analysed currents are the steady-state
currents extracted at the end of the voltage step.
Membrane potential recordings in b-cells were performed using the perforated-
patch whole-cell configuration. The pipette solution contained (mM) 120
K-gluconate, 10 KCl, 10 NaCl, 1 MgCl2, 5 HEPES (pH 7.2 with KOH) and
0.24 mg ml � l amphotericin B, while the bath solution contained (mM) 140 NaCl,
3.6 KCl, 0.5 MgSO4, 1.5 CaCl2 and 10 HEPES (pH 7.2 with NaOH). Action
potential firing in isolated b-cells was induced by 100 mM tolbutamide or 20 mM
glucose and recorded in the presence, or the absence, of 10 mM stevioside. The
interval between subsequent action potentials was calculated and distribution was
compared using a non-parametric Wilcoxon sign-rank test in Matlab (R2012a).
To examine voltage dependency of the glucose-induced current, cells were held at
� 70 mV and stepped for 200 ms to voltages ranging from � 80 to þ 50 mV.
Calcium imaging on HEK cells. Cells were incubated with 1 mM FURA2-AM for
1 h and mounted on a fluorescence microscope equipped with a multichannel
perfusion system. Transfected cells were identified by green fluorescent protein
expression. FURA2 fluorescence was followed at 1 Hz sampling frequency.
Extracellular solutions as indicated above were used. We applied 10 mM stevioside,
10 mM steviol and used specific activators of the channels of interest as positive
control, that is, 2 mM capsaicin for TRPV1, 100 mM allyl isothiocyanate for TRPA1,
500 mM ( þ )menthol for TRPM8 and 20 mM pregnenolone sulphate for TRPM3.
Isolation of pancreatic islets and single cells. The Krebs solution for
preparation contained (in mM) 119 NaCl, 4.75 KCl, 1.2 MgSO4, 1.18 KH2PO4,
2.54 CaCl2, 5 NaHCO3, 20 HEPES and 5 glucose (pH 7.4). Collagenase
P (2 mg ml � l) was injected into the pancreatic duct of C57Bl6/J WT, Trpm5 � / �
or Tas1r2,Tas1r3( � / � )2 mice, followed by dissection of the pancreas. Digestion of
the whole pancreas was obtained by shaking for 8 min at 37 �C. After gravitational
sedimentation, islets were isolated by three rounds of handpicking. Islets
were cultured in advanced RPMI 1640 (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FCS,
100 U ml � 1 penicillin/streptomycin and 4 mM glutamax at 37 �C and 5% CO2.
Islets were dispersed into single cells by trypsin digestion. The cells were cultured
at 37 �C and 5% CO2 in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FCS,
10 U ml � 1 penicillin/streptomycin, and 10 mM glucose, for 24 h prior to
experimentation.
Calcium imaging on islets. Pancreatic islets were incubated with 1 mM
FURA2-AM for 1 h in a humidified incubator at 37 �C and 5% CO2. They were
mounted on an Olympus BX51W1 inverted fluorescence microscope equipped
with an UMPLANFL � 10 objective with a Bioptech objective heater set at 37 �C.
We used a Warner Instruments CL-100 temperature controlled multichannel
perfusion system, kept at 37 �C. Excitation was done with a Polychrome V licht-
source and image acquisition with an Andor iXon 888 camera, pre-amplifier
gain was set to 1, EM gain to 160 with the TILL Photonics Live Acquisition 2.3.0.18
software. We measured the fluorescence of whole pancreatic islets. The islets were
perfused with a solution containing (mM) 120 NaCl, 4.8 KCl, 1.2 MgCl2, 2.5 CaCl2
and 10 HEPES (pH 7.4) supplemented with the indicated amount of glucose and
stevioside or steviol. Depolarization of the islets with 30 mM KCl was used as
positive control at the end of the measurement. Ca2 þ oscillation frequency before
or during the application of stevioside was analysed. The FT frequency spectrum of
the first time derivative of the calcium oscillations was used in further analysis. The

 relevant oscillation frequencies between 0 and 0.05 Hz were determined. The
highest peak represents the dominant oscillation frequency and all frequencies
peaking at Z60% of the maximum were considered relevant frequencies. The
dominant oscillation frequency distribution during perfusion with 10 mM glucose
was compared with the dominant oscillation frequency during perfusion with
10 mM glucose and 10 mM stevioside or steviol with the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test.
On the basis of the oscillation frequency, the islets were divided into fast- (relevant
frequencies only 40.015 Hz), slow- (relevant frequencies only o0.015 Hz) or
mixed- (relevant frequencies in both parts of the FT spectrum) oscillating islets.
The proportion of fast-oscillating islets in control and stevioside conditions was
compared using Fisher’s exact test.
Insulin release. After isolation and overnight incubation, pancreatic islets from
six mice were pooled and transferred from the culture medium to 3 mM glucose
containing Krebs solution for 30 min. Individual islets were transferred to a well in
a 96-well plate with the appropriate glucose and stevioside concentration45.
After 60 min of incubation at 37 �C, the supernatant was collected. The experiment
was repeated twice, and insulin concentration was determined on duplicate
samples (Fig. 4a,b).
Insulin secretory capacity of the islets in G5, K30 and G20 was determined by
comparing the released insulin from pooled islets to the total insulin content of
these islets (Supplementary Table 1). The represented data are a result of five
independent experiments (mice) per genotype.
For in vivo insulin release experiment, fasted WT or Trpm5 � / � mice were
anaesthetised through an i.p. injection with 5 ml g–1 VDF (ventranquil:dormicum:
fentanyl:water 1:2:10:3). The mice received 2.5 g kg–1 glucose (30% solution in
H2O) or 2.5 g kg–1 glucose with 200 mg kg–1 stevioside at time point 0 min.
Blood samples were taken at 0 and 30 min. Blood was sampled by filling
heparinized capillaries through tail bleeding. The blood was centrifuged for 12 min
at 5,000 r.p.m. and 4 �C, and the plasma was collected for further analysis.
In all cases, the insulin concentration was determined using the Crystal Chem
Inc, USA, ultra-sensitive mouse insulin ELISA kit, as per the manufacturer’s
protocol.
Dynamic insulin secretion experiments. After overnight culture in RPMI
1640 containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, batches of 40–200 islets
were perifused at 37 �C at a flow rate of 1 ml min � 1. The perifusion medium
(pH 7.4) used for these experiments contained (in mM): 124 NaCl, 4.8 KCl,
2.5 CaCl2, 1.2 MgCl2, 20 NaHCO3, 1 mg ml � l bovine serum albumin and various
test agents as indicated. It was gassed with O2:CO2 (95:5%). Effluent was collected
every 2 min and insulin was measured by radioimmunoassay.
Stevioside treatment and HFD. Only male mice were used in the diet experi-
ments. After weaning, the mice were randomly allocated to a test group per
genotype and housed individual. At the age of 7 weeks, the diet was switched from
normal chow (ssniff spezialdia
¨ten, V1535-0) to pellets containing 30% (w/w)
saturated fat (ssniff spezialdia
¨ten, E15116-34), given ad libitum. There was a weekly
measuring of the body mass and the blood glucose. This resting glycaemia was
taken during the light cycle of the mice with a standard glucometer by a drop of
blood after tail puncturing in conscious unrestrained mice. The consumed food was
measured by weighting the on the grid pellets every week. There was free access to
drinking water and the supplementary drinking bottle from the indicated groups
was filled daily with a stevioside containing solution (25 mg stevioside per kg
in a 0.1% solution in water). The mice were monitored to consequently drink the
stevioside solution. In the experiments decribed in Fig. 8 and Supplementary Fig.
14, five mice were housed in one cage. Stevioside (100 mg l � 1) and
antibiotics (ABX—1 g l � 1 metronidazole and 200 mg l � 1 ciprofloxacin) were
added to the drinking water of the indicated groups. No animals were excluded
from the analysis, outliers in resting glycaemia or food consumption at a distinct
time point were attributed to experimental error and discarded from final analysis.
Glucose tolerance test. The mice were fasted overnight in their home cage before
the GTT with free access to water. Mice from different treatment groups were
evenly distributed over technical replicates of the GTT. The investigator was
blinded towards the treatment group the animal was allocated to. For the acute
stevioside administration, the mice received either 500 mg kg � 1 stevioside or the
same volume of vehicle via oral gavage 2 h before the start of the GTT. At time
0 min, they receive an i.p. injection of 2.5 g kg � 1 glucose in a 30% solution in
water. In the case of the oral GTT, the glucose is administered through oral gavage.
Glycaemia is followed at time points 0, 15, 30, 60 and 120 min using a standard
glucometer (Aviva Accu-Check). The tip of the tail was punctured with
a 26 G needle to initiate bleeding. After the GTT, the mice received ad libitum
feeding of their appropriate diet. At individual time points, we show
average±s.e.m. and the indicated significances are the result of a paired or
a two-sample t-test. We excluded animals were the maximal glycaemia did not
exceed 250 mg dl � 1 from analysis. The results of the GTT are also presented as
area under the curve of the glycaemia during the 120 min of the GTT.
Euglycaemic hyperinsulinemic clamp. Mice were fasted overnight before
the experiment. To obtain anaesthesia, mice under 40 g were i.p. injected with
a mixture of 3.125 mg kg � 1 acepromazine, 3.125 mg kg � 1 midazolam and
0.156 mg kg � 1 fentanyl while mice over 40 g received half this dose. A main-
tenance bolus of 18.75 mg acepromazine, 18.75 mg midazolam and 0.936 mg fentanyl
was subcutaneous injected every 45 min. An i.v. catheter was placed in the tail vein
and initially PBS was infused at 50 ml h � 1 for 40 min using syringe pumps and the
basal glycaemia was determined as the average measured at � 20 and � 10 min,
before the start of the hyperinsulinemic clamp. The mice received a bolus of 2.7 mU
insulin at 0 min and continuous infusion of 6.8 mU insulin per hour. In all,
12.5% glucose in PBS was i.v. infused at a variable rate to maintain euglycaemia,
determined every 5–10 min by tail bleeding. After 2 h, we infused 0.8 mmol kg � 1
steviol while maintaining the insulin and glucose infusions at the euglycaemic level.
Islet transplantations. Islets from 2–3-week-old WT or Trpm5 � / � donor mice
were isolated by collagenase digestion, washed and counted. Thereafter, islets were
transferred to silicon microtubing (Becton Dickinson, Erembodegem, Belgium),
and centrifuged for 5 min at 1,500 r.p.m. to create a compact pellet of islets for
injection46. Endogenous b-cells from 7-week-old WT-recipient mice were
selectively destroyed with 90 mg kg � 1 alloxan 2 days before transplantation. Severe
hyperglycaemia and glucosuria were confirmed in the recipient mice shortly before
transplantation. During transplantation, the mice were anaesthetized with
ketamine/xylazine i.p. (80–100 mg kg � 1 ketamine and 5–10 mg kg � 1 xylazine)
and the left kidney was exposed by a lumbar incision. Recipient mice were given
500 islets under the kidney capsule. Non-fasting blood glucose levels from the tail
vein of each recipient were measured to monitor functionality of the transplanted
islets, 1 day, 1 week and 4 months after transplantation. Mice recovered for 14 days
after surgery before a GTT was performed.
Plasma steviol concentration determination. Ten WT mice were given 124 mM
steviol in their drinking water during 21 days. Blood was collected after anaesthesia
by exsanguination through puncture of the maxillary vein. The plasma was
separated by 10 min centrifugation at 10,000 r.p.m. A liquid–liquid extraction was
employed as follows: to 50 ml of plasma, 1 ml (1 mg ml � 1 in MeOH) ibuprofen was
added as an internal standard. The mixture was vortexed and protein precipitation
was carried out adding 50 ml acetonitrile while vortexing. After centrifugation, the
upper layer was collected and 25 ml was injected. Liquid chromatography–mass
spectrometryanalysis was carried out using a UFLC Shimadzu system consisting of
a LC-20ADXR pump, a SIL-20ACXR autosampler, a DGU-20A3 degasser and a
CTO-20A oven (Shimadzu Prominence, Antwerpen, Belgium) in combination with
a 3200 QTRAP (ABSciex, Halle, Belgium) and Analyst software (version 1.5). The
instrument was operated in atmospheric pressure chemical ionization, negative-
single ion mode monitor m/z 317.1 (steviol) and m/z 205.2 (ibuprofen). The corona
discharge needle voltage was � 4,500 V and heated nebulizer temperature was set
at 500 �C for 0.5 ml min � 1 flow rate. Nitrogen was set as nebulizer gas, auxiliary
gas at 50 p.s.i. and curtain gas at 35 p.s.i. Other parameters were as follows:
declustering potential � 50 V, entrance potential � 10 V. Liquid chromatography
conditions: an Accucore C18 column (2.6 mm particle size, 2.1 mm � 100 mm)
was used. Mobile phases were (A) 20 mM amoniumacetate at pH 4.8 and (B)
acetonitrile. The used flow rate was 0.5 ml min � 1. The autosampler temperature
was set at 10 �C, the column oven at 30 �C. The method had following gradient
conditions 0–0.01 min: 20% B; 0.01–10 min: 70% B; 10–11: 20% B. Retention
times were defined as 7.07 (steviol) and 6.21 (ibuprofen). Calibration curves were
constructed using linear regression of the peak area ratios of steviol against internal
standard (ibuprofen). Calibration standards were prepared by spiking blank plasma
at concentrations 10, 50, 100, 250, 500, 1,000, 2,500, 5,000 ng ml � 1 (R2 ¼ 0.9926).
Drinking test. WT, Trpm5 � / � or Tas1r2,Tas1r3( � / � )2 mice were age-matched,
individually caged and given two drinking bottles. After an adaptation period the
animals drank 50% from each of the bottles containing deionized water. A test
solution was placed in one of the bottles, and after 24 h, the position of the bottles
was switched to control for a position preference. The bottles were weighted to
measure the intake from each bottle. All tastants were given in an increasing
stimulating order. The used solutions were 1% sucrose (sweet), the minimal
concentration for which a preference can be detected47. A stimulatory
concentration of 150 mM MKG; umami)48, 100 mM quinine (bitter) or 25 mM in
the Tas1r2,Tas1r3( � / � )2 mice on the 48 h taste preference test and 10 mM citric
acid (Sour). As stevioside tastes 300 times sweeter than sucrose and 3% sucrose is
preferred by WT mice to a great extent, we used 0.01% or 124 mM stevioside, and
similarly 124 mM rebaudioside A or steviol29,47. The same animals were used in the
control condition and the condition with steviol added and the indicated
significance is the result of a paired t-test from two individual experiments with
24–48 animals per group each. For the brief access drinking tests, we used
a custom-build lick-o-meter49. The mice were deprived from water for 23 h before
the experiment. Individual mice were placed in a cage equipped with a copper
grounding platform under two metal drinking spouts connected to an analogue/
digital converter. The drinking spouts were isolated except for the tip so only
tongue licks are recorded as a positive step of 25–150 mV. Custom software
recorded the junction potential at 200 Hz. We analysed potentials exceeding

 25 mV as a licking event. Licking events were recorded for 60 min. We analysed
the total number of licks and the fraction of licks from each bottle (per mouse)
over the complete time course to measure the 1 h preference. The first 5 min were
analysed for initial taste preference. For each mouse, the total number of licks was
normalized to avoid unequal contribution of extreme individuals. These
incremental licks were pooled and divided by the number of animals in the group
to yield the data in Fig. 5b–g and Supplementary Figs 7–9. Statistical significance
was assessed with paired or two-sample t-tests on the normalized fractions that
each mouse drank at the end of 5 min (Fig. 5f) or 60 min (Supplementary Fig. 6a,b).
The variance between individual mice in the same condition is displayed with the
data spread and the 25–75% data-interval boxplot, indicating the mean and median
of each group. The amount of licks in each condition for each mouse is represented
in Supplementary Fig. 6c–e for the 60 min lick-o-meter test and in Supplementary
Fig. 6f for the first 5 min.
Data analysis and statistics. We used Matlab R2012a, OriginPro 8.6, Microsoft
Excel and Igor Pro 6.34 for data analysis. Values deviating43 � s.d. of the
population mean were considered outliers. Normality was confirmed with the
Shapiro–Wilk test (95% confidence level). For significance testing, we used
two-tailed paired or unpaired t-test, unless otherwise indicated. For equivalence
testing, we used the two one-sided tests approach and withheld the largest P-value.
Data represent mean±s.e.m. Significance levels are indicated in the figures as
P40.05, not significant; *Po0.05; **Po0.01; ***Po0.001.
