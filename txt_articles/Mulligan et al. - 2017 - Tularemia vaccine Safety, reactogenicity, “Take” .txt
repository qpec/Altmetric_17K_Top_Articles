Abstract
Background—Tularemia is caused by Franciscella tularensis, a gram-negative bacterium that 
has been weaponized as an aerosol. For protection of personnel conducting biodefense research, 
the United States Army required clinical evaluation of a new lot of tularemia live vaccine strain 
manufactured in accordance with Current Good Manufacturing Practices.

 Methods—A phase 2 randomized clinical trial compared the new lot (DVC-LVS) to the existing 
vaccine that has been in use for decades (USAMRIID-LVS). The vaccines were delivered by 
scarification to 228 participants. Safety, reactogenicity, take and/or antibody levels were assessed 
on days 0, 1, 2, 8, 14, 28, 56, and 180.
Principal Results—Both vaccines were safe and had acceptable reactogenicity profiles during 
six months of follow-up. There were no serious or grade 3 and 4 laboratory adverse events. 
Moderate systemic reactogenicity (mostly headache or feeling tired) was reported by ~23% of 
participants receiving either vaccine. Injection site reactogenicity was mostly mild itchiness and 
pain. The frequencies of vaccine take skin reactions were 73% (95% CI, 64, 81) for DVC-LVS and 
80% (95% CI, 71, 87) for USAMRIID-LVS. The 90% CI for the difference in proportions was 
−6.9 % (−16.4, 2.6). The rates of seroconversion measured by microagglutination assay on days 28 
or 56 were 94% (95% CI, 88, 98; n = 98/104) for DVC-LVS and 94% (95% CI, 87, 97; n = 
103/110) for USAMRIID-LVS (p=1.00). Day 14 sera revealed more rapid seroconversion for 
DVC-LVS relative to USAMRIID-LVS: 82% (95% CI, 73, 89) versus 55% (95% CI, 45, 65), 
respectively (p<0.0001).
Major conclusions—The DVC-LVS vaccine had similar safety, reactogenicity, take and 
antibody responses compared to the older USAMRIID vaccine, and was superior for early (day 
14) antibody production. Vaccination take was not a sensitive surrogate for seroconversion in a 
multi-center study where personnel at five research clinics performed assessments.

“I know of no other infection of animals communicable to man that can be acquired 
from sources so numerous and so diverse. In short, one can but feel that the status 
of tularemia, both as a disease in nature and of man, is one of potentiality.”—
R. R. Parker, Proceedings of the Fifth Pacific Congress, 
1934.1
Introduction
Francisella tularensis is transmitted to humans via insect vectors such as ticks, mosquitoes, 
or biting deer flies, and by handling contaminated animal products or carcasses, particularly 
rabbits and rodents. 2–4 Fewer than 200 cases per year occur in the United States, mostly 
during summer and in the central South. F. tularensis is a non-motile, facultative 
intracellular, Gram-negative bacillus that is among the most infectious pathogenic bacteria 
known, causing human disease after inoculation, inhalation, or ingestion. As few as 10 
inhaled organisms cause disease.5,6 Two biovars have been described: type A, F. tularensis 
biovar tularensis, is the most common isolate in North America and is highly virulent in 
humans with an overall mortality rate of 5–7% if untreated;7 type B, F. tularensis biovar 
holarctica, is more common outside of the United States and is relatively avirulent.8 Type A 
F. tularensis is a dangerous potential biological weapon due to its high infectivity, ease of 
dissemination, and significant capacity to cause illness and death1,9,10 and has been 
classified as a category A bioterrorism agent by the Centers for Disease Control and

 Prevention. Japan, the Soviet Union, the United States and others have weaponized the 
bacterium as an aerosol.1
There is no effective licensed vaccine available for prevention of tularemia although >5,000 
people have received an investigational live, attenuated vaccine that prevents typhoidal 
disease (fever, headache, malaise, prostration, and often cough and chest pain) and 
ameliorates uleroglandular disease (local ulceration with regional adenopathy, fever, chills, 
and malaise) in laboratory workers.11 Experimentally-infected subjects who were treated 
with streptomycin when symptoms developed could clearly be re-infected upon repeat 
experimental challenge.5 Vaccination with killed vaccine did not prevent local lesions 
following cutaneous experimental challenge but did reduce systemic manifestations of 
infection4 and provided no protection following respiratory challenge.6 Live attenuated 
vaccines were first used in humans in the Soviet Union in 1942 and were brought to the 
United States by Shope in 1956.12 The live vaccine strain (LVS) delivered by scarification 
provided significant protection against typhoidal illness following respiratory challenge.6 
Following vaccination, the appearance of an erythematous papule, vesicle or eschar has been 
correlated with immunity, and this skin finding is designated a take reaction. In a 
retrospective analysis of all tularemia cases at the Fort Detrick research facility, it was 
concluded that typhoidal tularemia virtually disappeared following LVS administration 
(falling from 5.7 to 0.27 cases/1,000 employee years at risk) and ulceroglandular disease 
decreased significantly in clinical severity.13
The United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases-LVS 
(USAMRIID-LVS) vaccine12 has been used under an investigational new drug (IND) 
application for decades5,6 but the supply is limited and aging. Therefore the Department of 
Defense contracted with Dynport Vaccine Company (DVC) to produce a new lot of LVS 
using Current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP). After pre-clinical work14, a phase 1 
trial of escalating doses of the new DVC-LVS lot administered to 70 subjects concluded that 
vaccine delivery by scarification was safe, tolerable, and produced superior antibody 
responses than subcutaneous delivery.15 The goals of the phase 2 trial reported here were to 
directly compare the new DVC-LVS lot to USAMRIID-LVS in 228 subjects by defining the 
kinetics of antibody responses; comparing injection site reactions following scarification 
with vaccines versus saline; and correlating antibody responses with take.
Methods
Study design
We conducted a phase 2, multi-center, double-blind, randomized trial comparing the F. 
tularensis DVC-LVS and USAMRIID-LVS vaccines. The planned study population was 
approximately 220 healthy male and non-pregnant female subjects aged 18–45 years. 
Eligibility criteria are at ClinicalTrials.gov - identifier NCT01150695. The protocol and 
consent form were reviewed by the US Food and Drug Administration, and approved and 
monitored by the sites’ institutional review boards. Subjects were randomized to receive a 
single dose of DVC-LVS or USAMRIID-LVS by scarification in one arm. All received 
normal saline (NS) by scarification in the contralateral arm (a control). Following 
vaccination (day 0) subjects were followed for safety, reactogenicity, immunological

 responses and/or take on days 1, 2, 8, 14, 28, 56, and 180. The primary objectives were: to 
assess the frequency of serious adverse events (SAEs) and Grade 3 and 4 laboratory values 
following vaccinations; to assess the frequency of take (defined below) following 
vaccinations; and to assess the rate of seroconversion following vaccinations as measured by 
a tularemia-specific microagglutination assay.
Sponsor and Study sites
The study was sponsored by the US government’s National Institutes of Health/National 
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases/Division of Microbiology and Infectious 
Diseases (NIH/NIAID/DMID), conducted in collaboration with USAMRIID, and performed 
at five DMID Vaccine and Treatment Evaluation Units (VTEUs): Emory University School 
of Medicine; University of Iowa; Baylor College of Medicine; Saint Louis University; and 
University of Maryland School of Medicine. A central laboratory (University of Maryland 
School of Medicine) performed the serum antibody assays and a central statistical and data-
coordinating center (EMMES Corporation) performed the data management.
Vaccines
USAMRIID-LVS was produced in the 1960s by the National Drug Biologic Research 
Company (Swiftwater, Pennsylvania). The lyophilized vaccine (lot number NDBR 101 lot 4) 
contained live, attenuated F. tularensis; modified casein partial hydrolysate medium; sucrose 
gelatin agar stabilizer solution; and glucose cysteine hemin agar. Prior to reconstitution, all 
USAMRIID-LVS vials were tested for container integrity using the “SPARK” test in which 
a high frequency generator is used to test for the presence of a vacuum. Vials not passing 
this test were discarded. Two mL of sterile water for injection (WFI) were used to 
reconstitute the vaccine. Each multi-dose vial of USAMRIID-LVS contained ~1.0 x 109 
CFU/mL.
DVC-LVS was produced using cGMP by DVC (Frederick, Maryland). NDBR 101 Lot 4 of 
USAMRIID-LVS was the seed material. DVC-LVS Lot No. 703-0505-020 was used in this 
study. Lyophilized DVC-LVS was reconstituted with 0.25 mL WFI. The reconstituted 
vaccine contained ~1 x 109 CFU/mL in 10% sucrose, 1.9% gelatin and 10 mM potassium 
phosphate. After reconstitution, vaccines were stored at 2–8°C and used within 8 hours. NS 
for the control scarifications was supplied as single dose vials (Hospira Inc., Lake Forest, 
Illinois).
After cleansing the skin with acetone, the vaccines or NS were administered by scarification 
of the volar surface of the forearm midway between the wrist and the elbow. 100 μl of 
solution (containing 108 CFU or saline) was drawn into a tuberculin syringe; the needle was 
removed and one drop was placed on the skin. A bifurcated needle (Fisher BioServices, 
Washington, DC) was used to puncture the skin 15 times through the drop in an 0.5cm2 area. 
A trace amount of blood at the site was evidence of successful vaccine delivery. The site was 
allowed to air dry for 3–5 minutes before blotting with a dry sterile gauze.

 Safety and reactogenicity monitoring
Unsolicited adverse events (AE) and abnormal laboratory values were assessed through day 
28 and SAEs were collected through day 180. Solicited systemic and injection site 
reactogenicity symptoms were recorded by the subjects on diary cards through day 28 and 
followed until resolution. Study staff performed examinations at clinic visits and recorded 
dimensions of injection site erythema and induration.
Antibody assay
Antibody responses were measured by a tularemia-specific microagglutination assay 
performed as previously described14,15 on days 0, 14, 28, 56 and 180.
Take reactions
Take was defined as the development of an erythematous papule, vesicle, and/or eschar with 
or without underlying induration by days 7–9 as assessed by the VTEUs’ staffs. As a 
secondary assessment of take, digital photographs of both scarification sites (vaccine and 
control) were obtained at clinic visits, uploaded to a central study database, and assessed by 
an independent take evaluation committee of three blinded experts familiar with reactions 
after scarification. Both the site staff and the take evaluation committee categorized 
vaccination site reactions at each visit into one of several categories (Supplemental Table 1).
Statistical analyses
For the safety and reactogenicity analyses, all vaccinated subjects were included. The 
intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses of immunogenicity and take included all subjects who had 
at least one available measurement. The per protocol (PP) analyses of immunogenicity and 
take included subjects who met all inclusion and exclusion criteria, whose day 28 and 56 
visits occurred within protocol-specified windows (between days 26–30 and days 49–63, 
respectively), and who contributed both pre- and post-vaccination blood samples for which 
valid results were reported. For safety and seroconversion categorical variables, 95% exact 
(Clopper-Pearson) confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for each proportion and 
comparisons were carried out using a two-sided Fisher’s exact test. The geometric mean and 
associated 95% CI was used to summarize microagglutination titers. The primary 
immunogenicity endpoint was the proportion of subjects who seroconverted (>4-fold rise in 
titer) at days 28 or 56. Peak microagglutination titer was defined as the maximum titer 
reported for days 14, 28 or 56. Treatment comparisons were carried out using a two-sided t-
test. For the take endpoint a 90% CI of the difference in positive take proportions (Wald 
asymptotic CI) was determined and used to evaluate significance. Except for take rate 
comparisons, an individual alpha level of 5% was applied for all tests. Except as noted once 
below, results across the five sites did not differ and aggregate results are presented.

Enrollment and Demographics
Enrollment occurred between September 2010 and May 2011, and the last study visit was in 
January 2012. The dispositions for the 509 participants who were enrolled and screened, and

 the 228 (45%) eligible participants who were randomized and vaccinated, are summarized 
(Figure 1). 113 participants received DVC-LVS and 115 received USAMRIID-LVS. Unless 
noted, this report presents the PP analyses as the ITT results were similar. The randomized 
subjects’ demographic characteristics were well balanced between the two study groups 
(Supplemental Table 2).
Safety
Both vaccines appeared safe. There were no SAEs and no grade 3 or 4 laboratory AEs. No 
subject in either group had changes in hematology or chemistry values greater than mild in 
severity. 152 unsolicited AEs were reported by 107 subjects: 53 of 113 subjects (47%) in the 
DVC-LVS group and 54 of 115 (47%) in the USAMRIID-LVS group (p=1.00) 
(Supplemental Figure 1A). One migraine headache after DVS-LVS vaccination was severe 
but unrelated; the remaining 151 unsolicited AEs were mild to moderate. The unsolicited 
AEs were graded as related (n=44 events) or unrelated (n=108) to vaccination. 16 of 113 
(14%) DVC-LVS subjects had vaccine-related AEs while 26 of 115 (23%) USAMRIID-LVS 
subjects had related AEs (p=0.124) (Supplemental Figure 1B); most common were 
vaccination site satellite lesions that were mild in severity and resolved without sequelae 
(n=7 and 13, respectively).
Reactogenicity
Injection site reactogenicity was mostly mild and was similar for the two vaccines (Table 
1A). The most prevalent injection site reactions for both vaccines were itchiness and pain. 
Pain occurred in 49.6% of vaccine sites and 11.5% of NS control sites in the DVC-LVS 
group, as compared to 44.3% of vaccine sites and 12.2% of NS sites in the USAMRIID-LVS 
group (p values 0.507 and 1.00, respectively). Severe vaccine site reactions based on lesion 
diameter (erythema or induration >5cm) occurred for 5 (4.4%) DVC-LVS scarification sites 
and 4 (3.5%) USAMRIID-LVS sites (p=0.747) (Table 1B); there were no severe reactions 
for NS. In general for both vaccines the vaccination site lesions had largely healed by 21–28 
days. No lymphangitis was observed.
There were no significant differences in none/mild versus moderate/severe solicited systemic 
symptoms (p=0.118) (Table 2). Symptoms were mostly mild and occurred over the first few 
days post-vaccination. In the DVC-LVS group, 2 subjects (2%) experienced severe and 27 
subjects (24%) experienced moderate systemic reactions. In the USAMRIID-LVS group, 3 
subjects (3%) experienced severe and 25 subjects (22%) experienced moderate systemic 
reactions. Headache and feeling tired were the two most commonly reported systemic 
reactogenicity symptoms, each occurring in approximately one-third of subjects.
Take
LVS delivered by scarification was expected to cause small injection site take reactions. 
Since take has been used as a surrogate for immunogenicity, we evaluated the utility of take 
in this multi-center clinical trial. Before study start investigators and staff received fairly 
extensive training in assessing scarification site lesions including written definitions and 
sample photographs for lesion categories including erythema, papule, vesicle, pustule, and 
eschar (Supplemental Table 1). Based on the blinded investigator categorizations of the

 scarification site appearances at each study visit (representative digital photographs, Figure 
2), the data center determined take rates for the two vaccines and NS. USAMRIID-LVS 
resulted in higher take rates than DVC-LVS in both ITT and PP analyses (~80% compared to 
~70%) (Table 3A) but the null hypothesis of equality of positive take proportions between 
DVC-LVS and USAMRIID-LVS was rejected with alpha=0.10 for only ITT but not PP. For 
the PP population, the 90% CI for the difference in proportions was −6.9 % (−16.4, 2.6%). 
Take rates at the 5 clinical trial sites differed significantly after controlling for vaccine type 
(p=0.022). While two of the clinics had take rates between 88–93%, the other three clinics’ 
take rates ranged between 66–73%. The five clinics’ categorizations of the NS control sites 
were not different (p=0.184), nor were there differences in their microagglutination 
seroconversion rates (p=0.35, PP population).
For a secondary objective, an independent take committee also categorized lesion 
appearances by reviewing digital photographs of the vaccination sites. While DVC-LVS 
resulted in higher take rates than USAMRIID-LVS (~93% compared to ~87%) in both ITT 
and PP analyses (Table 3B), the null hypothesis of equality of positive take proportions 
between DVC-LVS and USAMRIID-LVS was rejected with alpha=0.10 for only PP but not 
ITT. For the PP population, the 90% CI for the difference in proportions was 7.1% (0.6, 
13.7%). Interestingly, assessments of the contralateral arm NS control scarification sites by 
both clinic investigators (physical exam) and the take committee (photographs) met the take 
definition for 10% of subjects.
Antibody response
The two vaccines demonstrated no difference in the primary immunogenicity endpoint 
(proportion seroconverting at day 28 or 56): 94% for both vaccines. Interestingly, at an 
earlier time-point (day 14), DVC-LVS had a higher seroconversion proportion than DVC-
USAMRIID: 85 /104 subjects (82% [95% CI, 73, 89]) versus 60/109 subjects (55% [95% 
CI, 45, 65]), respectively (p<0.0001) (Figure 3A).
The peak (day 14, 28, or 56) geometric mean titers (GMT) did not differ: 1166 (95% CI: 
911, 1493) for DVC-LVS, and 1225 (95% CI: 946, 1586) for USAMRIID-LVS (p=0.786). 
Similar to the seroconversion rate, the day 14 GMT for DVC-LVS was significantly higher 
than for DVC-USAMRIID: 144 (95% CI, 118, 176) vs. 70 (95% CI, 59, 82), respectively 
(p<0.0001) (Figure 3B). For all other time-points there were no significant seroconversion or 
GMT differences (Supplemental Table 3). There was no interaction between either vaccine 
and gender or vaccine and age for microagglutination antibody log fold rises from baseline 
across post-vaccination days when fitting a linear mixed-effects model (not shown).
We assessed the overlaps between take and seroconversion for 214 subjects across both 
vaccine groups who had measurements by both methods (investigator lesion assessment and 
antibody seroconversion). Among these subjects, 201 seroconverted; 13 did not. When 
seroconversion is taken as the gold standard, the true positive rate (sensitivity) for takes was 
77% (154 of 201 seroconverters had takes) and the true negative rate (specificity) was 23% 
(only 3 of 13 non-seroconverters were scored as not having takes) (Supplemental Table 4).

 Discussion
The new DVC-LVS vaccine lot performed well relative to the USAMRIID-LVS vaccine. 
Both vaccines appeared safe and were tolerated well in the study population. The generally 
accepted serological correlate of effective immunization (seroconversion in the 
microagglutination assay) was observed in 94% of subjects with both vaccines.
At the earliest post-vaccination time-point (day 14), antibody seroconversion and GMT were 
significantly better for the new lot of vaccine. The more rapid development of an antibody 
response could be an advantage for either post-exposure prophylaxis or in an ongoing F. 
tularensis bioterrorism event or outbreak scenario where rapid pre-exposure prophylaxis is 
desired. The reason for the more rapid development of antibody response with DVC-LVS is 
unknown. One hypothesis for the day 14 effect is that the decades-old USAMRIID-LVS 
vaccine has begun to lose replication capacity and takes longer to “get out of the gate” – 
although both vaccines continued to pass ongoing stability testing programs. Alternatively, 
since the new DVC-LVS vaccine was derived from USAMRIID-LVS and was produced 
using modern cGMP methods and in a fermenter rather than shaker flasks, lineage and/or 
processing differences could be responsible for the different behavior of the vaccines.
In this multicenter trial, the correlation between antibody seroconversion and vaccine take 
was poor. If seroconversion is used as the gold standard, take underestimated vaccine 
response and resulted in false negatives. Furthermore, specificity was low (23%) and 10% of 
NS injection reactions were categorized as takes. In addition, there were site-to-site 
differences in the observed take rates. These take results occurred despite utilizing 
experienced vaccine investigators, including several with experience in successfully 
assessing takes following scarification with the smallpox vaccine Dryvax®, and an extensive 
education/training program including photographic examples to guide lesion assessments in 
the clinics. It is difficult to determine what additional steps could be taken to improve take 
sensitivity and specificity under similar circumstances in the future. Possibly if investigators 
without a long history of assessing LVS takes are required to administer the vaccine, more 
emphasis will need to be placed on the immunogenicity results than the take rate.
One limitation of this report is its immunological focus on the antibody response on day 14 
and later. However additional analyses of the innate and cellular responses are being 
conducted. These studies may provide additional mechanistic insights into the more rapid 
DVC-LVS antibody response.
In conclusion, the safety, tolerability and antibody responses exhibited by the two vaccines 
were very similar suggesting that the DVC-LVS vaccine could replace the current 
USAMRIID-LVS vaccine if the latter vaccine were to become unavailable for human use.

 Figure 1. CONSORT diagram
The diagram details the dispositions for all participants who were enrolled and screened, and 
for eligible participants who were randomized and vaccinated.
1All enrolled and vaccinated subjects are included in the safety data analyses.
2The intention to treat (ITT) analysis population for the immunogenicity analyses includes 
all subjects.
3The per protocol (PP) analysis population for the immunogenicity analyses include 
subjects who met all inclusion and exclusion criteria, whose visits 7 and 8 were within 
protocol-specified windows (between days 26–30 and 49–63, respectively) and who 
contributed both pre- and post-vaccination blood samples for testing for which valid results 
were reported. Fourteen of the 228 subjects randomized and vaccinated were excluded from 
the per protocol immunogenicity analyses.

 Figure 2. Digital Photographs of Representative Scarification Sites Categorized as Takes, by 
Study Visit
For selected days post-scarification, vaccine scarification sites and one saline scarification 
site are shown. The appearances of scarification sites for the two study vaccines were similar 
and so vaccine groups are not specified here. Take was defined as the development of an 
erythematous papule, vesicle, and/or eschar with or without underlying induration by days 
7–9 as assessed by the VTEUs’ staffs.

Functional Grading. B. Measurement Grading.
A. Functional Grading Mild events required minimal or no treatment and did not interfere with the subject’s daily activities. Moderate events resulted in a low level of inconvenience or 
concern and caused some interference with functioning. Severe events interrupted a subject’s usual daily activity and may have required systemic drug therapy or other treatment. Severe 
events are usually incapacitating.
