Abstract
Background and 
Aims: Vedolizumab is a gut-selective α4β7 integrin antagonist therapy for ulcerative 
colitis and Crohn’s disease. 
The GEMINI long-term safety [LTS] trial is an ongoing open-label study 
investigating the safety of vedolizumab. We present interim exploratory analyses of efficacy in 
patients with Crohn’s disease.
Methods: Patients from the C13004, GEMINI 2 and GEMINI 3 studies and vedolizumab-naïve 
patients could enrol in GEMINI LTS and received vedolizumab every 4 weeks. Data were collected 
from May 22, 2009 to June 27
, 2013. Outcomes of clinical response and remission, defined by 
the Harvey-Bradshaw Index, and health-related quality of life [HRQL] were assessed for up to 
152 weeks of treatment in the efficacy population.
Results: Among patients with response at week 6 in GEMINI 2 who received vedolizumab 
continuously, 83% [n=100/120] and 89% [n=62/70] of patients with available data were in remission 
after 104 and 152 weeks, respectively. Increased dosing frequency from every 8 weeks [GEMINI 2] 
to every 4 weeks [GEMINI LTS] improved outcomes in patients who had withdrawn early from

 GEMINI 2, with 47% [n=27/57] experiencing clinical response and 32% [n=18/57] in remission at 
week 52 of GEMINI LTS [up from 39% and 4% before the dose increase]. Similar improvements 
were observed regardless of prior tumour necrosis factor [TNF] antagonist exposure. Long-term 
benefits of HRQL were also observed.
Conclusions: The clinical benefits of vedolizumab continued with long-term treatment regardless 
of prior 
TNF antagonist exposure. Increased dosing frequency might improve outcomes in patients 
who lose response to conventional 8-weekly dosing.

1. Introduction
Crohn’s disease [CD] is a chronic idiopathic inflammatory bowel 
disease [IBD] characterized by inflammation that usually occurs in 
the ileum and proximal colon. Patients typically present with symp-
toms of abdominal pain, diarrhoea and fatigue.1,2 Conventional 
non-biologic therapies include corticosteroids, thiopurines and meth-
otrexate.1–4 Biologic therapies such as tumour necrosis factor [TNF] 
antagonists are usually reserved for patients who fail conventional 
treatment.1,2 However, the long-term value of many of these agents 
may be limited by lack of efficacy and/or the potential for serious side 
effects.2,5 For example, approximately 40% of patients either fail to 
respond to TNF antagonist induction therapy or lose response over 
time.2 There remains a need for effective and safe long-term therapy.
Vedolizumab, a monoclonal antibody specifically targeting the 
α4β7 integrin heterodimer, is a new treatment for moderately to 
severely active CD.6 Vedolizumab inhibits migration of α4β7 integrin-
positive inflammatory cells into intestinal tissue by blocking their 
interaction with endothelial cells expressing mucosal addressin cell 
adhesion molecule-1 [MAdCAM-1].7–9 MAdCAM-1 is preferentially 
– but not exclusively – expressed in the gastrointestinal tract,10 pri-
marily restricting the suppressive effect of vedolizumab on inflam-
matory cell migration to the gut, in contrast to other biologic agents, 
such as TNF antagonists, which have systemic effects.
We present interim analysis of data from the continuing GEMINI 
long-term safety [LTS] study [ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT00790933] 
describing the clinical efficacy of long-term vedolizumab treatment 
in patients with moderately to severely active CD. We were specifi-
cally interested in the durability of clinical benefit associated with 
continued therapy, experience with vedolizumab retreatment follow-
ing interrupted therapy, and the value of increased dosing frequency 
from every 8 weeks to every 4 weeks. Efficacy data were analyzed 
for the overall patient population as well as stratified by prior TNF 
antagonist exposure. Safety data are summarized.
2. Methods
2.1. Study design and patient enrolment
GEMINI LTS was an ongoing single-arm, open-label phase 3 exten-
sion study in patients with CD and ulcerative colitis at 292 centres 
internationally at the time of these interim analyses. The primary 
objective was to evaluate the safety profile of long-term vedolizumab 
treatment. Patient-reported health-related quality of life [HRQL] 
assessments and efficacy endpoints of response and remission were 
pre-specified exploratory objectives. This interim report represents 
efficacy data for patients with moderately to severely active CD 
enrolled in GEMINI LTS from May 22, 2009 to June 27, 2013.
The study was designed and implemented by the GEMINI 
Steering Committee [see online Supplementary Material] in 
collaboration with the sponsor [Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 
d/b/a Takeda Development Center Americas, Inc.]. The study proto-
col was reviewed and approved by the institutional review board[s] 
and/or independent ethics committee[s] at each participating inves-
tigational centre. GEMINI LTS is being conducted compliant with 
good clinical practice and applicable regulatory requirements and 
according to the ethical principles founded in the Declaration of 
Helsinki.11 All patients gave written informed consent.
Patients from qualifying studies, which included the long-term 
phase 2 C13004 study [ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT00619489]12 
and the phase 3 GEMINI 2 [ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT00783692] 
and GEMINI 3 [ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT01224171] studies were 
eligible for enrolment.13,14 The remainder of the CD population 
were vedolizumab naïve and enrolled directly into GEMINI LTS 
[Supplementary Figure 1]. As of June 27, 2013, the maximum dura-
tion of exposure for patients in the vedolizumab-naïve cohort was 
399 days [57 weeks]. In contrast, patients who entered the study 
from GEMINI 2 or GEMINI 3 had a maximum duration of exposure 
of up to 1531 days [219 weeks] or 948 days [135 weeks], respec-
tively. Interim data for up to 100 weeks of vedolizumab treatment in 
GEMINI LTS are reported here with the potential for approximately 
3 years [152 weeks] of total exposure for patients who completed the 
52-week GEMINI 2 study.
Patients were withdrawn from the study if they met any of the cri-
teria for long-term treatment failure [i.e. need for rescue medication, 
major surgical intervention for the treatment of CD, and occurrence of 
a study drug-related adverse event that led to discontinuation], if they 
were not benefiting from therapy [in the opinion of the investigator 
or patient] or if they became pregnant. Furthermore, withdrawal of 
therapy was strongly recommended for patients who required recur-
rent courses of corticosteroids or those who could not discontinue 
these drugs beyond 6 months because of persistent disease activity.
2.1.1. GEMINI 2 patients
GEMINI 2 was a randomized placebo-controlled trial designed to 
explore the safety and efficacy of vedolizumab induction and main-
tenance therapy in patients with moderately to severely active CD 
[Supplementary Figure 1]. Details of the GEMINI 2 study design 
have been published elsewhere.13 Briefly, during the induction phase, 
patients enrolled in Cohort 1 were randomized 3:2 to receive either 
vedolizumab or placebo and those enrolled in Cohort 2 received 
open-label vedolizumab; all patients were dosed at weeks 0 and 
2. Patients from both cohorts who responded to therapy (i.e. ≥70-
point decrease from baseline in the Crohn’s Disease Activity Index 
[CDAI] score) at week 6 were randomized to receive vedolizumab 
maintenance therapy every 4 weeks or every 8 weeks or placebo (the 
maintenance intent-to-treat [ITT] population). Patients who did not 
respond to vedolizumab at week 6 and those originally assigned to 
placebo during the induction phase received vedolizumab or placebo,

 respectively, every 4 weeks [maintenance non-ITT population] or dis-
continued from the study [Supplementary Figure 1].13 Patients from 
GEMINI 2 who completed or withdrew early because of sustained 
non-response, disease worsening or the need for rescue medication 
[Supplementary Table 1], and for whom, in the opinion of the investi-
gator, the study drug was well tolerated could enrol in GEMINI LTS.
2.1.2. GEMINI 3 patients
GEMINI 3 was a 10-week induction trial in which patients with 
moderately to severely active CD were randomized 1:1 to receive 
three doses of vedolizumab or placebo at weeks 0, 2 and 6.14 Unlike 
GEMINI 2, which included a broad patient population, GEMINI 
3 assessed induction therapy in patients who, in the majority, had 
failed a TNF antagonist. Only completers of GEMINI 3 were eligible 
for GEMINI LTS enrolment.
2.1.3. Vedolizumab-naïve patients
Eligibility criteria for vedolizumab-naïve patients were similar to those 
specified in GEMINI 2 except for the use of the Harvey-Bradshaw 
Index [HBI] in GEMINI LTS instead of the CDAI to define disease 
activity for enrolment.13 The HBI is a simplified version of the CDAI 
that consists of five items [general well-being, abdominal pain, number 
of liquid stools per day, abdominal mass and complications]. Scores 
range from 0 to ≥18 with higher scores indicating greater disease 
activity.15 Scores of ≤4 are observed in patients who are in remission. 
The HBI score has been extensively correlated with the CDAI score 
and has been demonstrated to be responsive to meaningful change in 
disease activity. Eligible vedolizumab-naïve patients had an HBI score 
of 8–18 [moderately to severely active CD] within 7 days before the 
first dose of vedolizumab and at least one of the following additional 
criteria: a C-reactive protein [CRP] concentration >2.87 mg/l; ileoco-
lonoscopy with evidence of ≥3 non-anastomotic or ≥10 aphthous 
ulcerations within 4 months before screening; or a faecal calprotectin 
concentration >250 μg/g and evidence of CD ulcerations on imaging 
within 4 months before screening. Vedolizumab-naïve patients were 
ineligible if they had any prior exposure to natalizumab, efalizumab 
or rituximab, or had received adalimumab or any investigational 
or approved non-biological therapy for IBD in the past 30 days, or 
had received infliximab, certolizumab pegol or any investigational or 
approved biological agent within the past 60 days.
2.2. Treatment regimen and follow-up
Participants received intravenous vedolizumab 300 mg every 
4 weeks. Patients could continue treatment until December 2016 
[or March 2016 in countries where the drug is commercially avail-
able] or until withdrawal. For C13004, GEMINI 2 and GEMINI 3 
patients, the first dose of open-label vedolizumab in GEMINI LTS 
was given no later than 9 weeks after the last dose of study drug 
[placebo or vedolizumab] in the prior study.
Patients could continue to receive stable doses of aminosalicylates 
and corticosteroids [≤30 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent] during 
GEMINI LTS; however, at sites in the United States, patients with a 
clinical response to vedolizumab or who, in the opinion of the inves-
tigator, demonstrated sufficient improvement in clinical signs and 
symptoms were tapered off corticosteroids using a defined regimen 
[Supplementary Material] required by the United States Food and 
Drug Administration for these investigational studies. Outside of 
the United States, corticosteroid tapering was recommended, but not 
required. Immunosuppressives [i.e. azathioprine, mercaptopurine and 
methotrexate] were permitted at stable doses at sites outside of the 
United States only.
2.3. Evaluation of safety
Patients were evaluated at least every 4 weeks during treatment. 
At each visit, including unscheduled visits, the patients’ vital signs, 
concomitant medications and procedures, adverse events and seri-
ous adverse events were recorded. Adverse events were reported 
according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities and 
were defined as any untoward medical occurrence. Serious adverse 
events were defined as any adverse event that was life-threatening 
or resulted in death, required hospitalization or was considered 
an important medical event, or resulted in significant disability or 
birth defect, or as any occurrence of progressive multifocal leucoen-
cephalopathy [PML]. Infusion-related reactions were defined as any 
adverse event that occurred on the calendar day of or one calendar 
day after any study drug infusion or any event defined by the inves-
tigator as infusion-related. Disease activity, evaluated using the HBI 
score, was recorded at weeks 0, 4, 8 and 12, and every 8 weeks there-
after. A urine pregnancy test was performed and a PML symptom 
checklist was administered before dosing.
2.4. Evaluation of clinical efficacy and health-
related quality of life
GEMINI LTS was not primarily designed or powered to investigate 
specific efficacy-related hypotheses. Accordingly, the efficacy data 
are presented using descriptive statistical techniques. All available 
data for enrolled patients in the efficacy population are included. For 
all change from baseline assessments, baseline score was defined as 
week 0 of the study in which the patient first participated [i.e. before 
any study drug treatment].
Evaluation of clinical efficacy included assessment of serum CRP 
concentration, clinical response [≥3-point decrease from baseline in 
HBI score] and clinical remission [HBI score ≤4]. For the evaluation 
of serum CRP concentration, the mean change from baseline was 
reported; a lower, more negative change indicates improvement. The 
proportions of patients with response or remission were calculated 
in two ways: [1] as observed rates using the number of patients at the 
study visit as the denominator; or [2] with non-responder imputa-
tion using the number of enrolled patients as the denominator, based 
on the principle that patients with missing data were considered fail-
ures because of loss of response.
Patient-reported HRQL outcomes were evaluated using the 
Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire [IBDQ], European 
Quality of Life-5 Dimension [EQ-5D] visual analogue scale [VAS], 
and 36-item Short-Form Health Survey [SF-36] physical compo-
nent summary [PCS] and mental component summary [MCS] dur-
ing screening and at weeks 6, 30 and 52 during GEMINI 2, and 
week 28, every 24 weeks for the first 4 years, and yearly from year 
5 onward during GEMINI LTS. Improvements in HRQL measures 
were reported as the mean change from the baseline score; a higher, 
more positive change indicated improvement. Increases from base-
line score of ≥16 points for IBDQ,16 ≥3 points for SF-36 MCS and 
PCS,16 and ≥9 points for EQ-5D VAS are considered the minimums 
for clinically meaningful improvement.17
2.4.1. Populations studied in the efficacy analyses
For the purpose of this interim efficacy report, we focused on patients 
with moderately to severely active CD. Patients from C13004 were 
excluded from the analyses because that study included some 
patients with mild CD. The efficacy population comprised vedoli-
zumab-naïve, GEMINI 2 and GEMINI 3 patients who received at 
least one dose of vedolizumab in GEMINI LTS and had at least one 
post-baseline efficacy assessment analyzed. Data were summarized 
414 
S. Vermeire et al.

 from the first assessment in any study through GEMINI LTS accord-
ing to treatment in the prior study when applicable. Patients from 
GEMINI 2 who responded to vedolizumab induction therapy [VDZ] 
and were randomized to receive vedolizumab every 8 weeks [Q8W] 
or every 4 weeks [Q4W] or placebo [PBO] before open-label vedoli-
zumab every 4 weeks [Q4W] in GEMINI LTS were termed VDZ/
Q8W→Q4W, VDZ/Q4W→Q4W or VDZ/PBO→VDZ Q4W, 
respectively [Table 1]. Patients who completed GEMINI 2 and those 
who withdrew early formed pre-specified subgroups of the efficacy 
population.
Long-term efficacy was evaluated for patients who completed 
GEMINI 2 on the VDZ/Q8W→Q4W and VDZ/Q4W→Q4W 
treatment regimens. These patients continued vedolizumab after 
clinical response at week 6. Data for these patients were combined 
since both groups received vedolizumab Q4W during GEMINI LTS 
and since similar treatment outcomes were observed in GEMINI 
213 for the Q8W and Q4W maintenance dosing groups. Patients in 
the VDZ/PBO→VDZ Q4W group constituted an inherent retreat-
ment population in GEMINI LTS. That is, these patients experienced 
an interruption in therapy for up to 1 year when receiving placebo 
during GEMINI 2 maintenance after initially responding to ved-
olizumab induction. An increase in vedolizumab dosing frequency 
was analyzed in the VDZ/Q8W→Q4W population who responded 
to vedolizumab induction, but withdrew early from maintenance 
dosing every 8 weeks – for example because of a loss of response 
[Supplementary Table 1] – in GEMINI 2 before receiving vedoli-
zumab every 4 weeks in GEMINI LTS.
Patients who had prior TNF antagonist failure or those who were 
TNF antagonist-naïve formed subpopulations for efficacy assess-
ments. TNF antagonist failure was pre-specified on the case report 
form during baseline evaluation as patients who had an inadequate 
response, loss of response or intolerance to prior TNF antagonist 
therapy. Patients who were TNF antagonist-naïve were identified on 
the interactive voice response system during screening as those who 
had no prior exposure to a TNF antagonist. Given that some of the 
TNF antagonist-exposed patients were not recorded as having failed 
the drug, the sum of these two subcategories [failure and naïve] did 
not equal the total enrolled population.
2.5. Immunogenicity
The potential effect of immunogenicity on retreatment was exam-
ined in VDZ/PBO→VDZ Q4W patients by measuring serum 
anti-vedolizumab antibody [AVA] concentrations during the time 
off vedolizumab in the maintenance phase of GEMINI 2. The last 
dose of vedolizumab during GEMINI 2 for these patients was week 
2. Samples for AVA measurement were collected 30 min before dos-
ing during GEMINI 2 at weeks 0, 6, 14, 26, 38 and 52. AVAs were 
detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with a drug toler-
ance of 1 μg/ml.18 Patients with at least one positive AVA sample 
were classified as AVA positive.
3. Results
3.1. Patient disposition and vedolizumab exposure
In total, 1349 patients with CD enrolled in the GEMINI LTS study 
and constituted the safety population [Figure 1a]. The efficacy popu-
lation comprised 1297 patients with moderately to severely active 
CD – 700 from GEMINI 2, 372 from GEMINI 3 and 225 vedoli-
zumab-naïve patients [Figure 1]. Of the GEMINI 2 patients analyzed 
for efficacy, 391 completed the 52-week study and 309 withdrew 
early. All GEMINI 3 patients enrolled in GEMINI LTS had com-
pleted the 10-week study [Figure 1].
At the time of this interim data cut, the median duration of ved-
olizumab exposure was 616 days [range: 113–1964 days] in the 
safety population. Discontinuation had occurred in 42% [n=569] 
of the safety population; 20% had discontinued because of lack of 
efficacy. Within the efficacy population, treatment for 775 [60%] 
patients was still ongoing. At week 100, 428 patients [33%] were 
ongoing treatment, but had yet to reach that time point in GEMINI 
LTS or had missing data for that visit [Figure 1b].
Patient demographics and baseline disease characteristics are 
provided in Table 2 for the total enrolled CD population except for 
C13004 patients. Additional patient demographics and baseline dis-
ease characteristics are reported in Supplementary Table 2. At the 
time of entry into GEMINI LTS, the mean HBI score was 8.1 and 
over half of patients were receiving concomitant corticosteroids and/
or immunosuppressives. Patients who completed GEMINI 2 had a 
much lower baseline HBI score at entry into GEMINI LTS [4.5 ± 3.7] 
than those who withdrew early from the study [11.3 ± 5.7]. 
Subpopulations of patients with TNF antagonist failure [63%] or 
who were TNF antagonist-naïve [33%] demonstrated similar char-
acteristics to the overall population, except for disease duration and 
history of prior surgery [Table 2]. Patients with TNF antagonist fail-
ure had a mean disease duration of 11.6 years, whereas the TNF 
antagonist-naïve subpopulation had a shorter mean disease duration 
of 7.0 years. In addition, 49% of TNF antagonist-failure patients 
had a history of prior surgery versus 26% of TNF antagonist-naïve 
patients.
3.2. Safety
The interim GEMINI LTS safety profile as of June 27, 2013 [Table 3] 
was consistent with that previously reported in patients with CD.13,19 
The most common adverse events, occurring in ≥20% of patients, were 
exacerbation of CD, nasopharyngitis and arthralgia. Adverse events 
that resulted in study discontinuation occurred in 12% of GEMINI 
LTS patients. Serious adverse events were reported in 31% of patients, 
with serious infections occurring in 8% of patients. Infusion-related 
reactions occurred in 4% of patients. Six patients developed a malig-
nancy [one each of malignant lung neoplasm, colon cancer, basal cell 
carcinoma, B-cell lymphoma, squamous cell carcinoma and malignant 
hepatic neoplasm]. No cases of PML were reported.

 3.3. Long-term efficacy
Disease activity using the HBI score was analyzed for the evaluation 
of clinical efficacy [Figure 2]. For the vedolizumab-naïve popula-
tion, the percentage of patients with an HBI score of >7 was low-
ered from 99% [n=222/225] at study entry to 24% [n=40/164] 
after 28 weeks of treatment; 57% [n=94/164] of patients were in 
remission [Figure 2a]. Few vedolizumab-naïve patients [n=14] had 
reached 52 weeks of exposure at the time of the interim analysis 
[Figure 1b and Figure 2a]. Vedolizumab-naïve patients also experi-
enced improvements in HRQL after 28 weeks of treatment as meas-
ured by changes in IBDQ, EQ-5D VAS, SF-36 PCS and SF-36 MCS 
scores from baseline [Supplementary Table 3]. Among vedolizumab-
naïve patients who had previously failed a TNF antagonist or who 
were TNF antagonist-naïve, 49% [n=55/113] and 78% [n=35/45], 
respectively, were in remission after 28 weeks of vedolizumab treat-
ment [Supplementary Table 4].
Among patients who were previously exposed to vedolizumab 
in the GEMINI 2 and GEMINI 3 trials, a reduction in disease activ-
ity was sustained with long-term open-label vedolizumab therapy 
[Figure 2b and 2c]. After an additional 100 weeks [week 152] of 
treatment, 74% [n=156/212] of all patients who completed GEMINI 
2 were in remission [Figure 2b], including 66% [n=75/113] of those 
with prior TNF antagonist failure and 82% [n=69/84] of TNF-
antagonist naïve patients [Supplementary Table 4]. Improvements 
were similar among GEMINI 3 patients overall and among those 
with prior TNF antagonist failure or who were TNF antagonist-
naïve, with 69% [n=127/184], 67% [n=91/136] and 74% [n=34/46] 
in remission after a total exposure of 86 weeks, respectively [Figure 2c 
and Supplementary Table 4]. Few GEMINI 3 patients [n=38] had 
reached 110 weeks of exposure [Figure 1b and Figure 2c].
For further evaluation of long-term clinical efficacy, clinical 
response, remission, CRP concentration and HRQL were evaluated 
specifically for the subgroup of patients who received 152 weeks 
of continuous vedolizumab treatment. These patients responded to 
vedolizumab at week 6 of GEMINI 2 and completed maintenance 
dosing of vedolizumab every 8 or every 4 weeks before receiving 
open-label vedolizumab every 4 weeks during GEMINI LTS [VDZ/
Q8W→Q4W and VDZ/Q4W→Q4W populations combined]. The 
mean change from baseline HBI score and 95% confidence intervals 
for GEMINI 2 patients who continued vedolizumab treatment in 
GEMINI LTS are shown in Supplementary Tables 5–7. In contrast 
to the population represented in Figure 2b, the following analyses

 exclude both non-ITT treatment groups and the ITT population 
of patients who were randomized to placebo maintenance during 
GEMINI 2. Clinical response was reported in 94% [n=113/120] 
and 97% [n=68/70] of patients with data available after 104 and 
152 weeks of continuous vedolizumab treatment, respectively 
[Figure 3a]. Corresponding proportions of patients were in remission 
with 83% [n=100/120] at week 104 and 89% [n=62/70] at week 
152 [Figure 3b]. It should be noted that the patients who had discon-
tinued from the study were excluded in the analyses. Alternatively, 
when including all patients without data as treatment failures, rates 
of response after 104 and 152 weeks of vedolizumab treatment were 
78% [n=113/145] and 47% [n=68/145], respectively, and rates of 
remission were 69% [n=100/145] and 43% [n=62/145], respectively 
[Figure 3c and 3d]. Regardless of GEMINI 2 maintenance dosing 
group, similar results were observed among those who received ved-
olizumab every 8 weeks or every 4 weeks before initiating treatment 
in GEMINI LTS [Supplementary Figure 2]. Among patients with 
prior TNF antagonist failure and those who were TNF antagonist-
naïve, clinical response rates were similar to those observed with 
the total population [Figure 3a and 3c]. Rates of clinical remission 
were numerically higher in patients who were TNF antagonist-naïve 
[Figure 3b and 3d]
A reduction in CRP levels, measured by the mean change from 
baseline, among patients with available data was observed in the total 
and TNF antagonist subpopulations [Figure 4]. That is, the magni-
tude of improvement increased with longer exposure. Furthermore, 
HRQL scores achieved after maintenance therapy in GEMINI 2 
were sustained in GEMINI LTS. After 80 weeks of exposure – when 
HRQL was first assessed in GEMINI LTS – the mean changes from 
baseline HRQL scores were >51 for IBDQ, >23 for EQ-5D VAS, >9 
for SF-36 PCS and >10 for SF-36 MCS [Figure 5]. Smaller improve-
ments in IBDQ and SF-36 PCS scores were consistently observed 
for TNF antagonist-naïve patients than for patients with prior TNF 
antagonist failure [Figure 5a and 5c], probably because TNF antag-
onist-naïve patients had higher scores at baseline.
3.4. Efficacy following retreatment
Patients who responded to vedolizumab during GEMINI 2 induction 
and were randomized to placebo maintenance at week 6 formed an 
inherent retreatment population upon re-initiation of vedolizumab 
during GEMINI LTS [VDZ/PBO→VDZ Q4W]. These patients 
experienced up to 1 year of interrupted vedolizumab therapy 
[median duration, 285 days] during GEMINI 2 before retreatment 
in GEMINI LTS. For patients who withdrew early from GEMINI 
2 [n=59], response and remission rates improved upon retreat-
ment with vedolizumab to 56% [n=33/59] and 48% [n=28/59], 
respectively, at week 28 of GEMINI LTS (up from 42% [n=25/59] 
and 9% [n=5/59] at week 0 of GEMINI LTS) [Figure 6]. Similar 
improvements were observed among patients with TNF antagonist 
failure or who were TNF antagonist-naïve [Figure 6]. However, 
rates of response and remission were generally higher for patients 
who were TNF antagonist-naïve within the first year of retreatment 
[Figure 6]. Among VDZ/PBO→VDZ Q4W patients who completed 
the 46-week GEMINI 2 maintenance phase on placebo [n=60], re-
initiation of treatment resulted in 68% [n=41/60] of patients with 
response and 63% [n=38/60] in remission at week 52 of GEMINI 
LTS (vs 77% [n=46/60] and 53% [n=32/60] at week 0 of GEMINI 
LTS) [Supplementary Figure 3].
Since VDZ/PBO→VDZ Q4W patients were initially exposed to 
vedolizumab before experiencing up to 1 year of interrupted therapy, 
AVAs were analyzed in this population – in those who completed 
GEMINI 2 and those who withdrew early – during the GEMINI 
2 maintenance phase to examine the association between length of 
interruption of therapy and development of immunogenicity. When 
the duration of interrupted therapy was divided into quartiles, the 
percentage of patients who developed AVAs was consistent regard-
less of time off drug [Supplementary Table 8].
3.5. Effects of increased dosing frequency
The vedolizumab dosing frequency in patients who received 
vedolizumab every 8 weeks during GEMINI 2 maintenance was 
increased to vedolizumab every 4 weeks during GEMINI LTS 
[VDZ/Q8W→Q4W]. Within this subpopulation, patients who 
withdrew early from GEMINI 2 were analyzed to evaluate the 
efficacy of an increase in dosing frequency. Specifically, 57 patients 
[45%] receiving vedolizumab every 8 weeks during GEMINI 2 
withdrew from the study early because of sustained non-response, 
disease worsening or need for rescue medication before enroll-
ing in GEMINI LTS [Figure 1 and Supplementary Table 1]. When 
patients enrolled in GEMINI LTS, 39% [n=22/57] were in clinical 
response and 4% [n=2/57] were in remission. By week 28, these

 proportions had increased to 54% [n=31/57] and 23% [n=13/57], 
respectively [Figure 7]. Corresponding values at week 100 were 
35% [n=20/57] with clinical response and 19% [n=11/57] in 
clinical remission. A similar trend in efficacy was observed with 
increased dosing frequency regardless of prior TNF antagonist 
exposure [Figure 7].
4. Discussion
GEMINI LTS was designed to evaluate the long-term safety of 
vedolizumab in patients with IBD. However, it also allowed for 
exploratory analysis of long-term clinical efficacy because effi-
cacy information was systematically captured at each study visit. 
Although not powered or designed to assess efficacy endpoints, this 
study represents the largest cohort of CD patients treated with ved-
olizumab and provides valuable information regarding continuous 
exposure for up to 152 weeks [approximately 3 years], increased 
dosing frequency and interruption of treatment.
Until recently, long-term maintenance treatment options for 
patients with CD were limited to TNF antagonists and/or immuno-
suppressive agents. These approaches were hampered by concerns 
over waning efficacy, immunogenicity and unwanted and, sometimes 
serious, side effects, such as the development of opportunistic infec-
tions, non-melanoma skin cancers and lymphoma.1,2 Therefore, the 
need to evaluate therapies that are efficacious and well-tolerated 
remains. The results presented here demonstrate the durability of 
vedolizumab treatment in patients initially responding to vedoli-
zumab, including vedolizumab-naïve, TNF antagonist-naïve and 
TNF antagonist-experienced patients. These benefits included sus-
tainability of clinical response, clinical remission, long-term HRQL 
improvements and suppression of the inflammatory biomarker CRP.
After response at week 6, clinical remission was observed in 74% 
of 145 patients after 52 weeks of vedolizumab maintenance, with 
continued treatment resulting in 83% of 120 and 89% of 70 patients 
after 104 and 152 weeks, respectively. However, patients who had 
discontinued the study, for example because of lack of efficacy, were 
not included in this analysis. To address this limitation, response 
and remission rates were conservatively calculated with patients 
with missing data considered treatment failures: among the enrolled 
population, 71% of patients were in remission at week 52, 69% at 
week 104 and 43% at week 152. However, a limitation of this latter 
approach is that a large proportion of patients had not completed 
152 weeks of treatment at the time of this interim analysis and may 
have been misrepresented as treatment failures. Endoscopy was also 
not prospectively evaluated during the study, precluding evaluation 
of mucosal healing. Mucosal healing in CD patients treated with 
vedolizumab is currently being investigated in a large prospective 
multicentre study [ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT02425111], and results

 are expected in 2017. However, observed improvements in serum 
CRP concentration, a quantifiable measure of inflammation, and 
HRQL provide further evidence to support the long-term efficacy 
of vedolizumab.
In any chronic disease, patients may need to interrupt therapy for 
medical or non-medical reasons. The concern with interruption of 
therapy is the potential for the development of anti-drug antibodies 
and subsequent loss of response.20 The efficacy of vedolizumab upon 
retreatment was evaluated in patients who responded to vedolizumab 
induction in GEMINI 2 and received double-blind placebo mainte-
nance before re-initiation of vedolizumab in GEMINI LTS. Some of 
these patients lost response after switching to placebo and are included 
in the population who withdrew early from GEMINI 2, while oth-
ers appeared to do well while receiving placebo and completed the 
52-week GEMINI 2 study. During the period of time between vedoli-
zumab doses, while patients were receiving placebo, AVAs were detect-
able in a similar proportion of patients regardless of the duration of 
time since the last vedolizumab dose. It is possible that the relatively 
long terminal elimination half-life of vedolizumab [25 days]18 pro-
vides some protection from sensitization.21 We report that patients 
with up to 1 year of interrupted therapy [median duration 285 days] 
experienced clinical benefits following retreatment in GEMINI LTS. In

Long-term Vedolizumab for Crohn’s Disease

 particular, some patients who responded to vedolizumab and then lost 
response after stopping treatment were effectively ‘rescued’ by retreat-
ment in a well-tolerated and efficacious manner.
Of the GEMINI LTS population, 57 patients had terminated 
GEMINI 2 early because of sustained non-response, disease worsen-
ing or need for rescue medication despite a response to vedolizumab 
induction and maintenance dosing every 8 weeks. Compared with 
patients who completed GEMINI 2 [n=69], patients who withdrew 
early may hypothetically represent a population with more refrac-
tory disease. In general, these patients experienced improved clinical 
outcomes following an increase to every-4-week dosing, which were 
maintained with continued treatment. This observation suggests that 
the increase to an every-4-week dosing regimen may be useful as 
a ‘rescue’ treatment for some patients who lose response while on 
8-weekly dosing. Notably, pharmacokinetic data collected during 
GEMINI 2 previously showed that, within the every-8-week dosing 
group, patients who terminated early from GEMINI 2 had numeri-
cally lower predicted vedolizumab serum concentrations, based 
on population pharmacokinetic modelling, at week 52 [32.7 µg/l, 
range: 10.6–120.4] than those who completed GEMINI 2 [39.5 µg/l, 
range: 20.7–120.7]; the difference was not statistically significant.22 
Although administration of vedolizumab every 4 weeks is not a 
currently approved regimen in some countries,23 these results sug-
gest that a subset of patients may benefit from an increase in dosing 
frequency. This possibility requires evaluation in future adequately 
controlled trials.
Details of the interim safety data for GEMINI LTS have been pub-
lished in a separate safety summary.19 Overall, the safety profile of 
vedolizumab was consistent with what has been previously reported in 
the GEMINI 2 maintenance study.13 In both GEMINI 2 and GEMINI 
LTS, the most common adverse event was exacerbation of disease.13 
Serious adverse events were reported in 31% of patients, and seri-
ous infections, in particular, occurred in 8% of patients. Malignancy 
occurred infrequently with <1% of patients experiencing any cancer. 
Importantly, no cases of PML have been reported to date.19 Although 
post-marketing risk assessments are in progress to monitor the occur-
rence of enteric adverse events and PML, as well as long-term adverse 
events, the low risk of systemic infections in the present study and the 
absence of any PML cases to date are reassuring and help to support 
the gut-selective mechanism of action of vedolizumab.
In conclusion, this preliminary analysis of GEMINI LTS data 
shows that long-term vedolizumab treatment is efficacious for 
patients with moderately to severely active CD. This report repre-
sents the largest clinical data set for long-term exposure of vedoli-
zumab and highlights the use of vedolizumab in common real-world 
situations such as retreatment after an interruption of therapy, treat-
ment for patients with prior TNF antagonist failure and treatment 
for those who are biologic-naïve. Finally, patients who lose response 
during vedolizumab maintenance may benefit from an increase in 
dosing frequency; however, future, prospective studies are warranted 
to confirm the efficacy of such a strategy and to identify which 
patients might benefit.
