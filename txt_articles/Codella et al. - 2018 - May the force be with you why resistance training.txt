Abstract 
 
Physical activity, together with diet and pharmacological therapy, represents one of the three 
cornerstones in type 2 diabetes mellitus treatment and care. 
The terapeutic appeal of regular physical activity stems from: i) its non-pharmacological nature; ii) its 
beneficial effects on the metabolic risk factors associated with diabetes complications; iii) its low costs. 
Evidence accumulated in the last years suggests that aerobic training - endurance training - constitutes 
a safe modality of intervention, achievable and effective in diabetes treatment, whenever it is not 
limitated by comorbidities. Aerobic training exerts insulin-mimetic effects and has been shown to 
lower mortality risk too. Anaerobic, intense physical activity, such as that of strength or power sports 
disciplines, is not univocally recognized as safe and simple to realize, however it is important in 
stimulating energy and glucose metabolism. According to recent evidence, high intensity training may 
be prescribed even in the face of cardiovascular diseases, peripheral vascular disease, or osteoarthritis. 
Some studies have shown resistance training to be more efficient than aerobic exercise in improving 
glycemic control. 
This review explores the most up-to-date indications emerging from literature in support of the 
beneficial effects of strength stimulation and resistance training in patients with type 2 diabetes without 
complications.

1. Background | the ascertained need of exercise in the management of diabetes 
Diabetes mellitus represents a group of metabolism alterations characterized by chronic 
hyperglycemia due to defective secretion and/or insulin action, including abnormalities in fat- and 
protein metabolism. When the cause is a regulatory disorder of the immune system (autoimmunity), 
pancreas either produces low insulin, or insulin is not produced at all; that is type 1 diabetes mellitus 
(T1D), which comprises 95% of all pediatric cases. In type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D), the insulin action, 
i.e. the response of peripheral tissues to this hormone, is deficient within an insulin resistance context 
and/or inappropriate insulin secretion.  
Often, both problems coexist in the same patient aggravating the syndromic clinical picture. 
 Diabetes results therefore as a chronic-degenerative metabolic disease that has reached 
pandemic proportions, mainly because of the increasing incidence and prevalence of T2D. According 
to the International Federation of Diabetes (IDF, 2017), 425 millions of people suffer from diabetes in 
the world and these may rise to 629 million in 2045 [1]. About 95% of known cases of diabetes and 
virtually all the cases of unknown diabetes are classifiable as T2D. Approximately 5% of the known 
cases of diabetes are classifiable as T1D. 
Within this epidemiological perspective, diabetes emerges as one of the main metabolic 
diseases with substantial costs for the European and worldwide sanitary system. Prevention is one of 
the major international challenges and therapies can luckily leverage on two modificable risk factors: 
overnutrition (which leads to obesity) and physical inactivity. The major international medical agencies 
have claimed physical activity being fundamental against the diffusion of diabetes. According to 
American Diabetes Association (ADA) and American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM): “Physical 
exercise performs a primary role in the prevention and control of insulin-resistance, pre-diabetes, 
gestational diabetes mellitus, T2D and its complications” [2]. Physical exercise, infact, is capable to 
activate acutely glucose metabolism. Training programs ad hoc are effective on stimulate insulin action 
in the organism of insulin resistant patients in toto. Uncountable studies show how physical exercise 
increases glucose uptake at peripheral and systemic level, improves insulin sensitivity, and permits to 
positively ride the known hyperbolic curve of glucose tolerance [3]. While weight loss and 
improvement of insulin sensitivity have been positively associated to endurance training [2, 4, 5] owing 
to the insulin-mimetics effects of aerobic exercise in T2D-patients, strength exercise and muscular 
conditioning have been always debated with controversy, mostly in reference to the acute stressors 
  
3 
inducing an overload to vascular system, potentially already challenged by long-term hyperglycemic 
conditions. Recent literature, however, has confirmed the need to integrate training programs with 
force stimulation, in subjects with T2D, as addressed by several seminal studies – randomized 
controlled trials – whereby resistance training (RT) resulted to be beneficial under many aspects, even 
in a single-bout session [6]. 
 
2. Materials and Methods  
2.1 Literature search strategy 
A systematic literature search was carried out in the Cochrane Library and MEDLINE databases for 
studies published in English (1998 January to 2017 December) combining the terms “resistance 
training”, “type 2 diabetes”, “strength”, “force”. We examined reference lists in original articles, 
reviews, and trials. Study search was performed both electronically and by following up references 
quoted in relevant paper. Case reports were excluded. 
2.2 Study selection 
The articles were screened, extracted, and read. The relative findings were classified by: i) 
resistance training effects on glycemic control; ii) resistance training effects on insulin sensitivity; 
iii) resistance training effects on cardio-metabolic health, including body composition, in healthy, 
diabetic, and obese subjects; iv) resistance training effects compared to other modalities of training. 
Periods of data collections ranged from 1998 and 2017, obtaining outcomes mostly from human 
models. A synoptic table of the relevant studies analyzed is offered (Table 1). 
 
3. Benefits of resistance training 
Progressive resistance training (PRT) procures improvements in body composition 
mainly via an increase in lean body mass – that is the metabolic active mass capable to remove glucose 
from the blood stream, using the glucose substrate to produce energy. PRT has been shown to improve 
insulin resistance and glycemic control, with a reduction of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), an increase 
in muscle mass and/or reducing fat mass [7]. Importantly, these findings are even more impressive 
when considering that similar reduction of HbA1c was found only in combined pharmacological 
therapies; in particular when a sulphonylurea (secretagogue) was added to metformin (biguanide). 
Aerobic activity hardly brings to such increase of lean body mass, and often its practice results 
  
4 
incompatible with several common clinical conditions of people with T2D, aggravated by 
comorbidities such as obesity, ostearthritis, peripheral vascular disorders and other physical disabilities. 
Paradoxically, in case of these comorbidities, exercise intensity becomes an issue in performing aerobic 
exercise (AE) far more than resistance training. For these subjects, 20-30-minute walking can be 
difficult, harsh, or even painful [8]. In contrast, lifting small weights and anaerobic muscle stimulation, 
can appear as a valid alternative, leading to metabolic gains that are essential in the management of 
T2D. 
Summarizing, the major benefits documented with resistance training in subjects with 
T2D are: i) increase of insulin sensitivity and glycemic control [9–11]; ii) improvement of blood 
cholesterol profiles [12]; iii) blood pressure decrease [13]; iv) improvement of cardiac performance; v) 
increase in strength and muscular power [14, 15]; vi) increase of lean body mass [16]; vii) increase in 
bone mineral density (with preventive effect on sarcopenia and osteoporosis) [17, 18]; viii) increase of 
daily energy expenditure  [19, 20] and ix) quality of life  [21]. 
Nevertheless, differently from aerobic activity (e.g. walking), resistance exercises can 
require a competent, skilled supervision,  the proper execution of training techniques, and handling 
with a specific equipment. 
In this perspective, it is desirable that resistance training becomes a concrete way, 
valuable, feasible and economic, in order to successfully train subjects with T2D. On the other hand, 
training studies are highly advocated to demonstrate the efficacy of these modalities of intervention, 
focusing on uncertain factors like intensity and genetic variability for training responsiveness. The 
ultimate goal would be, for istance, to regulate glucose homeostasis favorably. 
Future research strategies and -areas should be implemented for an increasingly high 
number of RT-practioners, giving the great potential of physical activity against the epidemic rising of 
chronic diseases associated with sedentarism. 
 
4. International guidelines: recommendations  
Over 60% of diabetic people do not practice regular physical activity [22]. ADA 
recommended to subjects with type 2 diabetes at least 150 minutes per week of moderate aerobic 
activity, or 90 minutes per week of relevant intensity aerobic activity [23] (Table 2). The Exercise and 
Sport Science Australia (ESSA) increased previous goals to 210 minutes per week of moderate activity 
  
5 
or 125 minutes per week of strenuous activity, inclusive of 2 or more resistance training sessions [24]. 
Unfortunately, only 28% of subjects with T2D meet ADA recommendations [25]. Despite a lifestyle 
modification of such small entity would significantly impact on cardiometabolic health of the 
population, unfortunately it is unreal that sedentary subjects would be able to respect these guidelines. 
Thus it becomes urgent to conceive a training modality practicable for people with T2D.   
The ADA and ACSM joint position stand encourages diabetic people to perform 
resistance training 2-3 times per week, in non-consecutive days, focusing on all major (eight) muscle 
groups [26]. Patients should perform from 5 to 10 exercises including squat, push-up, abdominals, lifts 
on the ankles, so that all the principal muscle groups would be involved. The ACSM calls to execute 2-
3 sets per exercise, from 8-10 repetitions each, with a reasonable workload (75-80% of one repetition 
maximum, 1RM). Sessions should be anticipated by 5 minutes of warm up, as well as should be 
followed by a final step of cool down at lower intensity. Untrained subjects could span the work during 
the day in multiple sessions of shorter duration, in order to reach the predetermined goal with lower 
fatigue. As to this latter, it would be useful to monitor and quantify the perceived effort with a Borg 
scale (Borg Rate of Perceived Exertion) [27].  Several devices are also available to manage the 
cardiovascular intensity, ranging from modern heart rate monitors to smartphone applications, to 
theoretical algorithms (maximum heart rate, HRM: 220-age). Moderate intensity should be set as 50-70% 
HRM, while vigorous intensity between 70 and 85% HRM [28]. Obviously, subjects with known 
cardiovascular problems, autonomic neuropathy, or under beta-blocker regimen, should cautiously 
modulate and regulate training intensity on pre-determined cardiovascular parameters.  Abstaining is 
reasonable as well as consulting a specialist. An ad hoc visit with diabetologist or sports physician for 
anamnesis, physical examination and functional evaluation (resting- and exercise electrocardiogram, 
ECG-test) are therefore strongly recommended before engaging in any physical activity practice [26]. 
 
5. Study outcomes and molecular mechanisms 
In sedentary adults, muscle mass and strenght decrease progressively with age, 
particularly after age of 45, with a more pronounced reduction following 60-year age [29, 30]. Skeletal 
muscle tissue – being the first site for glucose and triglycerides disposal – decreases by 3-8% every 
decade after the age of 30 [31], increasing the risk of glucose intolerance and T2D pathogenesis, 
considerably [32]. Diabetes is a independent risk factor for the low muscular strenght [33], and subjects 
  
6 
with T2D in old age show an accelerated decline of strength and muscle mass compared to non-
diabetic peers [34, 35]. Epidemiological studies confirm the inverse correlation between muscle 
strength and metabolic syndrome, and between muscular strength and all-cause mortality [36]. The 
deleterious loss in lean mass and muscular strength associated with aging can be exacerbated, in a 
vicious circle, by progressive physical inactivity. Carrying out activities of daily living (physical 
independence) and simple motor tasks become harsh, especially for elderly. The muscle of a subject 
with T2D may be threathened by insulin resistance, impaired glycogenesis, mitochondrial dysfunction 
and lipid accumulation [37]. As said, aging per se, is responsible of lean mass loss, however metabolic 
and functional disorders can be definitely hindered with strength exercises [38]. A widespread body of 
evidence points at RT to obtain positive physiological adaptations and unique benefits in T2D. 
In the Health Professional Follow-up Study [39], which monitored more than 32,000 
subjects over 18 years, those who trained with RT for more than 150 minutes per week showed a 34% 
reduction in risk of T2D (normalized for BMI and aerobic activities) [40]. The protection offered by 
physical activity against T2D increased up to 60% when the analysis included obese people (BMI≥30) 
performing RT with ≥ 150 min/week [40]. 
Resistance training can represent an excellent adjuvant in T2D prevention and 
management by decreasing visceral fat and inflammatory markers [41]. Three months of RT in obese 
teenagers determined a significant reduction of total and visceral fat, accompanied by an increase of 
insulin sensitivity compared with nonexercising controls [42]. Some studies have also demonstrated 
how RTs are effective in reducing abdominal fat in subjects with T2D, even without a weight loss [43]. 
In the study of Honkola et al. [12], 5 months of PRT in circuit were capable to significantly reduce 
LDL cholesterol and fasting triglycerides, compared to the control group.  
Unanimously, HbA1c is accepted as the most indicative parameter for measuring long-
term glycemic control, and is strongly associated with diabetes risk, cardiovascular disease and 
mortality [44]. RT can improve insulin action and glycemic control in subjects with T2D. In a meta-
analysis, Umpierre et al. [45] have reported a reduction of 0.67% in Hb1Ac levels in T2D-subjects 
undergone to 12-week RT compared to sedentary controls. In another meta-analysis comprising 10 
supervised studies, HbA1c decreased by 0.48% with RT [46]. Most individuals are able to better 
control their blood glucose levels and body weight [47] via RT-induced increase in lean body mass and 
insulin-sensibility. In particular, RT prevents lean body mass loss in those aiming at weight loss with 
  
7 
caloric restriction [38]. Insulin-sensitivity and glycemic control can be improved with RT owing to 
diversified adaptations. The first of these entails the increase of level, density and translocation of 
glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) receptors [48]. Likewise, the protein expression of insulin receptors is 
increased, with a consequent insulin-sensitizing effect of the training. The improved insulin action is 
evidenced by the growth in protein-kinase B-α/β content. As an acute training effect, the glucose 
disposal (glucose clearance) was found accelerated in the leg trained with 6 weeks of RT compared to 
the nonexercising leg, paralleled by an increase of whole activity and concentration of glycogen-
synthetase. In another study [49], 16 weeks of supervised, high-intensity, PRT, 3 times per week, 
increased muscle glycogen storage by 31% in old subjects with T2D, while controls reported a 
significance decrease in glycogen content (-23%). The PRT-trained group , moreover, reported a 
decrease of HbA1c from 8.7% to 7.6%. Increasing muscle mass in conjunction with reducing HbA1c 
would support the hypothesis according which RTs improve glycemic control by increasing muscle 
glucose storage [49]. On a singular note, prescribed diabetic medications were reduced in 72% of the 
subjects in the PRT group compared with the control group [49]. 
RT can improve glucose transport in normal and insulin-resistant skeletal muscle by 
activation of the insulin signal pathway [50]. Peculiarly, these RT-induced modifications can improve 
metabolic profile of skeletal muscle, independently from the increase in lean mass [51]. 
In one of the first randomized-controlled-trial, weight lifting at moderate intensity in a 
circuit training (3 times/week, 55% 1RM per 8 weeks) showed a decreased insulin response during an 
oral glucose tolerance test in diabetic patients with respect to controls at rest [52]. During an 
hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp, the glucose disposal was increased by 48% in T2D-subjects 
trained with 4-6 weeks of moderate-intensity RT, compared to controls, at rest [53]. 
Recently, Bacchi et al. [54] showed how 4 months of RT and aerobic training were both 
effective to improve liver fat storage, insulin-sensibility, total fat mass and HbA1c in adults with T2D 
and non-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease (NAFLD). Ideally, endurance/aerobic training and RT should be 
combined in order to increase the benefits for subjects with T2D and prediabetes [55]. Positive effects 
of combined training in subjects with T2D have been demonstrated in several well-sized trials. In the 
HART-D trial [38], 262 patients with T2D were randomized to 4 training groups (aerobic, RT, 
combinated, control) per 3 weekly sessions with the same energy expenditure (12kcal/kg/week): the 
best glycemic control was obtained in the combined training group, with an absolute reduction of 0.34% 
  
8 
in HbA1c compared to the other groups. The same design was used in the DARE trial [56] with 251 
patients randomized in 4 groups: the best glycemic control was obtained in the combined training 
group (-0.97% Hb1Ac vs control). Yet in the DARE trial, the RT group showed futher improvements 
in mental health, vitality and quality-of-life compared to the aerobic-only or control groups. In the 
IDES Italian study [13], 606 patients with T2D from 22 centers (40-75 years old, HbA1c average levels 
equal to 7.13%) were randomized to 2 intervention groups: the first group trained in the gym with 
combined program twice a week with personal trainers’ supervision; the second group, as control, self-
trained, following a non-supervised program. As a result, the first group observed improvements in all 
profiles: aerobic fitness, strength, blood pressure, waist circumference, lipids, inflammatory markers, 
and cardiovascular risk. 
The study of Sparks et al. [57] represents the first clear demonstration that RT induces an 
increase in mitochondrial content in the skeletal muscle of T2D-patients trained for 9 months. These 
adaptations were also associated to other clinical improvements referred to functional performance 
(VO2max) and glycemic control (HbA1c). The other subjects of the same study were randomized to the 
aerobic training group, combined, or to nonexercising controls. The combined training group improved, 
amongst others, all the markers of long- and medium-chain fatty acid oxidation, increased tricarboxylic 
acid (TCA) cycle flux, as well as mitochondrial content and enzymatic activity. Overall, a number of 
studies have confirmed a synergistic, addictive effect of combined training (RT + AE) on glycemic 
control (up to -1.5% in HbA1c) [58], insulin action, exercise tolerance and muscular capacity, in the 
long term. 
RT augments excess oxygen delivery post-training (EPOC, Excess Postexercise Oxygen 
Consumption) [59]. This increase in oxygen uptake (VO2), following a RT session is consistent with 
the energy expenditure rise in the recovery period. EPOC suggests an accelerated fat metabolism, 
which is determinant for weight loss. EPOC seems to be higher in RT compared to aerobic training 
[60]. Anyway, the increase of energy expenditure, either depending on EPOC or RT, is of pivotal 
importance to initiate an overall healthful metabolism. 
Hereby the macro-molecular steps describing major phenomena induced by RT: 
 
 
 
  
9 
5.1 Hypertrophy 
One of the main metabolic pathways responsible for muscle hypertrophy through the increased 
protein synthesis would be the IGF-1 / PI3K / AKT pathway. AKT stimulates protein synthesis by 
the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) [61]. In addition to the increase of the skeletal muscle 
transverse section and muscular mass, RT induces also a shift in the muscle fibers composition. 
From a histochemical standpoint, RTs would switch 2x fibers with low oxidative capacity to type 
2a fibers, with a moderate oxidative capacity, these latter surely resulting more insulin-sensitive 
compared to the former ones [62] (Figure 2). Altogether, these adaptations result in enhanced 
skeletal muscle quantity, -quality (the amount of muscular strength/torque per unit of regional 
muscle mass), and -function, i.e. muscle strength and power, and motor unit recruitment. 
 
5.2 Metabolic control: glycemic control & insulin sensitivity 
There are several adaptations through which regular RT may improve overall glycemic control 
(possibly even more than what aerobic exercise can do) and insulin sensitivity: other than 
increasing GLUT4 levels, RT can augment protein kinase B, insulin receptors, muscle glycogen 
stores, glycogen synthase, and glycogen synthase total activity following acute training [48]. 
Recently, it was demonstrated that RT increased glycemic control in part by enhancing 
microvascular blood flow and substrate delivery to myocytes [63]. 
Although an enhancement in insulin action is usually related to greater skeletal muscle mass, 
insulin sensitivity may increase due to RT-procured qualititative changes, regardless of muscle 
mass gains. For istance, calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is stimulated in a 
exercise-intensity fashion, and it phosphorylates transcription factors like histone deacetylases 
(HDACs), which in turn leads to activation of transcription factors such as myocyte enhancing 
factor 2 (MEF2) and its target genes (PGC-1α, GLUT4) thus ameliorating glycemic control. 
In a meta-analysis [64], intensity resulted to be more important than duration in enhancing insulin 
sensitivity. However conclusive results are still lacking about the RT-effects of different 
durations/intensities on muscle mass. 
 
 
 
  10 
5.2.1 Glucose Clearance 
Non-oxidative glucose disposal occurs as RT stimulates glycogen synthesis through AKT-mediated 
glycogen synthase activity. Specifically, RT activates AKT, which, in turn, can inhibit glycogen 
synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β). Inhibition of GSK3 promotes stimulation of glycogen synthase, 
therefore leading to the production of glycogen.  
It has also been observed an increased activity of AMPK as an acute phenotypic response to RT 
[65]. This activation inhibits mTOR signal that impedes protein synthesis during resistance training. 
Transient AMPK activation can induce phosphorylation of target proteins involved in several 
metabolic pathways. Ultimately this can increase ATP production with a higher glucose uptake due 
to an intensified GLUT4 translocation or lipid oxidation [66]. RT may lead to other adaptations 
with insulin-mimetics effects: increased fatty acid metabolism (metabolic flexibility) [67] or 
augmented protein expression of insulin receptors in response to exercise [48]. 
 
5.3 Mitochondrial capacity 
Mitochondrial dysfunction has been associated to aging and insulin resistance. Subjects with T2D 
have lowered mitochondrial oxidative capacity, with disrupted mitochondrial morphology a 
reduction in mitochondrial size. However skeletal muscle oxidative capacity may be preserved in 
elderly as in young people, by performing regular, intense physical activity. Limited studies 
demonstrated the capability of RT in increasing mitochondrial oxidative capacity in healthy 
individuals. In the study of Sparks et al. [57], a 9-month RT program led to an increase in 
mitochondrial content in the skeletal muscle of T2D patients. Pesta et al. showed that lean subjects 
had the same increase in mitochondrial respiration in skeletal muscle, following either 10-week RT 
or AE [68]. 
Aging per se leads to sarcopenic alterations of the skeletal muscle, nevertheless physical activity, 
and especially RT, can help maintain mito-functional and metabolic properties (oxidative) of the 
muscular tissue. 
 
6. Which types of resistance training? 
RT, as a synonymous of strength training, refers to using muscular contraction to move a 
load (including a natural one, like one’s own body weight), to win a physical resistance: the most 
  11 
common use of opposing muscle contraction – to resist – is against gravity, elastic or hydraulic forces. 
RT consists therefore in brief repetitive exercises with free weights (dumbells and barbells), weight 
machines, resistance bands, isometric exercises, calistheniscs mobilizing one's own body weight (e.g. 
pushups) to increase muscle strength and/or muscle endurance. 
Performing whatever form of RT is important in T2D not only because of the 
aforementioned health benefits, but also because diabetic subjects are likely to be overweight or obese 
and therefore they are harshly able to fulfill the recommended doses of “effective” aerobic exercise. 
Short and intense RT exercises, repeated manifold throughout the day, should be more feasible and 
similiarly beneficial for these individuals. In the study of Hamasaki et al. [69], 12 weeks of low-
intensity RT with slow movement and tonic force generation decreased body fat mass and body fat 
percentage in 50-years old obese subjects with T2D. In addition, muscle mass resulted increased as 
well ass lipidemic profiles ameliorated. Decreases in fat mass of 1-4.5 kg were achieved with RT while 
AE can lower fat mass of a couple of kilograms, in a typical training program. Diminishing visceral 
adipose tissue is critical considering the associated chronic low-grade inflammation and 
cardiometabolic risks. RT appears most beneficial if performed in the long run, at high intensity. 
However, together with frequency and duration, this is still a matter of debate. In fact, a clear-cut dose 
dependency is undefined in the increasingly growing body of literature. In the discussed RT programs 
in T2D, a duration ≥ of 12 weeks, along with an estimated intensity ranging from 60-80% of 1RM, 
were shown sufficient to gain a 10-20% improvement in muscle mass, insulin sensitivity, body 
composition, cardiovascular health. Typically these studies concern RT carried out with weight 
machines, free weights, and they cannot be generalized to other types of RT, such as resistance bands 
or exercises utilizing only one's own body weight. For these reasons, tailored RT programs, 
considering individual crucial factors (level of strength – or 1RM; BMI, physical fitness, severity of 
diabetes, medications, comorbidities etc), are urgently needed. 
Supervision of expert personnel (diabetologists, health-care providers, fitness 
profesionals), within an omnicomprehensive educational approach, may represent a successful 
intervention strategy. Supervised exercise was shown to be more effective than self-reported physical 
acitivity in the compliance of the programs. Qualified trainers, by means of skilled competences and 
high-quality counseling, can exert a tremendous impact on these health measures, boosting the 
potential of RT while minimizing the risks of adverse effects. 
  12 
In conclusion, investigating the minimum effective dose of beneficial, customized RTs, 
is the key for the long-term adherence of individuals with T2D (and/or obesity), and for most of the 
people too.  
 
7. Therapies combining resistance training and anti-diabetic medications 
A complex variety of factors must be medically addressed when prescribing RT in 
patients with T2D or pre-diabetes: severity of diabetes, duration of the disease, presence of 
comorbidities, regimens of multiple oral hypoglycemic agents and differently-acting insulins, intensity 
of strenght training. High intensity efforts may cause a robust depletion of muscle glycogen, therefore 
exposing patients to the risk of late-onset hypoglycemia, especially under poorly controlled 
circumstances. Nevertheless, intermittent high-intensity exercise was preferred over continuos 
moderate intensity AE in order to reduce glycemic excursions post-effort [70]. Blood glucose levels 
should be carefully managed prior to the initiation of any type of exercise training. Likewise, time of 
medications and meals ought be properly adjusted for a safe and effective RT participation. 
Metformin, one of the most prescribed biguanide – the first-line oral anti-hyperglycemic 
medication recommended by ADA – has been shown to have pleiotropic effects similar to exercise. In 
fact, they both independently activate AMPK, therefore increasing insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. It 
is worth noting that the magnitude of the RT-effect on HbA1c reduction (-0.34% ≤ x ≤ -0.57%) [45, 71] 
is averagely inferior than the one procured by metformin (-0.97%) [71] or acarbose (-0.77%) [72]. 
These observations led to hypothesis that combining metformin with exercise would have synergistic 
effects on insulin sensitivity. On the contrary, according to certain studies, metformin plus exercise did 
not show addictive effects with respect to exercise alone in improving insulin sensitivity or HbA1c, in 
both nondiabetic and T2D individuals [73]. Yet, an extent exists, although unknown, by which 
metformin alters the beneficial effects of exercise in lowering CVD risk in diabetic people. It is 
possible that metformin triggers distinct adaptations within pancreatic beta cells and, primarily, in the 
liver. Conversely, metformin plus exercise seem to have addictive effects when weight loss is the 
outcome considered. Literature findings remain inconsistent and they need to be pursued sistematically. 
Besides, the majority of these studies have covered endurance training, which may rely much more on 
the AMPK signaling pathway than RT.  
  13 
Another possible explanation is that ROS generation during exercise is a signal for the 
enhancement of insulin action [73]. Metformin opposes ROS signaling, thus blunting, to some extent, 
the beneficial adaptations procured by exercise (mitochondrial biogenesis, endothelial function, 
glucose uptake). 
Hence, a doubly positive action coming from the proposition of exercise in conjunction 
with other compounds (either a drug or an antioxidant/ergogenic/dietary supplement) should be 
cautiously inferred. 
Structured research should test diversified RT-intensities and -duration in the context of 
controlled diet & medications. The ultimate goal of combined strategies would be to maximize the 
metabolic health responses, on a personalized level. 
 
8.  Comprehensive educational programs in the management and care of patients with T2D 
RT-prescriptions alone are insufficient to modify, on the long-term, the lifestyles of 
people living with T2D, especially if worsened by overweight and obesity. Barriers do exist for these 
subjects to comply with structured exercise: these individuals are generally unaccustomed to exercise, 
with a relevant history of sedentary behavior [74]. Therefore exercise recommendations need to be 
personalized on the actual subjects’ capabilities. Besides, in order to maximize the exercise-benefits, 
recommendations should be incorporated into comprehensive educational programs, including 
multifactorial behavioral interventions. The glycemic benefits of RT can be, in fact, quite modest (an 
approximate decline in HbA1c of 0.5%), thus exercise cannot represent the sole “advocated” 
intervention, but it should be an adjunctive to both nutritional and medical therapies. Futhermore, when 
the disease is exacerbated by complications, a therapeutic patient education (TPE) is urgently needed in 
order to crucially prevent and reduce fatal events (mostly because of cardiovascular events) [75, 76] 
and the overall disability-free life expectancy. These education programs can have a greater effect on 
disability-free years than total life expectancy, among adults with diabetes [77]. A TPE entails all 
necessary skills a patient may need to cope with a chronic disease [75]. Several structured TPE 
programs have been outlined in the management of diabetes. Diabetes self-management education 
(DMSE) embraces peculiar themes concerning basic knowledge on diabetes, physical activity, diet, 
diabetic medications, self-care and decision making while living with the disease [78–80]. These 
programs have been shown to be fundamental not only in the management of diabetes, but also in the 
  14 
prevention to develop it, or to develop its complications. In fact, complications are approximately four 
times more frequent in diabetic people with no education respect to patients exposed to educational 
programs [81]. When TPEs are delivered at individual level, the effects are greater in improving 
diabetes knowledge, metabolic parameters and quality of life with respect to group-TPE [82]. Again, 
all these aspects, as essential part of DSME – from medical nutrition therapy to exercise precriptions – 
are more effective when they are “personalized”, in accordance with the economic and cultural status 
of the individuals [2]. 
Event in the management of T1D, omni-comprehensive programs are capable to 
optimize and maintain positive metabolic outcomes, also assisted by telemedicine and diversified tele-
healthcare systems [74, 83, 84]. 
In summary, a multifaceted educational plan is highly warranted in diabetic people, 
firstly to acquire an adequate knowledge on various diabetes themes, and ultimately to gain a greater 
potential from active lifestyles, improving metabolic and psychosocial outcomes, and therefore 
reducing disability, morbidity and mortality.  
 
8. Conclusive comments 
RT can improve glucose tolerance and insulin-sensitivity by qualitative modifications 
independently of the muscle mass increase. It is well known, however, that insulin sensitivity is 
directly proportional to lean body mass. The increase of lean mass remains, therefore, a reasonable goal 
for T2D-subjects performing RT: this increase is de facto accompanied by an enhancement of basal 
metabolism triggering a virtuous cycle (of metabolic health). 
It is a vivid interest to consider strength stimulation among the diverse modalities of 
training doable by T2D-subjects. In today’s society, so committed in multiplying chances of being 
physically active, short-repeated exercise is a viable alternative to the traditional high-volume 
endurance training. High intensity/low volume RTs can be efficient strategies to obtain metabolic 
benefits. The beneficial effects of RT are achievable not only by T2D-subjects, but also by a large part 
of society, maintaining a musculoskeletal health, independence in daily living activities, therefore 
reducing injury risks and the deleterious effects of aging (sarcopenia).
