ABSTRACT
Context: Ketamine is an emerging drug for the treatment of acute undifferentiated agitation in the pre-
hospital environment, however no prospective comparative studies have evaluated its effectiveness or
safety in this clinical setting. Objective: We hypothesized 5 mg/kg of intramuscular ketamine would be
superior to 10 mg of intramuscular haloperidol for severe prehospital agitation, with time to adequate
sedation as the primary outcome measure. Methods: This was a prospective open label study of all
patients in an urban EMS system requiring chemical sedation for severe acute undifferentiated agitation
that were subsequently transported to the EMS system’s primary Emergency Department. All paramed-
ics were trained in the Altered Mental Status Scale and prospectively recorded agitation scores on all
patients. Two 6-month periods where either ketamine or haloperidol was the first-line therapy for
severe agitation were prospectively compared primarily for time to adequate sedation. Secondary out-
comes included laboratory data and adverse medication events. Results: 146 subjects were enrolled; 64
received ketamine, 82 received haloperidol. Median time to adequate sedation for the ketamine group
was 5 minutes (range 0.4–23) vs. 17 minutes (range 2–84) in the haloperidol group (difference
12 minutes, 95% CI 9–15). Complications occurred in 49% (27/55) of patients receiving ketamine vs. 5%
(4/82) in the haloperidol group. Complications specific to the ketamine group included hypersalivation
(21/56, 38%), emergence reaction (5/52, 10%), vomiting (5/57, 9%), and laryngospasm (3/55, 5%).
Intubation was also significantly higher in the ketamine group; 39% of patients receiving ketamine were
intubated vs. 4% of patients receiving haloperidol. Conclusions: Ketamine is superior to haloperidol in
terms of time to adequate sedation for severe prehospital acute undifferentiated agitation, but is associ-
ated with more complications and a higher intubation rate.

Introduction
Acute undifferentiated agitation is a commonly encoun-
tered
problem
in
the
prehospital
environment
[1]
that
represents risk for both the patient and caregivers. Data
suggest over one third of Emergency Medical Technician
(EMT) occupational injuries are patient related,[2] and for
patients,
severe
agitation
can
culminate
in
profound
metabolic
abnormalities
and
even
death.[3]
Drug
and
alcohol intoxication is common in this patient population;
one study found the presence of alcohol or intoxicating
drugs
to
be
in
excess
of
80%
in
these
patients.[4]
Chemical sedation has been shown to reduce agitation
in
the
prehospital
environment,[5],
though
the
optimal
agent has not been agreed upon. Traditional pharmaco-
logic treatment of acute undifferentiated agitation in the
prehospital
environment
has
included
butyrophenones
such as droperidol and haloperidol [6–8] as well as ben-
zodiazepines,
typically
midazolam.[4]
Due
to
its
rapid
onset of action, tendency to preserve airway reflexes,[9]
and
reported
wide
therapeutic
index,[10]
ketamine
has
emerged as a promising therapy for acute undifferenti-
ated
agitation
in
the
prehospital
environment.
Data
describing
its
use
however,
are
limited
to
case
reports,[11,12]
and
case
series.[13–15]
Prospective
com-
parative data on the use of ketamine for this indication
is lacking.
The primary objective of this study was to determine if
haloperidol or ketamine was superior for the treatment of
severe
prehospital
acute
undifferentiated
agitation.
Specifically, we hypothesized that in patients with severe agi-
tation presenting to our EMS system, 5 mg/kg of intramuscu-
lar
(IM)
ketamine
would
be
superior
to
10 mg
of
IM
haloperidol, with time to adequate sedation as our primary
outcome measure. Secondary outcomes included need for re-
dosing in the prehospital environment, the rate of adverse
side effects, and rates of intubation between ketamine and
haloperidol. Lastly, we investigated if this patient population
could be feasibly consented to allow randomization in future
studies.

 Methods
Study design and setting
This was a Waiver of Consent (45 CFR 46.116) [16] prospective
observational study of patients with severe acute undifferenti-
ated agitation within the EMS primary service area subse-
quently
transported
to
the
study
hospital’s
Emergency
Department (ED). This study was conducted at an urban Level
1 trauma center safety-net hospital with more than 110,000
annual ED visits starting with calls to its hospital-based EMS
agency. The EMS agency responds to over 70,000 calls annu-
ally, serving an urban and suburban population of over
1,000,000 covering over 200 square miles. Approximately 500
patients per year receive chemical sedation by standing order
protocol for ‘‘severe agitation.’’ For the purpose of this study,
‘‘severe agitation’’ was defined as an Altered Mental Status
Scale (AMSS) score of þ2 or þ3 (Table 1). All ambulances
were staffed with two EMT-paramedics at all times. Mean
scene time for the agency is 17.9 minutes; mean transport
time is 12.2 minutes. All caregivers, both prehospital and in
the ED, were unblinded to which medication the patients
received.
Selection of participants
All patients in the EMS system with severe acute undifferenti-
ated agitation subsequently transported to the study hospital
were included in the study. Even in the instance where the eti-
ology of the agitation was suspected, such as history of drug
intoxication or overdose, patients were still included as diag-
nostic certainty was not possible in the prehospital environ-
ment. Exclusion criteria included obviously gravid women,
persons who appeared or were known to be less than 18 years
of age, and patients with ‘‘profound agitation,’’ defined as an
AMSS score of þ4. Based on over 10 years of experience suc-
cessfully treating profoundly agitated patients with keta-
mine,[17,18] our institution deemed it unethical and unwise to
withhold ketamine from the most profoundly agitated patients
at any time for both patient and caregiver safety.
Though this study was approved by the institutional IRB as
a Waiver of Consent study, given the particularly vulnerable
nature of this patient population a community consultation
was performed in accordance with federal guidelines for
Exception From Informed Consent (21 CFR 50.24) research.[19]
Both the caregivers affected by this study as well as a select
group of patients at a local homeless shelter’s inpatient
chemical dependency program were consulted. Details of the
community consultation are available upon request.
Interventions
To minimize potential bias introduced by seasonal changes,
data were collected throughout an entire calendar year. For
the first three months of the study (October 2014–January
2015), the standard EMS operating procedure (SOP) for
severely agitated patients was to treat acute undifferentiated
agitation with 10 mg of IM haloperidol. For the next 6
months, haloperidol was removed from all ambulances in the
system and the SOP for severely agitated patients was
changed to 5 mg/kg of IM ketamine (dose calculation made
by EMT-paramedic estimated weight in the field). For the final
3 months of the study, the SOP was returned to haloperidol
10 mg IM and haloperidol was reinstated on the ambulances.
Doses for both drugs were chosen based on existing SOPs
that had been in place since 2010. The ketamine dose was
originally chosen based on procedural sedation dosing. A
dose of 5 mg/kg was chosen because a lower dose, such as
3 mg/kg, may result in a partially dissociated state which
would put both the patient and paramedics in further danger.
Furthermore, the existing literature on ketamine advocates
adverse events are not dose-dependent,[8,9] suggesting a
higher dose poses little, if any, risk to the patient.
Methods and measurements
All paramedics were trained in the AMSS,[20] a validated
score of agitation routinely used in agitation research at the
study institution. Training was completed both online and at
in-person training sessions led by the primary investigator. All
paramedics were required to pass a quiz containing example
patients where a correct AMSS score must be assigned. Upon
encountering a patient with severe agitation requiring chem-
ical sedation, paramedics activated a stopwatch immediately
after injection of the sedative. Patients were excluded if stop-
watch activation did not occur. AMSS scores were recorded
every 5 minutes, or until adequate sedation was reached.
Adequate sedation was defined clinically by the treating para-
medic; however during training it was emphasized that
adequate treatment of agitation would be an AMSS score-
< þ1. Paramedics were specifically instructed to stop the
stopwatch prior to 5 minutes if the patient appeared to have
reached adequate sedation. Paramedics also recorded pro-
spectively if a legally authorized representative was present at
the scene to give consent.
Immediately upon arrival to the ED, paramedics transferred
both the stopwatch and data collection form to research
associates (RAs) who were trained in an identical manner in
Table 1. The altered mental status scale.

 the AMSS. In the event adequate sedation was not reached
prehospital, AMSS scores were recorded every 5 minutes in
the ED until adequate sedation was reached. After reaching
adequate sedation, stopwatch time was recorded. AMSS
scores were subsequently recorded every 30 minutes by RAs
until either hospital admission or discharge.
In addition to the parameters noted above, RAs also con-
tinually assessed real-time for airway and sedation complica-
tions
based
on
previously
defined
definitions
for
our
institution and research program.[21] If there was doubt
about whether a specific complication occurred, RAs queried
the treating physicians real time. RAs continually assessed for
and recorded the need for additional sedatives, complications
(specifically hypersalivation, emergence reaction, vomiting,
dystonia,
laryngospasm,
akathisia,
and
death),
intubation
(including indications for intubation), history of mental illness
or chemical dependency as recorded in the electronic med-
ical record, vital signs, and laboratory data (if obtained)
including breath ethanol concentration, serum ethanol con-
centration, venous pH, serum lactate, serum potassium, and
urine drug screen results. Urine drug screens included a bat-
tery of 12 immunoassays in addition to liquid and gas chro-
matography capable of screening for over 1000 different
compounds, though the vast majority of synthetic drugs were
not detectable. Subjects were analyzed as intention to treat.
Analysis
Medians and ranges were calculated for the primary outcome,
with the percentile difference and 95% confidence intervals
calculated using the Hodges–Lehmann Estimation. Secondary
outcomes of adequate sedation, complication rate and intub-
ation rate were analyzed with a Chi-Square test and 95% con-
fidence intervals for the difference between two proportions.
Data were entered into Microsoft Excel 2010 and analyzed
with Stata (StataCorp, College Station, TX). Descriptive statis-
tics were used for the remaining variables.
Results
Characteristics of study subjects
A total of 146 patients were enrolled. Sixty-four patients
received ketamine, 82 received haloperidol. For all enrolled
subjects, median scene time was 22 minutes and median
transport time was 8 minutes. Enrollment is delineated in
Figure 1. Baseline demographics, vital signs, and laboratory
values and ECG data were similar between groups (with the
exception of the initial heart rate and systolic blood pressure)
and are described in Tables 2 and 3. In the ketamine group,
the median dose was 5.2 mg/kg IM (range 1.7–8.5). With the
exception of a single patient, all patients in the ketamine
group received at least 3 mg/kg. In the haloperidol group, 5
patients received an initial dose of 5 mg IM, the rest received
10 mg IM.
Legally authorized representatives (LARs) who could pro-
vide consent for the patient were present in only 6% of cases.

Main results
Time to adequate sedation was significantly faster in the keta-
mine group. Median time to adequate sedation for the keta-
mine group was 5minutes (range 0.4–23) vs. 17minutes (range
2–84)
in
the
haloperidol
group
(p < 0.0001,
difference
12minutes,
95%
CI:
9–15).
Ninety-five
percent
(61/64)
of
patients in the ketamine group achieved adequate sedation pre-
hospital compared to 65% (53/82) of patients in the haloperidol
group (p< 0.0001, difference 0.3, 95% CI 0.18–0.42). Five per-
cent of patients in the ketamine arm (3/64) required additional
sedation prehospital (1 dose each of midazolam IM, ketamine
IM, and ketamine IV) whereas 20% of patients in the haloperidol
group required a second injection prehospital (15 doses of mid-
azolam, 1 dose of haloperidol). The complication rate was sig-
nificantly higher in the ketamine group. Complications occurred
in 49% (27/55) of patients receiving ketamine vs. 5% (4/82) in
the haloperidol group (p < 0.0001, difference 44%, 95% CI
0.3–0.57). Specific complications are delineated in Table 4. For
patients who had a weight recorded (n ¼ 35), median ketamine
dose was 5.2mg/kg (n ¼ 23, range 4.0–8.5mg/kg) in the group
experiencing
complications
and
5.1mg/kg
(n¼ 14,
range
1.7–6.25mg/kg) in the group without complications.
Intubation rate was also significantly higher in the keta-
mine group; 39% (25/64) of patients receiving ketamine were
intubated vs. 4% (3/82) of patients receiving haloperidol
(p < 0.0001, difference 35%, 95% CI 23–48%). For intubated
patients in the ketamine group who had a weight recorded
(n ¼ 35),
median
dose
was
5.2 mg/kg
(n ¼ 24,
range
4.0–8.5 mg/kg) in the intubated group and 5.1 mg/kg (n ¼ 13,
range 1.7–6.25 mg/kg) in the group not intubated. No intuba-
tions occurred prehospital. Primary indications for intubation
as recorded by research associates upon querying the intu-
bating physician are in Table 5. This table includes only the
primary indication for intubation as assigned by the intubat-
ing physician. Some patients had more than one indication
for intubation, such as hypersalivation.
Disposition
of
patients
receiving
ketamine
was
as
follows; home (n ¼ 12, 19%), acute psychiatric services (n ¼ 15,
23%), homeless shelter (n ¼ 2, 3%), floor admission (n ¼ 7,
11%), ICU admission (n ¼ 28, 44%). Disposition of patients
receiving haloperidol was as follows; home (n ¼ 43, 52%),
detoxification center (n ¼ 3, 4%), acute psychiatric services
(n ¼ 20, 24%), homeless shelter (n ¼ 3, 4%), floor admission
(n ¼ 7, 9%), ICU admission (n ¼ 5, 6%), workhouse (n ¼ 1, 1%).
For admitted patients, median time in hospital for patients
receiving ketamine was 60 hours (n ¼ 42, range: 4–894) versus
130 hours (n ¼ 16, range: 10–1034) for haloperidol. Physicians
more commonly ordered a urine drug screen if the patient
received ketamine (n ¼ 30) vs. haloperidol (n ¼ 7). Results are
delineated in Tables 3 and 6. Prehospital (paramedic) diagno-
ses are recorded in Table 7. Final discharge diagnoses either
from the ED or inpatient wards are delineated in Table 8.
Discussion
Acute undifferentiated agitation in the prehospital environ-
ment is both commonly encountered and poorly studied.

 In this study, ketamine was superior in terms of time to
adequate sedation. The median time to adequate sedation of
5 minutes with ketamine is consistent with both procedural
sedation literature [8] as well as retrospective data on patients
with prehospital acute undifferentiated agitation.[22] Such
rapid sedation is ideal to facilitate patient care and facilitates
field safety for the patient and paramedics. The median time
to adequate sedation of 17 minutes for haloperidol is similar
to previous published work both in the prehospital environ-
ment [5] and the emergency department.[23] Many EMS sys-
tems,

the

in
which
this
study
was
performed, have transport times similar to or shorter than
17 minutes, calling into question the effectiveness of haloperi-
dol
for
prehospital
acute
undifferentiated
agitation.
Furthermore, in these data, 20% of patients receiving halo-
peridol required a second sedative injection. The additional
risk to prehospital providers of introducing a second needle
into a high-risk patient encounter [24] also calls into question
the appropriateness of haloperidol as a single agent.
While time to adequate sedation favors ketamine, side
effect profile favors haloperidol. Nearly half of patients receiv-
ing ketamine experienced some kind of adverse event, some
of which were significant. Laryngospasm occurred in 5% of
patients receiving ketamine, much higher than the 0.3% rate
typically found in patients undergoing procedural sedation.[8]
It is also notable that 2 of the 3 patients that experienced
laryngospasm required intubation, which stands in contradis-
tinction to the typical course of ketamine-associated laryngo-
spasm
where
oxygen
and
bag-valve-mask
ventilation
is
adequate treatment.[25] Vomiting occurred at a rate of 9% in
the ketamine group, similar to previous literature.[26] The
occurrence of akathisia and dystonia in patients who received
ketamine is unexpected given ketamine’s mechanism of
action, however it is possible these were unrecognized emer-
gence reactions or patients in a partially dissociated state.
Emergence reactions occurred in 10% of patients receiving
ketamine, also similar to previous literature.[21]
The 39% rate of intubation for patients who received keta-
mine in these data is quite high. This is particularly surprising
as this study included only patients with a lesser degree of
agitation (AMSS ¼ þ2 and þ3) than is typically described in
the prehospital ketamine literature where the vast majority of
patients would score þ4 on the AMSS. In fact, the intubation
rate observed in the present study is high even compared to
patients with more profound agitation, up to and including
patients
with
excited
delirium
syndrome.
For
reference,
excited delirium syndrome patients would all score þ4 on the
AMSS. In a retrospective case series of 49 patients reported
by Burnett et al receiving IM ketamine 5 mg/kg for prehospi-
tal agitation, they observed a 29% intubation rate.[27] The
majority of patients in this case series were diagnosed with
the confounder of alcohol intoxication, and the indication for
intubation was most commonly noted as ‘‘failure to protect
airway.’’ Contrary to Burnett et al,[27] we did not observe a
positive association between higher doses of ketamine and
intubation. This lack of association is consistent with previ-
ously published procedural sedation literature [9] as well as a
larger
retrospective
study
more
recently
published.[18]
Further study is needed to determine if a link exists between
higher doses of ketamine and intubation. Keseg et al.
observed a similar intubation rate of 22% in a similar retro-
spective case series of 36 patients, the vast majority of
patients received IM ketamine 4 mg/kg.[28] In contrast to the
Burnett and Keseg data, Scheppke et al. observed a very low
intubation rate of 4% in a retrospective series of 52 patients
receiving 4 mg/kg of IM ketamine for prehospital agita-
tion.[11] In this series only 2 patients were intubated, and the
authors thought these intubations were related to co-adminis-
tered midazolam. However, this data is limited to prehospital
records, is not prospective, and does not comment upon ED
course for these patients.
The intubation rate of 39% in the present study is notable,
as the comparison group receiving haloperidol was intubated
only 4% of the time. As noted in the work by Burnett, et al,
indication for intubation is often quite vague in this patient
population.[23] In the present study, ‘‘not protecting airway
NOS’’ was the most common indication for intubation. It may
be, in fact, that the receiving emergency physicians were
either uncomfortable with a dissociated patient, or may have
misapplied the often quoted axiom of ‘‘intubation for a
Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 8.[29] ‘‘A patient dissociated
from ketamine most certainly cannot be evaluated properly
by the GCS, as they would appear to have a GCS of 3. In this
context, it may be better described as ‘‘GCS 3K’’ to denote
the influence of the dissociative anesthetic on the scoring.

 Nonetheless, this raises the question of whether patients are
being intubated simply for a perceived GCS of 3. While this is
certainly possible, the side effect profile seen in these data
suggests otherwise. For instance, 3 of 64 patients (4.7%) given
ketamine were found to have apnea. While the procedural
sedation literature suggests apnea occurs with a recom-
mended dose of IM ketamine at 4–5 mg/kg, at a rate closer
to 0.8% [7] and is often transient, our observed rate was
much higher with two apneic patients requiring intubation.
While the etiology of this is unclear, this may be a reflection
of co-intoxication, most commonly with ethanol. The synergis-
tic effects of concomitant exposure to multiple sedative-hyp-
notic medications causing CNS depression is well described in
both toxicology [30] and procedural sedation literature.[31]
While specific data on an interaction of ketamine and ethanol
is lacking, it is conceivable the presence of ethanol in the set-
ting of ketamine administration may prolong the typically
brief course of ketamine-related apnea. The same rationale
could apply to other CNS depressants, which based on avail-
able urine drug screens (Table 6) was very common in this
patient population.
Limitations
The primary limitations of the present study are its lack of
randomization and blinding. There is some evidence that
paramedics were less likely to sedate this patient population
when the only available sedative was ketamine as enrollment
was lower during this period. This may have introduced bias
in that only sicker, more agitated patients received ketamine
during that portion of the study. This may have been partially
mitigated by the inclusion criteria of a standardized agitation
score, however paramedics may have been willing to tolerate
the patient’s agitation during the ketamine arm whereas they
may have administered sedatives during the haloperidol arm.
Furthermore, a lack of blinding may have resulted in add-
itional testing in the ketamine arm. For instance, urine drug
screens were ordered much more frequently in the ketamine
group. No conclusions can be drawn regarding rates of intoxi-
cation on stimulants between the two groups because sam-
pling occurred at a much higher rate in the ketamine arm.
We suspect this is both due to the dissociated state of the
patients as well as an institutional electronic medical record
order set frequently used on patients who are intubated in
the ED.
A lack of randomization could have led to unequal groups,
however baseline demographics and vital signs were similar
between groups with the exceptions of initial heart rate, sys-
tolic blood pressure, and weight. The discrepancies in weight
are likely due to sampling error, as many patients did not
have a recorded weight. The higher initial heart rates and sys-
tolic blood pressure observed in patients who received keta-
mine
were
expected
given
the
adrenergic
effects
of
ketamine.[32]
Randomization was not possible in the current design of
this study as its introduction would clearly no longer repre-
sent minimal risk to the patient and either an Exception From
Informed Consent protocol or consent from a LAR would be
required. Though our previous work on agitation in the ED
revealed only a small fraction of agitated patients are con-
sentable via LAR15, it was unclear if consent via LAR would be
possible in the prehospital environment. As only 6% of
patients in the present study had a LAR present at the scene,
we believe further work in this area will require Exception
From Informed Consent if prehospital agitation is to be
studied in a randomized fashion.
The applicability of these data to the proper patient popu-
lation is also critical. These data in no way apply to patients
with excited delirium syndrome, a patient population that is
far more ill than those enrolled in the present study. Patients
with excited delirium syndrome experience profound agita-
tion
leading
to
metabolic
acidosis,
hyperthermia
and
extremely violent behavior that represent an immediate life-
threat to both the patient and their caregivers.[33] These
patients require rapid sedation to bring their metabolic
abnormalities under control, for which ketamine is an ideal
agent.[34] Isbister and colleagues recently observed ketamine
to be effective in patients with excited delirium syndrome
even after more traditional agents, including droperidol and
midazolam, had failed.[35] Despite the high intubation rate
and side effect profile observed with ketamine in the present
study, the risk-benefit ratio of ketamine is still favorable in
the critically ill excited delirium syndrome population.
Conclusions
Ketamine was superior to haloperidol in terms of time to
adequate sedation for severe prehospital acute undifferenti-
ated agitation in this prospective observational trial. The
median time to adequate sedation of 17 minutes for haloperi-
dol suggests its use as monotherapy is a poor choice for EMS
systems with short transport times or where the need for
fairly rapid behavior control is indicated. Ketamine, however,
is associated with significantly higher complication and intub-
ation rates. These data suggest that using ketamine for pre-
hospital agitation needs to be balanced against the context
of risk vs. benefit. Lastly, the absence of legally authorized
representatives to provide consent suggests informed consent
is not feasible when studying this patient population.
