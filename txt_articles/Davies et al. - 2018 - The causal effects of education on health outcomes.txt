Educated people are generally healthier, have fewer comorbidities and live longer than 
people with less education.1–3 Much of the evidence about the effects of education comes 
from observational studies, which can be affected by residual confounding. Natural 
experiments, such as increases to minimum school leaving age laws, are a potentially more 
robust source of evidence about the causal effects of education. Previous studies have 
exploited this natural experiment using population-level administrative data to investigate 
mortality, and surveys to investigate the effect on morbidity.1,2,4 Here, we add to the 
evidence using data from a large sample from the UK Biobank.5 We exploit the raising of

 the minimum school leaving age in the UK in September 1972 as a natural experiment.6 We 
used a regression discontinuity design to investigate the causal effects of remaining in 
school. We found consistent evidence that remaining in school causally reduced risk of 
diabetes and mortality in all specifications.
We do not know if the differences in outcomes across education groups is because education 
directly causes these outcomes, by affecting behaviors, such as smoking, or if these 
differences are due to other factors, such as socioeconomic or genomic differences. Whether 
education causes differences in outcomes later in life has been the subject of considerable 
debate by epidemiologists, economists and other social scientists.1–3,7–17 Economists have 
argued that in addition to its effects on income, a substantial portion of the benefits of 
education accrue via its potential effects on mortality and morbidity.3 Epidemiologists have 
found that people who attended university have higher fluid intelligence in adulthood.18 
These associations are robust to adjustment for parental social class and adolescent 
cognition, which has been taken by some as proof that education causes later outcomes.19 
Despite this, many epidemiologists and economists are acutely aware that correlations and 
multivariable adjusted regressions can be unreliable evidence of causation.20–22 The ideal 
experiment to test this hypothesis, randomizing the age at which children leave school, is 
unlikely to be ethical, cost-effective, or timely. A more feasible, and potentially robust, 
research design is to exploit natural experiments that affected when people left school but 
are not related to confounding factors.23,24 One widely used natural experiment are changes 
to the legal minimum school leaving age. These changes forced some people to stay in 
school for longer than they would have otherwise chosen.
In September 1972, the school leaving age increased from age 15 to 16 for children in 
England. Before the reform, the vast majority of those who left school at age 15 went into 
the labor force and found employment. The 1971 census indicated that in April 1971 32% of 
15-year olds were non-students, of whom 87% were in the labor force. At this time, the 
unemployment rates in this group were 21.7% and 14.9% for males and females 
respectively.25 Government discussions at the time of the reform raised concerns at the 
impact of the immediate withdrawal of 400,000 15-year olds from the labor force as a result 
of the reform. School leavers at this time were strongly attached to the labor market.26 
Researchers have previously used this policy change to investigate the effects of forcing 
students to stay in school longer using administrative data and longitudinal cohort studies.
2,4,27,28 However, the cohort studies had relatively small samples and, as a result, produced 
relatively imprecise estimates of the effects of education. Previous results from 
administrative data lacked detailed information needed to identify people born in England 
affected by the reform, or on many outcomes of interest such as cognition or clinical 
measures of aging such as grip strength.
In the current study, we used the raising of the school leaving age in 1972 as a natural 
experiment to estimate the causal effects of schooling. We used a regression discontinuity 
design and data from the UK Biobank.29,30 We add to the literature in two ways. First, this 
is the largest sample with detailed individual-level information from the school years 
immediately before and after the reform. Second, we used genome-wide data to demonstrate

 that the observational associations of education and other outcomes are likely to suffer from 
genomic confounding.
Of the 502,644 participants in the UK Biobank, who were all aged between 37 and 74 at 
recruitment in 2008, 390,412 were born in England, (see Supplementary Figure 1 for a flow 
diagram of inclusion and exclusion of participants in this study, and Supplementary Table 1 
for a description of their characteristics). The youngest participants, those born between 
1960 and 1971, obtained more education than those born earlier in the twentieth century 
(Figure 1). This is consistent with the well-documented secular increase in the length of 
education over the period.2 UK Biobank includes 11,240 and 10,898 participants who 
turned 15 years old in the last year before and the first year after the school leaving age 
increased. Before the reform, 85% of participants remained in school after the age of 15, 
whereas after the reform almost 100% of participants remained in school after the age of 15. 
The proportions of men and women who remained in school after age 15 increased over 
time (Supplementary Figure 2). Participants born in July and August could still technically 
leave school before their 16th birthday, this is why participants born in the summer term 
were more likely to report leaving school before the age of 16.
People who remained in school after age 15 had higher birth weights, their mothers were 
less likely to smoke during pregnancy, were more likely to have been breastfed, were more 
likely to have parents who were alive, and had fewer siblings (Supplementary Table 2). In 
addition they had more genetic variants (single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs)) known to 
associate with higher educational attainment31 (Supplementary Table 2). This suggests that 
the association of educational attainment and later outcomes will suffer from residual 
genomic confounding. In comparison, there were few detectable pre-existing differences 
between people affected and unaffected by the reform. The only detectable difference was 
that the parents of participants in the first year affected by the reform were more likely to be 
alive when they attended the assessment center in 2008-2010 (4.3 95% confidence intervals 
(95%CI): 2.5 to 6.1) and 3.7 (95%CI: 2.6 to 4.8) percentage points for father and mother 
respectively). These associations could be due to age effects, because on average the parents 
of those in the first year affected by the reform will be a year younger than parents’ of those 
in the previous school year. Alternatively, having more educated, and potentially richer 
offspring may increase parents’ longevity, perhaps via improved care.32 There was some 
evidence that fewer participants in the younger cohort were breastfed. On average, 
participants in the cohorts before and after the reform had similar numbers of education 
associated genetic variants. This suggests that associations of the reform and later outcomes 
are unlikely to suffer from residual genomic confounding. The participants affected by the 
reform are, by definition, an average of one year younger than those who were not affected. 
The raw differences above do not account for this age difference. There was little evidence 
of manipulation around the discontinuity (McCrary robust bias-corrected regression 
discontinuity manipulation test p=0.21).33
In this section we report two comparisons: first, the differences between participants who 
chose to stay in school after the age of 15 and those who left, and second, the regression 
discontinuity results. The regression discontinuity results are the difference between

 participants not affected by the reform (those born before September 1957) and those 
affected by it (those born in or after September 1957).
On average, participants who chose to stay in school after age 15 had better outcomes later 
in life. They were less likely: to be diagnosed with hypertension, diabetes, a stroke or a heart 
attack, to die, smoke or have ever smoked, and were more likely to be diagnosed with 
depression (left columns in Table 1). Rates of cancer diagnoses were similar across 
education levels. Participants who remained in school had stronger grips, lower arterial 
stiffness, and lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure. They also reported higher incomes, 
were taller, thinner, achieved higher scores on the intelligence test, drank more, watched less 
television, and exercised less. There was little difference in happiness.
Turning to the regression discontinuity results, there was little evidence that the reform 
affected rates of depression, diastolic blood pressure, and rates of moderate and vigorous 
exercise (right columns in Table 1). For the other outcomes, the effect of the reform was 
consistent in direction with the association of choosing to remain in school and the 
outcomes. We found some evidence that the reform may have had a larger effect on male’s 
likelihood of earning more than £31,000 (p-value for interaction=0.008), but little evidence 
of interactions by gender with any other outcomes (Supplementary Tables 3 and 4). There 
was some evidence that the reform had larger effects on participants predicted to leave 
before the age of 16: specifically increasing the likelihood of earning over £18,000 or 
£31,000, increasing grip strength and happiness, and alcohol consumption (Supplementary 
Table 5).
As a sensitivity analysis we repeated the analyses reported in Table 1 using Calonico, 
Cattaneo, and Titiunik (2014) optimal bandwidths (reported in Supplementary Tables 6, sex 
stratified in 7 and 8). These bandwidths are calculated using each outcome and the running 
variable (the difference between the participant’s date of birth and 1st of September 1957 in 
months). They minimize the mean squared error of the estimates. The bandwidths ranged 
from 24 to 65.4 months, greater than the 12 months used for the results above. These 
analyses allow for differential linear time trends either side of the reform. This substantially 
increased the sample size and statistical power (standard errors fell by a factor of between 
1.25 and 4). The results were consistent in direction with the main results reported in Table 
1, except for cancer, income over £100,000 and happiness. However, these differences are 
consistent with sampling error. Supplementary Tables 9, 10 and 11 provide the results for the 
regression discontinuity results using a one year bandwidth without using inverse probability 
weights (see methods below).
The associations reported in Table 1 are valid tests of the null hypotheses that education does 
not affect the outcomes. However, these associations are not informative about the size of 
the effect of remaining school. We estimated the effect of remaining in school using 
instrumental variable analysis. Participants affected by the reform were 23.0 (95%CI: 21.7, 
24.4) percentage points more likely to remain in school past age 15 than those who were 
unaffected. This suggests that these analyses are unlikely to suffer from weak instrument 
bias (min partial F-statistic=811). In Supplementary Table 12 we report instrumental 
variable estimates of the effect of remaining in school past the age of 15. The instrumental

 variable estimates are consistent in direction with the effect of the reform described above. 
There was evidence that the linear regression overestimated the effect of remaining in school 
on rates of ever or current smoking, income, intelligence, sedentary behavior, and exercise 
(all Hausman test for difference p<0.007).
The instrumental variable results imply that staying in school increases the likelihood of 
earning more than £18,000, £31,000 or £52,000 by 11.1 (95%CI: 8.9 to 13.3), 24.0 (95%CI: 
21.8 to 26.2) and 14.6 (95%CI: 9.8, 19.3) percentage points. These results exceeded the 
Benjamini and Hochberg (1995) false discovery rate threshold at δ=0.05 for 18 of the 25 
outcomes.34 Supplementary Figures 3 and 4 plot the point estimates and confidence 
intervals for the conventional linear regression and the instrumental variable estimates using 
a 12 month bandwidth. Supplementary Tables 13 and 14 report the instrumental variable 
results stratified by sex. There was little evidence the reform had larger effects on men than 
women, except for the likelihood of having income above £31,000 (p-value for 
interaction=0.009).
We investigated whether the differences in the outcomes seen in the regression discontinuity 
results could be solely explained by the aging process using a difference-in-difference 
approach. We created a series of non-overlapping negative control samples which contained 
participants born in consecutive school years in the 10 years before and after the reform. For 
each of these samples, we allocated the younger cohort to a “placebo” reform (see 
Supplementary Figure 1 for diagram and sample sizes). Within each of these negative 
control samples all the participants experienced the same minimum school leaving age. 
Therefore any differences between the younger and older school cohort cannot be due to the 
raising of the school leaving age in 1972, and are likely to be due to the aging process and 
not an effect of education.
Forest plots of the differences in the outcomes for the negative control analyses are reported 
in the supplementary materials (Supplementary Figures 5 to 29). There was evidence of an 
effect of age. On average, younger participants in both the ROSLA and negative control 
cohorts were less likely to: report having had a diagnosis of hypertension, a heart attack, or 
cancer, die during follow-up, currently smoke, report higher incomes, have higher grip 
strength, lower arterial stiffness, be taller and slimmer, have lower diastolic and systolic 
blood pressure, have higher scores on the intelligence tests, be less sedentary, and do less 
moderate exercise. The effect of the reform on diastolic blood pressure was similar to year-
on-year differences seen before the reform, but smaller than differences observed after the 
reform. The effect of the reform on likelihood of earning over £18,000 and £52,000 was 
similar to the year-on-year differences observed before the reform, but larger than the 
differences observed after the reform.
The effects of the reform on the outcomes after accounting for age are shown in Figure 2. 
The effect of the reform exceeded the false discovery threshold for: diabetes, stroke, 
mortality, former smoker, current smoker, earning over £18,000 or £31,000, grip strength, 
BMI, intelligence, alcohol consumption, and sedentary behavior. We report sensitivity 
analyses of the overall result without using inverse probability weights (see methods below) 
in Supplementary Figures 30 and 31. The effects of the reform exceed the false discovery

 rate threshold in both the weighted and unweighted analysis for diabetes, stroke, mortality 
and grip strength.
This study provides some of the strongest evidence to date about the causal effects of 
education. We found that the raising of the school leaving age in 1972 affected some health 
outcomes. A conservative analysis is to focus on the effects which were consistently found 
across all estimation methods. We found there was consistent evidence that the reform had 
generally beneficial effects on risk of diabetes and mortality. Finally, we found molecular 
genetic evidence that regression discontinuity designs using raising of the school leaving age 
are unlikely to suffer from residual genomic confounding.
Clark and Royer found the participants of the Health Survey for England and the General 
Household Survey affected by the reform were by 26.1 (95%CI: 23.0 to 29.2) percentage 
points more likely to stay in school after age 15.2 After correcting for under sampling of 
people who left school at 15, we found a slightly smaller difference (23.0 95%CI: 21.7, 
24.4). Clark and Royer found that people affected by the reform may have had lower 
mortality between the ages of 40 and 44 (odds-ratio=0.95, 95%CI: 0.89 to 1.01), but had no 
detectable effects on current or ever smoking, or drinking. Figure 3 presents a sensitivity 
analyses using identical bandwidths and covariates as in Clark and Royer for mortality, 
current and ever smoking, and drinking alcohol (coded as a binary rather than ordinal 
variable in our main analysis). As with our main results, the estimates using Clark and 
Royer’s specification suggest those affected by the reform had a substantially lower risk of 
mortality (odds-ratio=0.58, 95%CI: 0.39 to 0.87) (Figure 3). Furthermore, this difference 
was greater than the average year-on-year difference in mortality seen before and after the 
reform (Supplementary Figure 11).
The difference between the UK Biobank and Clark and Royer mortality results may be 
because the UK Biobank participants were almost ten years older (mean age=53.2 years) 
than the Clark and Royer sample. Clark and Royer sampled those aged 40 to 44 and had a 
five year follow-up. The 5 year mortality rate for this age group is 0.79%.35 The five leading 
causes of death for this age group in 2001 were cancer (22.9%), ischemic heart disease 
(14.9%), alcohol related disease (13.3%), suicides (12.1%) and accidental injuries (7.0%). In 
contrast, the subsample of the UK Biobank used in the study is comprised of individuals 
aged between 42 and 62 and has a 7.78 year follow-up. The 8 year probability of mortality 
between the ages of 42 and 62 was 3.44% in 2008. The five leading causes of death for this 
age group in 2008 were cancer (37.0%), ischemic heart disease (20.0%), alcohol related 
disease (9.0%), cerebrovascular diseases (5.7%) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(4.8%). Therefore, the absolute probability of mortality is over four times as high in the UK 
Biobank, and the causes of death differ. In particular, the risk of mortality due to smoking 
related illness, such as ischemic heart disease, cancer (particularly lung cancer), and chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease was much higher in UK Biobank. Therefore it is possible that 
Clark and Royer’s sample was too young to detect any difference in mortality. Finally, Clark 
and Royer could not exclude immigrants, who were not affected by the reform, from their 
sample. This could attenuate their estimates towards the null.

 In the sensitivity analysis reported in Figure 3, our estimates of the effect of the reform on 
smoking and alcohol consumption were almost identical to Clark and Royer. However, we 
found some evidence that the reform affected alcohol consumption and smoking rates using 
an ordinal measure of alcohol consumption, and tighter bandwidths. These effects exceeded 
the age effects found in the difference-in-difference analysis for the inverse probability 
weighted but not in the unweighted analysis. This suggests that the reform may have 
affected the frequency of alcohol consumption in those who drink alcohol, but had little 
effect on whether participants drank or not.
Epidemiologists have argued that education has causal effects on intelligence later in life. 
Richards and Sacker found that educational attainment by age 26 was associated with 
intelligence at age 53,36 which they argue was evidence that education had a causal effect 
on intelligence.19 However, Deary and Johnson raised doubts about this interpretation and 
called for greater clarity about the assumptions underlying these analyses.22 We found 
modest evidence of a causal effect of education on intelligence later in life from the inverse 
probability weighted estimates. This suggests the raw differences in intelligence between 
those who remain and leave school at age 15 may over-estimate the effect of schooling on 
cognition. Our results are also consistent with Nguyen and colleagues, who used increases in 
the legal school leaving ages in the United States to investigate the effects of education on 
risk of dementia later in life.24 They found evidence that education reduced the risk of 
dementia. We cannot test this hypothesis directly in the UK Biobank because too few 
participants have been diagnosed with dementia.
People with more education were much less likely to smoke. However, it is not clear 
whether this is due to a causal effect of education. Gilman and colleagues found the 
association between education and smoking status was attenuated in sibling fixed effects 
designs.37 We found evidence that participants affected by the reform were less likely to 
smoke, or have ever smoked. Educated participants drank more heavily, but the instrumental 
variable estimates suggested that this was likely to be an over-estimate of the causal effect of 
education on alcohol consumption. However, these effects only exceeded the false discovery 
rate in the weighted analysis. We found some evidence that the effects of the reform on 
income were greatest in participants who would otherwise have been expected to leave at 
age 15. Our results are consistent with those of Turley and colleagues who used data from 
the UK Biobank to investigate heterogeneity in the effects of education on BMI and blood 
pressure. They used a 110 month bandwidth and a triangle kernel to weigh their results. 
Their results allowing for differential linear trends before and after the reform suggested that 
remaining in school caused a 0.42 (95%CI: -0.30 to 1.14) kg/m2 reduction in BMI, and a 2.3 
(95%CI: -0.1 to 4.7) percentage point reduction in risk of diabetes.38
A key strength of our study is that we used a natural experiment to identify the effects of 
education. The raising of the school leaving age in 1972 provided exogenous variation in the 
length of schooling. We found few pre-existing differences between participants on either 
side of the reform, suggesting that it can be used as a potentially valid instrumental variable.
39 A strength of our study is that it uses one of the largest samples to date to investigate the 
effects of education on a wide range of outcomes. Our outcomes were recorded both in 
clinics and via linked NHS mortality registry data. This means our outcomes are likely to

 suffer from relatively little measurement error. Furthermore, we were able to restrict our 
sample to people born in England who were affected by the reform. In addition, we used 
genome-wide data to show that this natural experiment is unlikely to suffer from residual 
genomic confounding. Participants unaffected and affected by the reform had very similar 
genome-wide scores for education. A potential limitation of our study is that our treatment 
group, people affected by the reform, are one year younger than our control group, those 
born in the last school year unaffected by the reform. Many of the outcomes we investigated 
increase linearly or log-linearly over time. This means it is difficult to determine if any of 
the differences we observed in the regression discontinuity design with 12 month 
bandwidths were due to an additional year of aging or the reform. We addressed this by 
using a difference-in-difference approach to estimate the average effects of a year of aging 
(Figures 3), and allowed for a differential linear time trend before and after the reform as a 
sensitivity analysis using wider bandwidths (Supplementary Tables 4 to 6). These results 
suggest that aging rather than the reform are likely to explain the differences observed across 
the regression discontinuity for outcomes such as height. However, it is likely the reform 
affected outcomes where substantial effects remained in the difference in difference analysis.
A representative sample is not a necessary condition for making causal inferences.40 
Nevertheless, collider (attenuation) bias could affect our results because Biobank is a 
volunteer sample, which over-sampled more educated people. People affected by the reform 
may be more likely to participate in the study.41 This could cause less educated people, who 
would have remained in school had they attended school after the reform (the compliers), to 
be under-represented in UK Biobank. This could attenuate our results towards the null, 
because these marginal students would reduce the average outcome in the “treatment” group, 
and be missing from the “control” group. This would improve the control group’s outcomes 
relative to the treatment group. Despite these differences we found little evidence that people 
affected by the reform were more likely to participate in UK Biobank (see Supplementary 
Figure 32). In our primary analysis we used inverse probability weighting to account for this 
sampling. This requires the assumption that the participants sampled in UK Biobank who 
left school at age 15 are representative of the population that left school at age 15. However, 
this issue warrants further investigation in future research.
There was limited time to collect measures during the participants’ assessment center visits, 
therefore our measure of intelligence is relatively coarse. Despite this, participants who 
remained in school had substantially higher intelligence. The instrumental variable estimates 
suggest that this difference substantially overestimates the causal effect. Finally, our 
instrumental variable results are estimates of the local average treatment effect of schooling.
42 They can be interpreted (“point identified”) either under the assumption that the reform 
had a monotonic effect on likelihood of staying in school (monotonicity), or that the effects 
of schooling on the outcomes was not affected by the reform (no effect modification).43 
Under the monotonicity assumption, our results are estimates of the causal effects of being 
forced to remain in school after the age of 15, on those who would otherwise have left 
school. These effects may not be externally valid to infer either the effects of compelling 
students to remain in school for longer, or of the effects of education on other populations.
44,45 In particular, these results may not be valid estimates of the effect of education on 
“always takers”, that is people who would always remain in school regardless of the reform.

 Under the no effect modification assumption, we identify the average effect of education on 
those who remained in school. At a minimum, our results are internally valid estimates of 
the effects of schooling on people affected by the reform.
Does education affect outcomes later in life? Yes, whilst education is not the panacea 
implied by naïve multivariable adjusted regression, in this sample increasing the length of 
compulsory schooling had substantial benefits. We found robust evidence that staying in 
school is likely to have causal effects on risk of diabetes and mortality. These results add to 
our understanding of the long-term consequences of educational decisions in childhood and 
adolescence.
Materials and Methods
Data
We used data from 502,624 participants of the UK Biobank project.29 The participants, aged 
between 37 and 74, were originally recruited between 2006 and 2010. In our regression 
discontinuity analysis, we restricted our sample to participants were born in England in the 
school cohorts in years immediately before and after the reform took place. We do this 
because we have a large enough sample born in these years to precisely identify the effects 
of schooling.
Exposure: left school after age 15
The participants were asked if they had a college or university degree. If they did not have a 
degree they were asked what age they left full-time education. We coded participants who 
reported having a degree as leaving full-time education at age 21. Participants who did not 
report the having a degree and did not have data on the age at which they left education were 
coded as missing.
Outcomes
Health outcomes—The participants were asked whether they had ever been diagnosed by 
a doctor with the following health conditions: hypertension, stroke, type 2 diabetes, or heart 
attack. They were asked if they had ever had a whole week where they felt depressed or 
down. The death of the participants was defined using linked NHS mortality registry data. 
Follow-up for the linked mortality data started with the first death on 10th May 2006 ended 
with the last recorded death on 17th February 2014. The cancer diagnoses were taken from 
the national cancer registries. The first recorded cancer diagnosis was on 20th September 
1957 and the last on 25th October 2013.
Height, BMI, blood pressure, arterial stiffness, grip strength, and intelligence
Height and weight were measured during the participants’ visit to a UK Biobank assessment 
center. Two measures of diastolic and systolic blood pressure were recorded via an 
electronic blood pressure monitor. The measurements were taken two minutes apart. Arterial 
stiffness was measured using an electronic measuring device. Grip strength was measured in 
kilos using a hydraulic hand dynamometer. We residualized the measures of grip strength 
and arterial stiffness to control for potential between device heterogeneity. Fluid intelligence

 was measured via the number of 13 logic puzzles that the participants could answer 
correctly in 2 minutes.
Health behaviors and income
During their assessment center visit, the participants were asked to report their health 
behaviors. They were asked about how frequently they consumed alcohol. This is coded 6 if 
they drank every day, 5 for three or four times a week, 4 for once or twice a week, 3 for one 
to three times a week, 2 for special occasions only, and 1 for never. They were asked if they 
smoked, or had ever smoked. They were asked how often they moderately and vigorously 
exercised in a typical week. Finally, they were asked if their pre-tax income was below 
£18,000, between £18,000 and £30,999, between £31,000 and £51,999, between £52,000 
and £100,000, or above £100,000. Participants who did not answer these questions were 
coded as missing.
Genotype data
The participants provided a blood sample. This sample was used to extract DNA and 
genotype using the Axiom and BiLEVE genome-wide arrays. These arrays genotyped 
around 800,000 SNPs for each participant. The genotyping data was used to impute SNPs 
which were not directly genotyped using the 1000 genomes and UK10K reference panels. 
The imputation produced a likelihood of each participant having a specific genotype (e.g. 
AA=0.1, TA=0.9, and TT=0). This resulted in a dataset of around 80,000,000 SNPs. For 
each participant, we created a genome-wide allele score by summing the number of genetic 
variants they had that were associated with higher educational attainment. We weighted each 
variant by its association with education reported in a large genome-wide association study, 
using a version of the GWAS not including UK Biobank.31 This study reported the 
association of 8,259,394 genetic variants and years of education in a meta-analysis of 64 
studies. We normalized the allele score have mean zero and standard deviation one. This 
score only explains a minority (r2=1.32% in the full Biobank sample) of the variation in 
educational attainment explained by genome-wide data.31,46,47 This is because of limited 
statistical power of existing genome-wide association studies of educational attainment. One 
consequence of this is that the genetic score is too poor a proxy for the total genetic effects 
on educational attainment to be used as a conventional covariate in a regression. Therefore 
we use the educational attainment genome-wide score to test whether on average 
participants affected by the reform had more genetic variants known to associate with 
education.39
Statistical methods
We use the changes in the school leaving age to identify the effects of schooling on a range 
of outcomes. Our empirical strategy has five steps. First, we estimated the effect of the 
reforms on the proportion of participants who remained in school after age 15. Second, we 
investigated the associations of potential confounders with educational attainment and across 
the cohorts affected by the reform.39 Third, we used a regression discontinuity design to 
estimate the effect of the reform on the outcomes. Fourth, we used instrumental variable 
estimators to estimate the effects of the remaining in school. For continuous outcomes, we 
used conventional Wald estimators,48 for binary outcomes we used semi-parametric additive

 structural mean models.43 To address concerns about multiple hypothesis testing, we report 
whether the instrumental variable results for each outcome exceed a Benjamini and 
Hochberg (1995) false discovery rate threshold at δ=0.05 across 25 outcomes.34 Fifth, we 
conducted a difference in difference analyses.34
Inverse probability weighting
The UK Biobank is a volunteer sample, and as a result people who were left school at age 16 
were less likely to attend the clinics than previous studies (17.5% versus 33% reported in 
Clark and Royer, 2013). Non-random (endogenous) sampling can induce associations in the 
sampled data, even if an exposure has no causal effect on an outcome.49 This is a particular 
concern when attempting to draw causal inferences. If the probability of sampling is known, 
then inverse probability weights can be used to account for the non-random sampling.50 
Therefore, we corrected for the non-random sampling using inverse probability weights 
(equal to 33/17.5=1.8857) for participants who left school at age 15.51 This assumes that the 
participants who reported leaving school at age 15 are a representative sample of the sub-
population who left at 15. If this assumption does not hold, for example if the sampled 
participants who left at 15 were healthier than those in the population, then the estimates 
could under estimate the differences between the groups. We report the unweighted results 
as a sensitivity analysis in the appendix.
Identification
The raising of the school leaving age will be a valid natural experiment for testing whether 
remaining in school at age 15 affects later outcomes under the following three assumptions. 
First, participants who attended school after the leaving age was increased must be more 
likely to stay in school. Second, there must be no pre-existing differences between the cohort 
who attended school in the year immediately before and immediately after the reform. 
Finally, the reform must not have any other direct effects on the outcomes. We can test the 
first assumption by investigating whether participants affected by the reform are more likely 
to stay in school. We can falsify the second assumption by investigating if there were any 
pre-existing differences between those affected and unaffected by the reform. The final 
assumption cannot be empirically tested, and could be invalid if the reform also affected the 
labor market around the time that the participants entered the workforce. However, claimant 
count statistics for the UK show that the cohorts entering the labor force immediately before 
and after the reform faced broadly similar conditions, with increases in unemployment 
related to the oil crises of the 1970s not being seen until 1975 onwards.52,53 In particular, 
youth unemployment was almost as low as all age unemployment in the years immediately 
before the reform, around 5 to 7% for males and 2 to 3% for females, compared with 5% 
and 1.5% respectively for all age unemployment. This continued to be the case in 1974 when 
the first post-reform cohort entered the labor market: youth unemployment was 3.6% and 
2.0% compared with 3.5% and 1.0% for all age unemployment rate for males and females 
respectively.25
1 The effect of the reform on educational attainment
We used a fuzzy regression discontinuity design to estimate the effects of increasing the 
school leaving age from age 15 to 16 on the proportion of students who report leaving

 school before the age of 15. To investigate the effect of the reform on school attendance we 
estimated a regression of staying school after age 15 on a dummy variable equal to one if the 
participant was a member of the cohort affected by the reform, and equal to zero if they were 
not affected. In this and all subsequent analyses we included covariates for the month of 
birth, to control for seasonality, and sex. In contrast to Clark and Royer (2013), we do not 
include a term for birth cohort because our regression discontinuity results are restricted to 
people born in the single school years immediately before and after the reform. The 
regression discontinuity design is identified by assuming that the reform is independent of 
the unobserved confounding factors, and has no other direct effects on the outcome. The 
effect of the reform on the probability of participants staying in school after the age of 15, 
our parameter of interest, is the effect of remaining in school on those who were affected by 
the reform. We report this parameter on the risk or mean difference scale for binary and 
continuous outcomes. Our regressions allow for general form heteroskedasticity and 
clustering by year and month of birth.
2 Specification tests
We compared the associations of seven potential confounders Cict and the exposure, left 
school after the age of 15, Eict, and the indicator of the reform, Dic. We estimated these 
associations conditional on the same set of covariates, Xict
′ , as above and the standard errors 
allow for clustering by year and month of birth. In addition we test for manipulation of the 
forcing variable (number of months from 1st September 1957 to the participant’s birthday) 
using McCrary density tests to test for selection across the period before and after reform.

3 Effects of increasing the school leaving age on outcomes in later life
A Regression discontinuity—We estimated the associations of leaving school after 
age 15 and the outcomes and the association of the reform and each of the outcomes using 
the following linear regressions:
Hict = δ0 + δ1Eic + wict, and
Hict = τ0 + τ1Dic + ζict
The first is a linear regression of each of the health outcomes on whether the participant 
remained in school after the age of 15. The second regression is the association of the health 
outcomes and the reform. As above, each regression includes terms for sex and month of 
birth to account for the season of birth. This is a valid test of the null-hypothesis that 
remaining in school does not affect the outcomes.
We tested whether the reform had larger effects on people who would otherwise have been 
expected to leave school at age 15. We estimated the probability that a participant would 
remain in school after the age of 15 using logistic regression and data from individuals born 
before 31st August 1956. This model included indicators for the participants’ assessment

 center, year and month of birth, sex, whether mother smoked during pregnancy, were 
breastfed, number of brothers and sisters, the normalized genome-wide education score, and 
their ethnicity. Missing data were replaced at the mean and indicators variables for missing 
values were included. We estimated the following regression:
Hict = φ0 + φ1Dic + φ2DicEic + φ3Eic + ζict
Where Eic is probability of remaining in education from the logistic regression. For each 
outcome we report the coefficients on the reform indicator, and the coefficient on the 
interaction term and the effect of the reform. The effect of the reform on participants 
predicted to leave is indicated by φ1, and the effect on those expected to stay is indicated by 
φ1 + φ2. As with the main results above we adjust for sex and month of birth, and the 
interaction of these variables with predicted education.55
As a sensitivity analysis we used a regression discontinuity design with variable month 
bandwidths to investigate the robustness of our findings. In our the main analysis above we 
present difference in outcomes for the last school cohort of participants before the reform 
(those born between September 1956 and August 1957) and the first cohort affected by the 
reform (those born between September 1957 and August 1958). This is a regression 
discontinuity analysis with a bandwidth of one year. This is a fuzzy regression discontinuity 
design, as the reform only increased the probability of staying in school.56 In a sensitivity 
analyses we investigated whether our results were sensitive to the size of the bandwidth 
around the reform. We did this by repeating our instrumental variable analyses on a sample 
defined using Calonico, Cattaneo, and Titiunik (2014) optimal bandwidths.57 Analyses 
using these bandwidths use the same specification as the instrumental variable analyses 
described above, and in addition include linear time-trends which vary either side of the 
reform. We estimated the optimal bandwidths using the rdbwselect command in Stata.
B Instrumental variables—We estimated the causal effect of schooling using 
instrumental variables estimators. We estimated mean differences using Wald estimators,48 
and risk differences using additive structural mean models, for the continuous and binary 
outcomes respectively.43 These models can be identified by making one of three 
assumptions.43 First, for the continuous outcomes we could assume that staying in school 
has the same effect on the outcomes for all participants. This identifies the average effects of 
staying in school but is implausible for binary outcomes.58 Second, for the binary outcomes, 
we could assume a monotonic relationship between the reform and the participants’ 
likelihood of staying in school after the age of 15. In the potential outcomes framework, that 
E[Y(1) − Y(0)|E(1) − E(0) > 0]. This requires that there were no participants who were 
“defiers”, who would have remained in school if they were not affected by the reform, but 
would have left school if they were affected by the reform. Under monotonicity, the 
instrumental variable estimators estimate a local average treatment effect. This is the effects 
of treatment in the sub-group of participants whose decisions were affected by the reform.48 
That is the people in the year after the reform who would have chosen to leave school at 15 
had the reform not been introduced. Finally, we could assume that the effects of education 
are not affected by the reform (no effect modification). This would identify the effects of

 education on participants who remained in school. We report the partial F-statistic of the 
association of remained in school Eict and the reform Dic. We also report the test for 
endogeneity (using a C-statistic, which is a heteroskedasticity robust Hausman test 59,60, 
that E[Eictwict] = 0). This implicitly tests for differences between the linear regression and 
instrumental variable estimates.60 All estimates allow for clustered standard errors by year 
and month of birth and include controls for sex and month of birth.
C Difference-in-difference—We were concerned that differences between the two 
school years may occur because of the participants affected by the reform were a year 
younger on average than participants unaffected by the reform. To investigate this, we 
estimated the year-on-year differences in each outcome for the five non-overlapping two-
year cohorts in the 10 years before and after the reform. Otherwise, we used an identical 
specification to the regression discontinuity analysis above. There are no changes to the 
school leaving ages between each of these years. Therefore any year-on-year differences 
observed in these “negative control cohorts” must be due other factors, such as age effects, 
and cannot be an effect of raising the school leaving age in 1972. We compared these 
estimates using forest plots, which are reported in the supplementary materials. We pooled 
the year-on-year differences from the 5 negative control samples from before and after the 
reform using the Stata command metan. We calculated the difference between this pooled 
estimate and difference between the years before and after the reform. We estimated the 
difference and the standard error of this difference using Bland-Altman tests.61

Years of full-time education by quarter of birth. Each dot represents the proportion who left 
education before the given age per quarter. The black line indicates the first cohort of 
participants who were affected by the reform implemented in September 1972. These 
participants were born after in or after September 1957 and faced a minimum school leaving 
age of 16. This is a one year increase compared to those born before September 1957. The 
participants who did not have a university degree were asked, “What age did you leave full-

The effect of the reform on each outcome estimated via difference in differences. The units 
in the top panel are reported on the absolute risk difference scale (risk differences per 100 
people). This is interpreted as the change in the number of events per 100 people affected by 
the reform. The units for the bottom panel differ by outcome and are listed in the legend on 
left hand side. All estimates control for gender and month of birth. Estimates are the 
difference between the year-on-year difference in outcome across the raising of the school 
leaving age compared to the average year on year difference. Estimated using robust linear

 regression, with standard errors clustered by month of birth and weighting. Differences and 
confidence intervals calculated using Bland-Altman tests.61 The estimates for diabetes, 
stroke, mortality, former and current smoking, income over £18k, and £31k, grip strength, 
BMI, intelligence, alcohol consumption and sedentary behavior exceed Benjamini and 
Hochberg (1995) threshold for multiple hypothesis testing. Max N=262,348.

 Figure 3. 
The effect of the 1972 reform on mortality, smoking, ever smoking and alcohol consumption 
from the Office of National Statistics Census (summary data from the entire English and 
Welsh population) and the General Health Survey for England (min N=47,177) (▲) (Clark 
and Royer, 2013) and (■) the UK Biobank. All estimates adjust for the month of birth, sex, 
and a linear time trend which can differ before and after the reform. Estimated using robust 
linear regression, with standard errors clustered by month of birth and weighting. Current 
and ever smoking and alcohol consumption additionally adjust for age cubed. Inverse 
probability weights were used to correct for under-sampling of participants who left school 
at age 15 (weight=1.8857). The bandwidths are 74, 72, 74, and 138 months for mortality, 
current smoking, ever smoking, and drink alcohol respectively. In this analysis alcohol 
consumption is coded as a binary variable equal to one if the participant states they ever 
drink (93.3%), in the main results alcohol is coded as an ordinal variable. Mortality results 
are log odds of death. The Clark and Royer mortality results relate to the risk of mortality in 
the five years between the ages of 40 to 44, whereas UK Biobank participants were between 
the ages of 42 and 62 and follow-up spanned 7.78 years (over the period 10th May 2006 and 
17th February 2014).

Table 1
The associations of remaining in school after age 15, and attending school after the raising of the school leaving age (ROSLA) and outcomes. Participants 
born between September 1956 and August 1958. ROSLA= Raising of the school leaving age. Estimated using robust linear regression, with standard 
errors clustered by year and month of birth. All estimates adjust for the month of birth and sex. The same sample was used for both the conventional 
linear regression and ROSLA analyses. Inverse probability weights used to correct for under-sampling of participants who left school at age 15 
(weight=1.8857). The difference in outcomes between those who remained and left school at age 15 are included for comparison, and may suffer from 
residual confounding. * denotes mean differences.
