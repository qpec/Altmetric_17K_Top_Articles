Abstract
Schizophrenia is a heritable brain illness with unknown pathogenic mechanisms. Schizophrenia’s 
strongest genetic association at a population level involves variation in the Major 
Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) locus, but the genes and molecular mechanisms accounting 
for this have been challenging to recognize. We show here that schizophrenia’s association with 
the MHC locus arises in substantial part from many structurally diverse alleles of the complement 
component 4 (C4) genes. We found that these alleles promoted widely varying levels of C4A and 
C4B expression and associated with schizophrenia in proportion to their tendency to promote 
greater expression of C4A in the brain. Human C4 protein localized at neuronal synapses,

schizophrenia and may help explain the reduced numbers of synapses in the brains of individuals

Introduction
Schizophrenia is a heritable psychiatric disorder involving impairments in cognition, 
perception and motivation that usually manifest late in adolescence or early in adulthood. 
The pathogenic mechanisms underlying schizophrenia are unknown, but observers have 
repeatedly noted pathological features involving excessive loss of gray matter1,2 and reduced 
numbers of synaptic structures on neurons3–5. While treatments exist for the psychotic 
symptoms of schizophrenia, there is no mechanistic understanding of, nor effective therapies 
to prevent or treat, the cognitive impairments and deficit symptoms of schizophrenia, its 
earliest and most constant features. An important goal in human genetics is to find the 
biological processes that underlie such disorders.
More than 100 loci in the human genome contain SNP haplotypes that associate with risk of 
schizophrenia6; the functional alleles and mechanisms at these loci remain to be discovered. 
By far the strongest such genetic relationship is schizophrenia’s unexplained association 
with genetic markers across the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) locus, which 
spans several megabases of chromosome 66–10. The MHC locus is best known for its role in 
immunity, containing 18 highly polymorphic human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes that 
encode a vast suite of antigen-presenting molecules. In some autoimmune diseases, genetic 
associations at the MHC locus arise from alleles of HLA genes11,12; however, 
schizophrenia’s association to the MHC is not yet explained.
Though the functional alleles that give rise to genetic associations have in general been 
challenging to find, the schizophrenia-MHC association has been particularly challenging, as 
schizophrenia’s complex pattern of association to markers in the MHC locus spans hundreds 
of genes and does not correspond to the linkage disequilibrium (LD) around any known 
variant6,10. This prompted us to consider cryptic genetic influences that might generate 
unconventional genetic signals. The most strongly associated markers in several large case/
control cohorts were near a complex, multi-allelic, and only partially characterized form of 
genome variation that affects the C4 gene encoding complement component 4 (Extended 
Data Fig. 1). The association of schizophrenia to CSMD16,10, which encodes a regulator of 
C413, further motivated us to consider C4.
Results
C4 structures and MHC SNP haplotypes
Human C4 exists as two functionally distinct genes (isotypes), C4A and C4B; both vary in 
structure and copy number. One to three C4 genes (C4A and/or C4B) are commonly present 
as a tandem array within the MHC class III region (Fig. 1a, Extended Data Fig. 1g) 14–18. 
The protein products of C4A and C4B bind different molecular targets19,20. C4A and C4B

 segregate in both long and short genomic forms (C4AL, AS, BL and BS), distinguished by 
the presence or absence (in intron 9) of a human endogenous retroviral (HERV) insertion 
that lengthens C4 from 14 to 21 kb without changing the C4 protein sequence16 (Fig. 1b).
We developed a way (Extended Data Fig. 2) to identify the “structural haplotypes” of C4 – 
the copy number of C4A and C4B and the long/short (HERV) status of each C4A and C4B 
copy – present on 222 copies of human chromosome 6. Using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR), 
we found that genomes contained 0–5 C4A genes, 0–3 C4B genes, 1–5 long (L) C4 genes, 
and 0–3 short (S) C4 genes (Extended Data Fig. 2a, b). We also developed assays to 
determine the long/short status of each C4A and C4B gene copy (Extended Data Fig. 2c), 
thus revealing copy number of C4AL, C4BL, C4AS, and C4BS in each genome (Methods).
We analyzed inheritance in father-mother-offspring trios (Extended Data Fig. 2d) to identify 
the C4A and C4B contents of individual alleles (Extended Data Fig. 2e). We found that 4 
common C4 structural haplotypes (AL-BL, AL-BS, AL-AL, and BS) were collectively 
present on 90% of the 222 independent chromosomes sampled; 11 uncommon C4 
haplotypes comprised the other 10% (Fig. 1c).
The series of many SNP alleles along a genomic segment (the SNP haplotype) can be used 
to identify chromosomal segments that come from shared common ancestors. We identified 
the SNP haplotype(s) on which each C4 locus structure was present (Fig. 2). The three most 
common C4 locus structures were each present on multiple MHC SNP haplotypes (Fig. 2). 
For example, the C4 AL-BS structure (frequency 31%) was present on five common 
haplotypes (frequencies 4%, 4%, 4%, 8%, and 6%) and many rare haplotypes (collective 
frequency 5%, Fig. 2). Reflecting this haplotype diversity, each of these C4 structures 
exhibited real but only partial correlation to individual SNPs (Extended Data Fig. 3). The 
relationship between C4 structures and SNP haplotypes was generally one-to-many: a C4 
structure might be present on many haplotypes, but a given SNP haplotype tended to have 
one characteristic C4 structure (Fig. 2).
C4 expression variation in the brain
Since C4A and C4B vary in both copy number and C4-HERV status (Fig. 1), and because 
other HERVs can function as enhancers21–23, C4 variation might affect C4 genes’ 
expression. We assessed how C4 structural variation related to RNA expression of C4A and 
C4B in eight panels of post mortem human adult brain samples (674 samples from 245 
distinct donors in 3 cohorts, Methods).
The results of this expression analysis were consistent across all five brain regions analyzed. 
First, RNA expression of C4A and C4B increased proportionally with copy number of C4A 
and C4B respectively (Fig. 3a, b; Extended Data Fig. 4). (These observations mirror earlier 
observations in human serum24.) Second, expression levels of C4A were 2–3 times greater 
than expression levels of C4B, even after controlling for relative copy number in each 
genome (Fig. 3c). Third, copy number of the C4-HERV sequence increased the ratio of C4A 
to C4B expression (p < 10−7, p < 10−2, p < 10−3) (Fig. 3c, Extended Data Fig. 4).

 We used the above data to create genetic predictors of C4A and C4B expression levels in the 
brain (Methods). If C4A or C4B expression levels influence a phenotype, then the aggregate 
genetic predictor might associate to schizophrenia more strongly than individual variants do.
C4 structural variation in schizophrenia
Schizophrenia cases and controls from 22 countries have been analyzed genome-wide for 
SNPs, implicating the MHC locus as the strongest of more than 100 genome-wide-
significant associations6. Our analysis above showed that long haplotypes defined by many 
SNPs carry characteristic C4 alleles (Fig. 2), potentially making it possible to infer C4 
alleles by statistical imputation25 from combinations of many SNPs. We used our 222 
integrated haplotypes of MHC SNPs and C4 alleles (Fig. 2) as reference chromosomes for 
imputation. We found that the four most common structural forms of the C4A/C4B locus 
(BS, AL-BS, AL-BL, and AL-AL) could be inferred with reasonably high accuracy 
(generally 0.70 < r2 < 1.00).
We then analyzed SNP data from 28,799 schizophrenia cases and 35,986 controls, from 40 
cohorts in 22 countries contributing to the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC)6. We 
evaluated association to 7,751 SNPs across the extended MHC locus (chr6: 25–34Mb), to 
C4 structural alleles (Fig. 1c), and to HLA sequence polymorphisms imputed from the SNP 
data. We also predicted levels of C4A and C4B expression from the imputed C4 structural 
alleles.
The association of schizophrenia to these genetic variants exhibited two prominent features 
(Fig. 4a, b). One feature involved a large set of similarly-associating SNPs spanning 2 Mb 
across the distal end of the extended MHC region. (Below we use this set’s most strongly 
associating SNP, rs13194504, as its genetic proxy.) The other peak of association centered at 
C4, where schizophrenia associated most strongly with the genetic predictor of C4A 
expression levels (p = 3.6×10−24) (Fig. 4a, Extended Data Fig. 5). In the region near C4 
(chromosome 6, 31–33 Mb), the more strongly a SNP correlated with predicted C4A 
expression, the more strongly it associated with schizophrenia (Fig. 4b, bottom panel).
Although the variation at C4 and in the distal extended MHC region associated to 
schizophrenia with similar strengths (p = 3.6×10−24 and 5.5×10−28, respectively), their 
correlation with each other was low (r2 = 0.18, Fig. 4b), suggesting that they reflect distinct 
genetic influences. Conditional analysis confirmed this: in analyses controlling for either 
rs13194504 or genetically predicted C4A expression, the other genetic variable still defined 
a genome-wide-significant association peak (p = 7.8×10−10 and 8.0×10−14, Fig. 4c, d). 
Controlling for both genetic variables revealed a third association signal just proximal to the 
MHC locus (Fig. 4e) involving SNPs around BAK1 and SYNGAP1, the latter of which 
encodes a major component of the postsynaptic density; de novo loss-of-function mutations 
in SYNGAP1 associate with autism26. In joint analysis, all three genetic signals remained 
significant (p = 8.0×10−14, 2.8×10−8, and 1.7×10−8, respectively) and no additional genome-
wide significant signals remained in the MHC locus (Fig. 4f).
In some autoimmune diseases with genetic associations in the MHC locus, alleles of HLA 
genes associate more strongly than do other variants in the MHC locus, appearing to explain

 the associations11,12. In contrast, in schizophrenia, classical HLA alleles associated to 
schizophrenia less strongly than other genetic variants in the MHC region did (Extended 
Data Fig. 6). We further considered the strongest schizophrenia associations to classical 
HLA alleles at distinct loci (involving HLA-B*0801, HLA-DRB1*0301, and HLA-
DQB1*02); conditional analysis indicated that each could be explained by LD to the 
stronger signals at C4 and rs13194504 (Extended Data Fig. 7).
If each C4 allele affects schizophrenia risk via its effect on C4A expression, then this 
relationship should be visible across specific C4 alleles. We measured schizophrenia risk 
levels for the common C4 structural alleles (BS, AL-BS, AL-BL, and AL-AL); these alleles 
showed relative risks ranging from 1.00 to 1.27 (Fig. 5a). We also estimated (from the post 
mortem brain samples) the C4A expression levels generated by these four alleles (Fig. 5b). 
Schizophrenia risk and C4A expression levels yielded the same ordering of the C4 allelic 
series (Fig. 5a, b).
We sought an even more stringent test. If this allelic series of relationships to schizophrenia 
risk (Fig. 5a) arises from C4 locus structure – rather than from other genetic variation in the 
MHC locus – then a given C4 structure should exhibit the same schizophrenia risk regardless 
of the MHC haplotype on which it appears. We measured the schizophrenia association of 
all 13 common combinations of C4 structure and MHC SNP haplotype (Fig. 5c). Across this 
allelic series, each C4 allele exhibited a characteristic level of schizophrenia risk, regardless 
of the haplotype on which it appeared (Fig. 5c).
C4A RNA expression in schizophrenia
These genetic findings (Fig. 5a,c) predict that C4A expression might be elevated in brain 
tissue from schizophrenia patients. We measured C4A RNA expression levels in brain tissue 
from 35 schizophrenia patients and 70 individuals without schizophrenia. The median 
expression of C4A in brain tissues from schizophrenia patients was 1.4-fold greater (p = 
2×10−5 by Mann-Whitney test; Fig. 5d) and was elevated in each of the five brain regions 
assayed (Extended Data Fig. 8). This relationship did not meaningfully change in analyses 
adjusted for age or post mortem interval. The relationship remained significant after 
correcting for the higher average C4A copy number among the brain donors affected with 
schizophrenia (1.3-fold greater, p = 0.002). Some earlier studies have also reported elevated 
levels of complement proteins in serum of schizophrenia patients27,28.
C4 in the central nervous system
C4 is a critical component of the classical complement cascade, an innate-immune-system 
pathway that rapidly recognizes and eliminates pathogens and cellular debris. In the brain, 
other genes in the classical complement cascade have been implicated in the elimination or 
“pruning” of synapses 29–31.
To evaluate the distribution of C4 in human brain, we performed immunohistochemistry on 
sections of the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. We observed C4+ cells in the gray and 
white matter, with the greatest number of C4+ cells detected in the hippocampus. Co-
staining with cell-type-specific markers revealed C4 in subsets of NeuN+ neurons (Fig. 6a; 
antibody specificity further evaluated in Extended Data Fig. 9a) and a subset of astrocytes.

 Much of the C4 immunoreactivity was punctate (Fig. 6b), colocalizing with synaptic puncta 
identified by co-immunostaining for the pre- and postsynaptic markers VGLUT1/2 and 
PSD95 (Fig. 6b). These results suggest that C4 is produced by, or deposited on, neurons and 
synapses.
To further characterize neuronal C4, we cultured human primary cortical neurons and 
evaluated C4 expression, localization and secretion. Neurons expressed C4 mRNA and 
secreted C4 protein (Extended Data Fig. 9c). Neurons exhibited C4-immunoreactive puncta 
along their processes and cell bodies (Fig. 6c, d; antibody specificity further evaluated in 
Extended Data Fig. 9b). About 75% of C4 immunoreactivity localized to neuronal processes 
(Fig. 6c); of the C4 in neuronal processes, approximately 65% was observed in dendrites 
(MAP2+, NF+ processes) and 35% in axons (MAP2-, NF+ processes). Punctate C4 
immunoreactivity was observed at 48% of structural synapses as defined by co-localized 
synaptotagmin and PSD-95 (Fig. 6d).
The association of increased C4 with schizophrenia (Fig. 4, 5), the presence of C4 at 
synapses (Fig. 6b, d), the involvement of other complement proteins in synapse 
elimination29–31, and earlier reports of decreased synapse numbers in schizophrenia 
patients3–5, together suggested that C4 might work with other components of the classical 
complement cascade to promote synaptic pruning. To test this hypothesis, we moved to a 
mouse model. (C4A and C4B appear to have functionally specialized outside the rodent 
lineage, but the mouse genome contains a C4 gene that shares features with both C4A and 
C4B, Extended Data Fig. 10a, b). Impairments in schizophrenia tend to affect higher 
cognitive functions and recently-expanded brain regions for which analogies in mice are 
uncertain32. However, waves of postnatal synapse elimination occur in many brain regions, 
and strong experimental models have been established in several mammalian visual systems 
in which synaptic projections from retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) onto thalamic relay 
neurons within the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) of the visual thalamus undergo 
activity-dependent synaptic refinement29–31,33–35. We found that C4 RNA was expressed in 
the LGN and in RGCs purified from retina (Extended Data Fig. 10c).
In the immune system, C4 promotes C3 activation, allowing C3 to covalently attach onto its 
targets and promote their engulfment by phagocytic cells. In the developing mouse brain, C3 
targets subsets of synapses and is required for synapse elimination by microglia, the 
principal CNS cells expressing receptors for complement29,30. We found that in mice 
deficient in C436, C3 immunostaining in the dLGN was greatly reduced compared to WT 
littermates (Fig. 7a, b), with fewer synaptic inputs being C3-positive in the absence of C4 
(Fig. 7c). These data demonstrate a role for C4 in complement deposition on synaptic inputs.
We then evaluated whether mice deficient in C4 had defects in synaptic remodeling, as has 
been described for C3-deficient mice29. Mice lacking functional C4 exhibited greater 
overlap between RGC inputs from the two eyes (p < 0.001) than wild-type littermate 
controls, suggesting reduced synaptic pruning (Fig. 7d; Extended Data Fig. 10d, e; 
Methods). The degree of deficit in C4−/− mice was similar to that previously reported for 
C1q−/− and C3−/− mice29,31. Heterozygous C4+/− mice, with one wild-type copy of C4, had

 an intermediate phenotype (Fig. 7d). These data provide direct evidence that C4 mediates 
synaptic refinement in the developing brain.
Discussion
We developed ways to analyze a complex form of genome structural variation (Fig. 1–2) and 
discovered that schizophrenia’s association with variation in the MHC locus involves many 
common, structurally distinct C4 alleles that affect expression of C4A and C4B in the brain; 
each allele associated with schizophrenia risk in proportion to its effect on C4A expression 
(Fig. 3–5). We found that C4 is expressed by neurons, localized to dendrites, axons, and 
synapses, and secreted (Fig. 6); and that C4 promotes synapse elimination during the 
developmentally timed maturation of a neuronal circuit (Fig. 7).
In humans, adolescence and early adulthood bring extensive elimination of synapses in 
distributed association regions of cerebral cortex, such as the prefrontal cortex, that have 
greatly expanded in recent human evolution37–40. Synapse elimination in human association 
cortex appears to continue from adolescence into the third decade of life39. This late phase 
of cortical maturation, which may distinguish humans even from some other primates37, 
corresponds to the period during which schizophrenia most often becomes clinically 
apparent and patients’ cognitive function declines, a temporal correspondence that others 
have also noted41.
Principal pathological findings in schizophrenia brains involve loss of cortical gray matter 
without cell death: affected individuals exhibit abnormal cortical thinning1,2 and abnormally 
reduced numbers of synaptic structures on cortical pyramidal neurons3–5. The possibility 
that neuron-microglia interactions via the complement cascade contribute to schizophrenia 
pathogenesis – for example, that schizophrenia arises or intensifies from excessive or 
inappropriate synaptic pruning during adolescence and early adulthood – would offer a 
potential mechanism for these longstanding observations about age of onset and synapse 
loss. Many other genetic findings in schizophrenia involve genes that encode synaptic 
proteins6,42–44. Diverse synaptic abnormalities might interact with the complement system 
and other pathways45,46 to cause excessive simulation of microglia and/or elimination of 
synapses.
The two human C4 genes (C4A and C4B) exhibited distinct relationships with schizophrenia 
risk, with increased risk associating most strongly with variation that increases expression of 
C4A. Human C4A and C4B proteins, whose functional specialization appears to be 
evolutionarily recent (Extended Data Fig. 10a), show striking biochemical differences: C4A 
more readily forms amide bonds with proteins, while C4B favors binding to carbohydrate 
surfaces19,20, differences with an established basis in C4 protein sequence and structure47,48. 
An intriguing possibility is that C4A and C4B differ in affinity for an unknown binding site 
at synapses.
To date, few GWAS associations have been explained by specific functional alleles. An 
unexpected finding at C4 involves the large number of common, functionally distinct forms 
of the same locus that appear to contribute to schizophrenia risk. The human genome

 contains hundreds of other genes with complex, multi-allelic forms of structural variation49. 
It will be important to learn the extent to which such variation contributes to brain diseases 
and indeed to all human phenotypes.

 (a–f) Data for several schizophrenia case-control cohorts that were genome-scanned before 
we began this work (a–d) exhibits peaks of association near chr6:32Mb (blue vertical line) 
on the human genome reference sequence (GRCh37/hg19). Note that association patterns 
vary from cohort to cohort, reflecting statistical sampling fluctuations and potentially 
fluctuations in allele frequencies of the (unknown) causal variants in different cohorts. 
Cohorts such as in (b), (e) and (f) suggest the existence of effects at multiple loci within the 
MHC region. Even in the cohorts with simpler peaks (a, c, d), the pattern of association 
across the individual SNPs at chr6:32 Mb does not correspond to the linkage disequilibrium 
(LD) around any known variant. This motivated the focus in the current work on cryptic 
genetic influences in this region that could cause unconventional association signals that do 
not resemble the LD patterns of individual variants.
(g) A complex form of genome structural variation resides near chr6:32 Mb. Shown here are 
three of the known alternative structural forms of this genomic region. The most prominent 
feature of this structural variation is the tandem duplication of a genomic segment that 
contains a C4 gene, 3’ fragments of the STK19 and TNXB genes, and a pseudogenized copy 
of the CYP21A2 gene. (This cassette is present in 1–3 copies on the three alleles depicted 
above; the boundaries below each haplotype demarcate the sequence that is duplicated.) 
Haplotypes with multiple copies of this module (middle and bottom) contain multiple 
functional copies of C4, whereas the additional gene fragments or copies denoted STK19P, 
CYP21A2P, and TNXA are typically pseudogenized. (Rare haplotypes with a gain or loss of 
intact CYP21A2 have also been observed18.) Note that although C4A and C4B contain 
multiple sequence variants, they are defined based on the differences encoded by exon 26, 
which determine the relative affinities of C4A and C4B for distinct molecular targets19,20 
(Fig. 1). Many additional forms of this locus appear to have arisen by non-allelic 
homologous recombination and gene conversion (ref18 and Fig. 1).

analyses of the C4 locus18. For the rarer C4 structures, genomic order of C4 gene copies is 
hypothesized or provisional.

 Panels g and h show data for tissues from the SMRI Neuropathology Consortium (anterior 
cingulate cortex and cerebellum, respectively). These data were then used to inform (by 
linear regression) the derivation of a linear model for predicting each individual’s RNA 
expression of C4A and C4B as a function of the numbers of copies of AL, BL, AS, and BS. 
The derivation of this model, and the regression coefficients induced, are described in 
Methods.
In the rightmost plot of each panel, expression of C4A (per genomic copy) is normalized to 
expression of C4B (per genomic copy) to more specifically visualize the effect of the C4-
HERV by controlling for genomic copy number and for any trans-acting influences shared 
by C4A and C4B; the inferred regression coefficients (Methods) suggest that the observed 
effect is mostly due to increased expression of C4A.

 Evaluation of the association of schizophrenia with HLA alleles and coding-sequence 
polymorphisms. (a–e) Associations to HLA alleles and coding-sequence polymorphisms are 
shown in black; to provide the context of levels of association to nearby SNPs, associations 
to other SNPs are shown in gray. The series of conditional analyses shown (b–e) parallels 
the analyses in Fig. 4. Further detail on the most strongly associating HLA alleles (including 
conditional association analysis) is provided in Extended Data Fig. 7.
Extended Data Figure 7. 
Detailed association analysis for the most strongly associating classical HLA alleles. The 
most strongly associating HLA loci were HLA-B (in primary analyses, Fig. 4a, Extended 
Data Fig. 6a) and HLA-DRB1 and -DQB1 (in analyses controlling for the signal defined by 
rs13194504, Fig. 4c, Extended Data Fig. 6b). At these loci, the most strongly associating 
classical HLA alleles were HLA-B*0801, HLA-DRB1*0301, and HLA-DQB*02, 
respectively. These HLA alleles are all in strong but partial LD with C4 BS, the most 
protective of the C4 alleles; they are also in partial LD with the low-risk allele at

analyses with each of these HLA alleles, genetically predicted C4A expression and

not.

 (a) The functional specialization of C4 into C4A and C4B in humans does not have an 
analogy in mice. Although the mouse genome contains both a C4 gene and a C4-like gene 
(classically called Slp), and these genes are also present as a tandem duplication within the 
mouse MHC locus, analysis of the encoded protein sequences indicates a distinct 
specialization, as illustrated by the protein phylogenetic tree. Above, mouse Slp is indicated 
in gray to reflect its potential pseudogenization: Slp is already known to have mutations at a 
C1s cleavage site, which are thought to abrogate activation of the protein through the 
classical complement pathway56; and the M. musculus reference genome sequence (mm10) 
at Slp shows a 1-bp deletion (relative to C4) within the coding region at chr17:34815158, 
which would be predicted to cause a premature termination of the encoded protein. (In some 
genome data resources, mouse Slp and C4 have been annotated respectively as “C4a” (e.g. 
NM_011413.2) and “C4b” (e.g. NM_009780.2) based on synteny with the human C4A and 
C4B genes, but the above sequence analysis indicates that they are not paralogous to C4A 
and C4B.)
(b) Sequence differences between C4A and C4B – which are otherwise 99.5% identical at 
an amino acid level – are concentrated at the “isotypic site” where they shape each isotype's 
relative affinity for different molecular targets19,20. At the isotypic site, mouse C4 contains a 
combination of the residues present in human C4A and C4B.
(c) Expression of mouse C4 mRNA in whole retina and lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) 
from P5 animals and in purified retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) from P5 and P15 animals. 
These time points were chosen as P5 is a time of more robust synaptic refinement in the 
retinogeniculate system compared to P15. The same assays detected no C4 RNA in control 
RNA isolated from C4−/− mice (not shown).
N = 3 samples for p5 retina, LGN, and P15 RGCs, N = 4 samples for P5 RGCs; * p < 0.05 
by ANOVA with post hoc Tukey-Kramer multiple-comparisons test.
(d) Representative images of dLGN innervation by contralateral projections (red in bottom 
image), ipsilateral projections (green in bottom image), and their overlap (yellow in bottom 
image). Scale bar = 100 µm
(e) Quantification of the percentage of total dLGN area receiving both contralateral and 
ipsilateral projections shows a significant increase in C4−/− compared to WT littermates 
(ANOVA, N = 5 mice/group, p < 0.01). These data are consistent with results using R-value 
analysis as shown in Fig. 7.
(f) Quantification of total dLGN area showed no significant difference between WT and 
C4−/− mice (ANOVA, N = 5 per group, p > 0.05).
(g) Quantification of dLGN area receiving ipsilateral innervation showed a significant 
increase in ipsilateral territory in the C4−/− mice compared to WT littermates (AVOVA, N = 
5 mice/group, p > 0.01). This result is consistent with defects in eye specific segregation. 
Scale bar = 100 µm
(h) The number of RGCs in the retina was estimated by counting the number of Brn3a+ 
cells in WT and C4−/− mice. No differences were observed between WT and C4−/− (t-test, 
N = 4 mice/group, p > 0.05). Scale bar = 100 µm.

mRNA expression of C4A (a) and C4B (b) was measured (by ddPCR) in brain tissue from 
244 individuals. Copy number of C4A, C4B, and the C4-HERV were measured (by ddPCR 
analysis of genomic DNA) in the brain donors. The results were consistent across 8 panels 
of brain tissue representing 5 brain regions and 3 distinct sets of donors (one set shown here, 
with data from 101 individuals; all panels in Extended Data Fig. 4; a few outlier points are 
beyond the range of these plots but are shown in Extended Data Fig. 4.) P-values were 
obtained by a Spearman rank correlation test. In panel c, expression of C4A (per genomic 
copy) is normalized to expression of C4B (per genomic copy) to control for trans-acting 
influences shared by C4A and C4B.

location of the C4 gene). The data shown are based on analysis of 28,799 schizophrenia 
cases and 35,986 controls of European ancestry from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium. 
The height of each point represents the statistical strength (−log10(p)) of association with 
schizophrenia.

 (a, b) Association of schizophrenia to SNPs in the MHC locus and to genetically predicted 
expression of C4A and C4B. In (b), genetic variants are colored by their levels of correlation 
to rs13194504 (upper panel) or by their levels of correlation to genetically predicted brain 
C4A expression levels (lower panel).
(c–f) Conditional association analysis. The red dashed line indicates the statistical threshold 
for genome-wide significance (p = 5×10−8).
See also Extended Data Fig. 5–7 for detailed association analyses involving C4 locus 
structures and HLA alleles.

 Figure 5. C4 structures, C4A expression, and schizophrenia risk
(a) Schizophrenia risk associated with four common structural forms of C4 in analysis of 
28,799 schizophrenia cases and 35,986 controls.
(b) Brain C4A RNA expression levels associated with four common structural forms of C4. 
β was calculated from fitting C4A RNA expression (in brain tissue) to the number of 
chromosomes (0, 1, or 2) carrying each C4 structure (across 120 individuals sampled).
(c) Schizophrenia risk associated with 13 combinations of C4 structural allele and MHC 
SNP haplotype. The numbers on the y-axis adjacent to the C4 structures indicate the 
“haplogroup”, the MHC SNP haplotype background on which the C4 structure segregates, 
and correspond to Fig. 2. Statistical tests of heterogeneity yielded p = 0.55 for AL-AL 
alleles; p = 0.93 for AL-BL alleles; p = 0.06 for AL-BS alleles; and p = 5.7 × 10−5 across the 
overall allelic series.
(d) Expression levels of C4A RNA were directly measured (by RT-ddPCR) in post mortem 
brain samples from 35 schizophrenia patients and 70 individuals not affected with 
schizophrenia. Measurements for all five brain regions analyzed exhibited the same

 Figure 6. C4 protein at neuronal cell bodies, processes and synapses
(a) C4 protein localization in human brain tissue. Two representative confocal images 
(drawn from immunohistochemistry performed on samples from five individuals with 
schizophrenia and two unaffected individuals) within the hippocampal formation 
demonstrate localization of C4 in a subset of NeuN+ neurons.
(b) High-resolution structured illumination microscopy (SIM) imaging of tissue in the 
hippocampal formation reveals colocalization of C4 with the presynaptic terminal marker 
Vglut1/2 and the postsynaptic parker PSD95.
(c) Confocal images of primary human cortical neurons show colocalization of C4, MAP2, 
and neurofilament along neuronal processes.
(d) Confocal image of primary cortical neurons stained for C4, presynaptic marker 
synaptotagmin, and postsynaptic marker PSD95.
Scale bar for a, c, and d = 25 µm; b = 5 µm; b (inset)= 1 µm. Extended Data Fig. 9 contains 
additional data on antibody specificity

 Figure 7. C4 in retinogeniculate synaptic refinement
(a) Representative confocal images of immunohistochemistry for C3 in the P5 dLGN 
showed reduced C3 deposition in the dLGN of C4−/− mice compared to WT littermates.
(b) Quantification confirmed reduced C3 immunoreactivity in the dLGN (N = 3 mice/group, 
p < 0.05, t-test; y-axis: mean fluorescence intensity, normalized to WT).
(c) Co-localization analysis revealed a reduction in the fraction of VGLUT2+ puncta that 
were C3+ in C4-deficient mice relative to their WT littermates (N = 3 mice/group, p = 
0.0011, two-sided t-test).
(d) Synaptic refinement in mice with 0, 1, or 2 copies of C4. These images represent the 
segregation of ipsilateral and contralateral RGC projections to the dLGN; two analysis 
methods were used. (Top) Projections from the ipsilateral (green) and contralateral (red) 
eyes show minimal overlap (yellow) in WT mice. The overlapping area is significantly

 increased in C4−/− mice (N = 6 mice/group, p < 0.01, ANOVA with Bonferroni post tests). 
(Bottom) Threshold-independent analysis using the R-value50(R = log10[Fipsi/Fcontra]). 
Pixels are pseudocolored with an R-value heat map (red indicates areas having only 
contralateral inputs; purple, only ipsilateral inputs). Compared to their WT littermates, C4-
deficient mice exhibited lower R-value variance, indicating defects in synaptic refinement (N 
= 6 mice/group, p < 0.001, ANOVA with Bonferroni post tests). Control experiments 
analyzing total dLGN size, dLGN area receiving ipsilateral input, and number of RGCs are 
shown in Extended Data Fig. 10f–h, respectively.
Error bars in (b), (c), and (d) represent S.E.M.
