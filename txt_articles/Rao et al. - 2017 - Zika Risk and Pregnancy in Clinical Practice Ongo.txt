Abstract
Objective—To describe a single U.S. perinatal referral center’s ongoing experience with 
evaluating pregnant patients with potential exposure to Zika virus infection.
Methods—This is an IRB approved longitudinal observational study from January – August 
2016 from a single high-volume perinatal referral center. Subjects who had traveled to, or had 
sexual contact with a person who traveled to a region with documented local Zika virus 
transmission were included in the study. The aim of the study was to identify the rate of confirmed 
infection among pregnant women referred to our center with established risk factors for Zika virus 
acquisition. We also sought to characterize travel patterns that constituted risk, to identify rates of 
symptoms suggesting infection, and to potentially describe findings suggestive of congenital Zika 
virus infection in prenatal ultrasound evaluations.
Results—We evaluated 185 pregnant women with potential Zika virus exposure. Testing was 
offered in accordance with the version of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
guidelines in place at the time of the consult visit. Geographic exposure data showed Mexico 
(44%), the Caribbean (17%), North America (16%), South America (13%), and Central America 
(9%) to be the most common areas in which potential exposure occurred. One hundred and twenty 
three (67%) patients reported insect bites and 19 (10%) patients reported symptoms. Overall, 6 
(3% of all) patients had prenatal ultrasound findings suggestive of possible fetal Zika virus 
infection; all their Zika virus test results returned negative. These findings included: microcephaly, 
echogenic intracardiac foci, and ventricular calcifications. Of the 153 Zika Virus screening tests 
ordered, 8 (5%) IgM results have returned positive or equivocal, with only 1 positive through 
confirmatory testing. Overall, 1/185 (0.5%) of all those consulted and 1/153 (0.7%) of those tested 
had a confirmed Zika virus infection, with no confirmed fetal or neonatal infections.

 Conclusion—Despite low rates of confirmed infection in our current cohort, as the outbreak 
continues to unfold into greater geographical regions, clinicians need to be prepared to answer 
questions, explain laboratory and ultrasound results, and describe testing options for concerned 
patients and their families.
Introduction
In November 2015, the Brazilian Ministry of Health reported a 20 fold increase in the 
number of cases of neonatal microcephaly, a severe congenital neurologic malformation 
with significant long term sequelae [1, 2], which has since been linked to maternal infection 
with the Zika virus during pregnancy[3]. Semen and blood products have also been shown to 
be potentially infectious, raising concerns that non-vector borne virus plays a role in the 
spread of Zika. In addition, Zika-specific RNA has been detected in amniotic fluid, breast 
milk, seminal fluid, saliva, urine and blood, raising public health concerns for the prevention 
and control of Zika virus globally [4].
As the Zika virus outbreak has spread across the Americas, a spectrum of neonatal 
neurologic and developmental abnormalities attributable to congenital infection has been 
described [5]. While neurologic impact in adults has also been demonstrated, including but 
not limited to Guillain-Barre Syndrome[6, 7], the preponderance of pathophysiology has 
occurred in fetuses and newborns, producing an understandable degree of anxiety among 
pregnant women in areas with local transmission, as well as those pregnant women who 
have traveled to those regions or engaged in sexual contact with partners who have traveled 
to those regions [8–10]. The fact that Zika virus infection is symptomatic in only 20 percent 
of cases [11], and that perinatal impact has been shown in both symptomatic and 
asymptomatic women, has only heightened concern among women and families in Zika 
virus-risk areas, including, as of July 2016, those in the Miami-Dade, Florida and, most 
recently, the Brownsville, Texas regions of the United States[12].
Since the outbreak has been described, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
(CDC) has issued evolving guidelines for providers in the United States, regarding 
counseling and testing for women who are either pregnant or planning pregnancy with 
potential Zika virus exposure [13, 14]. These guidelines have sequentially expanded testing 
criteria to maximize the number of potentially infected pregnant women who are identified, 
as more information regarding the implications of perinatal Zika virus infection have 
become available.
The importance of counseling and testing of pregnant women regarding Zika virus infection 
and its risks has compelled providers to be current regarding guidelines as they evolve, to 
best guide women and their families through this outbreak. We describe the ongoing 
experience of a single U.S. metropolitan perinatal center regarding the triage and testing of 
pregnant women referred specifically for concerns regarding potential Zika virus infection. 
While we describe the subsequent surveillance of this population that was guided by their 
test results, our primary focus and intent was to more completely describe the quality of care 
required in providing testing and counseling to this particularly concerned cohort of patients.

 Materials and Methods
We conducted a longitudinal observational cohort study at a single perinatal referral center 
from January-August 2016. This center provides comprehensive consultative services to 
providers and their patients in a large population center in Southern California. After the first 
CDC travel advisory surrounding Zika virus and pregnancy was issued in Feb 2016 [14], a 
travel history was obtained on every patient seen at our center. As expanded guidelines were 
published throughout the study period, testing criteria based on symptoms and exposures in 
pregnant women were modified accordingly [13]. Subjects were included in the study if they 
had traveled to, or had sexual relations with a person who traveled to a region where local 
Zika virus transmission had been reported. All pregnant patients who were potentially 
exposed to Zika virus infection between August 2015 and August 2016 were included in the 
data collection. Institutional Review Board approval was obtained from the University of 
California, Los Angeles (IRB# 16-000285).
We sought to identify the rate of confirmed infection among pregnant women in our referral 
region who had established risk factors for acquiring infection, either through personal travel 
or travel by a sexual partner. We also sought to characterize the travel patterns of exposure-
risk for women in this region, since travel concerns comprise a significant proportion of 
questions received by our center on a daily basis. Lastly, we sought to describe rates of 
symptoms among these women suggesting Zika virus infection, as well as any findings on 
their prenatal ultrasounds that might raise concern for Zika virus infection. Patients were 
questioned, as recommended by clinical guidelines published by the CDC, about the 
presence of any of the following symptoms: rash, fever, conjunctivitis, myalgias, and 
headache [14] during travel times or immediately after return. If exposure was via sexual 
contact with a partner who had traveled to a high-risk region, the patient was asked if she 
had experienced any of these symptoms after that contact. The patient was also asked about 
condom use prior to and after partner exposure.
Ultrasound evaluation of patients at risk either because of positive test results, or inability to 
test because of timing of the patient visit, was guided by reports of Zika associated findings 
as described by Brasil et al., which is the largest published prospective cohort to date that 
followed pregnant women with confirmed Zika infection. We also referred to the consensus 
statement published by the World Health Organization, which describes ultrasound findings 
associated with congenital Zika syndrome [15]. In addition, while echogenic intracardiac 
foci have not specifically been linked to known Zika virus infection, they were included as a 
finding of concern in our study given the prior description of prenatally visualized 
hyperechogenic cardiac valves in cases of known neonatal Zika virus infection [16, 17]. 
Microcephaly was defined as head circumference measurements that were 3 standard 
deviations below the mean, as reinforced by a recent policy statement by the Society for 
Maternal Fetal Medicine [18, 19].
Prior to the revised CDC guidelines of July 25, 2016 [13], Zika virus polymerase chain 
(PCR) testing on blood and urine were offered only to women who described Zika virus-
suggestive symptoms after potential exposure. After the revised guidelines, PCR testing was 
offered to all women regardless of symptoms who presented within 2 weeks of potential

 exposure in them or a sexual partner. For those who presented 2–12 weeks post-exposure, 
testing was offered via the approved MAC-ELISA IgM assay. Patients with positive or 
equivocal IgM results had confirmatory testing of the original sample via plaque reduction 
neutralization testing (PRNT) in an approved reference laboratory. Testing was offered 
initially through public health laboratories then, later in the study period, through 
commercial laboratories that had been approved to conduct these tests under emergency use 
authorizations (EUA) from the FDA.
Descriptive statistics, as well as Kruskall-Wallis tests for non-parametric data, were used to 
evaluate the results .Stata 14 (College Station, TX) was used for descriptive statistics and 
Kruskall-Wallis tests, and EpiTools was used for the analysis of confidence intervals.
Results
During the defined study period, we identified 185 pregnant women who had potential Zika 
virus exposure either through travel (94%) or sexual contact (6%) [Table 1]. Time of 
exposure during travel is further categorized as short-term (less than 30 days in a high-risk 
region) or long-term (more than 30 days in a high-risk region). None of the patients with 
exposure secondary to sexual contact with a partner endorsed using condoms prior to 
evaluation in our center. Our cohort ranged in age from 25 to 51 (median age: 34). The 
majority of our patients were Caucasian (63%), followed by Asian (16%), Hispanic (14%), 
African-American (2%), and Middle Eastern (3%). The majority of patients (51%) had 
traveled to a Zika-risk area prior to the CDC’s initial Zika travel advisory published in 
February 2016, which first described expanded testing during pregnancy, independent of the 
woman’s symptoms. The majority of all exposures occurred either just prior to conception or 
during the first trimester (64%).
Geographic exposure data showed Mexico (44%), North America (17%), and the Caribbean 
(16%) to be the most common areas in which patients’ personal or partner exposures 
potentially occurred. As outbreaks of local infection began to be described and tracked in the 
Miami-Dade area, however, travel exposures from this region provided a large proportion of 
exposure cases in the later part of the study period (17% of all exposures).
Within our cohort, 67% of patients reported mosquito bites, but only 10% of patients overall 
reported any symptoms suggestive of Zika virus infection. The patients reporting symptoms 
had mostly traveled to Mexico and the Caribbean (53%).
Five patients (3%, 95% CI: 1.1%–6.2%) had prenatal ultrasound findings suggestive of 
possible Zika virus infection; all these findings ultimately had negative Zika virus testing 
results. Findings reported as potential markers for Zika virus included: microcephaly, 
echogenic intracardiac foci, and intracranial ventricular calcifications. All findings resolved 
prior to delivery or resulted in a neonate without evidence of Zika virus sequelae.
After assessment of testing appropriateness per guidelines in place at the time of the patient 
encounter, Zika virus-specific testing was ordered on 153 patients. The other 32 women fell 
outside guideline based testing time frames post-exposure, and were alternatively offered 
serial fetal ultrasound surveillance through the third trimester. The most common tests

 requested were IgM assays, in 141 patients, with the majority of these (71%, CI: 63.7%–
78.0%) performed in public compared to commercial laboratories. Maternal serum PCR 
testing was ordered in 12 patients, almost all after the change in testing criteria in July 2016. 
After the FDA permitted some commercial labs to run IgM and PCR testing under an 
Emergency Use Authorization [20], issues of cost and turn around time, were discussed with 
all patients, who were then given the option of using either a commercial or public 
laboratory for testing. Patient lab preference appears to have been at least partly impacted by 
the significant differences seen in turn- around times for test results. The range and mean 
time for results was markedly shorter for commercial compared to public laboratories: 2 – 
25 days vs. 13–158 days, median 6 vs. 34 days (p<0.001).
For the IgM results, 8 returned positive or equivocal (5% of all tests, CI: 2.5%–10.0%), with 
only 1 confirmed as positive by PRNT. Overall, 1/185 (0.5%, CI: .06%–2.5%) of all those 
consulted and 1/153 (0.7%, CI: .07%–3.0%) of those pregnant women tested had a 
confirmed Zika virus infection, with no confirmed fetal or neonatal infections [Figure 1]. 
The 1 woman with serologically confirmed Zika virus infection had short-term exposure (12 
days) in her early first trimester, from travel to Honduras. She did report mosquito bites, but 
denied any symptoms suggestive of Zika infection. Intracranial calcifications were present 
on ultrasound evaluation in the second trimester; however ultimately resolved upon serial 
evaluation in the third trimester. This patient opted to undergo diagnostic amniocentesis in 
the 2nd trimester, with negative amniotic fluid Zika virus-PCR results. She subsequently 
delivered a normally grown newborn with no stigmata of ZIKV infection. PCR for Zika 
virus was ordered on the neonate’s cord blood; however, results are unavailable for review 
secondary to difficulties with laboratory processing. At three months of age, the infant has 
shown no signs of Zika sequelae on serial pediatric exams.
Discussion
Pregnant patients in the Southern California region referred to our center have had potential 
Zika virus exposure primarily related to travel to high risk areas for local transmission, with 
a smaller proportion describing possible exposure via travel by a sexual partner. In our study 
cohort, despite extensive potential travel exposure to 23 international regions documenting 
local transmission of the Zika virus, including within the United States, we have, to date, 
confirmed only 1 maternal Zika virus infection and identified no fetal or neonatal infections. 
In our increasingly mobile society, a patient’s primary location of residence appeared to be 
an uncommon source of potential Zika virus and we believe that our center’s experience is 
likely generalizable to patients across the United States, because patients are still likely to 
travel for work or pleasure as they would outside of pregnancy. Our center’s experience 
suggests that the majority of patients seen by obstetric providers in this country may be 
those who have been exposed to the Zika virus from short-term exposure secondary to travel, 
compared to those who have had long-term exposure (immigrants from endemic regions) or 
exposure from sexual contact. We believe that this represents a common scenario in most 
geographical regions of this country, and thus is generalizable, with the exception of certain 
regions in Florida and Texas that may continue to see patients with autochthonous infection.

 Recently, a report from the US Zika Pregnancy Registry reported a 6% rate of Zika virus-
related birth defects [21] among women with confirmed Zika virus infection. In contrast, our 
study focuses on screening a large cohort of potential Zika virus- exposed pregnant patients 
and demonstrates that overall risk of Zika virus infection after patient or partner travel to 
high-risk regions is low. These data may be helpful to clinicians who are expected to 
continue universal Zika virus-exposure screening for their pregnant patients.
Patients may be referred for the indication of potential Zika virus exposure during 
pregnancy. In these cases, a heightened suspicion may have an impact on prenatal 
ultrasounds, resulting in an increased suspicion and increased reporting for certain 
ultrasound markers as Zika virus- specific findings, as may have been the case in our series. 
However, all the patients in our series in whom initial ultrasounds were thought to carry 
potential findings ultimately had negative Zika virus test results and had resolution of those 
ultrasound findings prior to delivery.
Strengths of this study include the prospective nature of data collection and the strict 
adherence to CDC and SMFM guidelines as they evolved over time. To the best of the 
authors’ knowledge, this publication is one of the largest descriptions of screening and 
management of potentially Zika virus infected pregnant patients from one center. The wide 
range of travel exposures and the fact that the pattern of exposures is similar to those 
reported by the US Zika Pregnancy Registry, supports the generalizability of this study. We 
do recognize however, that this study is descriptive in nature and that conclusions regarding 
risk for fetal infection and neonatal outcomes cannot be made due to the study design and 
the low numbers of overall confirmed Zika virus infection.
Despite low rates of maternal infection and no cases of neonatal infection in our current 
cohort, as the outbreak continues to unfold, especially in potentially larger non-immune 
populations in the United States, clinicians need to be able to interpret and triage patient and 
physician concerns and to manage evaluation and testing in accordance with guidelines that 
are current at time of patient presentation or referral. In addition, the costs of screening 
sizeable populations of concerned, exposed patients who may ultimately have low rates of 
positive results raise issues regarding best use of limited resources. Until the latter part of 
this study period, however, testing was only available and performed in public laboratories, 
with no cost incurred by patients. As commercial testing became available, patients were 
offered both public and commercial options for Zika testing. However, essentially no 
patients opted for the lower cost public option when the lower turn around time factor for 
commercial laboratories was discussed, despite potential costs that could arise. These issues 
also need to be taken into account when counseling patients regarding testing. As the 
implications of perinatal Zika virus exposure and infection are consistently evolving, we 
found it to be particularly critical to be as current as possible through frequent referral and 
strict adherence to the evolving recommendations made by the CDC, in order to provide the 
most appropriate counseling and surveillance of Zika virus-exposed patients.
