Abstract
BACKGROUND—Intermittent treatment with sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine is widely 
recommended for the prevention of malaria in pregnant women in Africa. However, with the 
spread of resistance to sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine, new interventions are needed.
METHODS—We conducted a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial involving 300 human 
immuno-deficiency virus (HIV)–uninfected pregnant adolescents or women in Uganda, where 
sulfa-doxine–pyrimethamine resistance is widespread. We randomly assigned participants to a 
sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine regimen (106 participants), a three-dose dihydroartemisinin– 
piperaquine regimen (94 participants), or a monthly dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine regimen (100 
participants). The primary outcome was the prevalence of histopathologically confirmed placental 
malaria.
RESULTS—The prevalence of histopathologically confirmed placental malaria was significantly 
higher in the sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine group (50.0%) than in the three-dose 
dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine group (34.1%, P = 0.03) or the monthly dihydroartemisinin–
piperaquine group (27.1%, P = 0.001). The prevalence of a composite adverse birth outcome was 
lower in the monthly dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine group (9.2%) than in the sulfadoxine–
pyrimethamine group (18.6%, P = 0.05) or the three-dose dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine group

 (21.3%, P = 0.02). During pregnancy, the incidence of symptomatic malaria was significantly 
higher in the sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine group (41 episodes over 43.0 person-years at risk) than 
in the three-dose dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine group (12 episodes over 38.2 person-years at 
risk, P = 0.001) or the monthly dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine group (0 episodes over 42.3 
person-years at risk, P<0.001), as was the prevalence of parasitemia (40.5% in the sulfadoxine–
pyrimethamine group vs. 16.6% in the three-dose dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine group 
[P<0.001] and 5.2% in the monthly dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine group [P<0.001]). In each 
treatment group, the risk of vomiting after administration of any dose of the study agents was less 
than 0.4%, and there were no significant differences among the groups in the risk of adverse 
events.
CONCLUSIONS—The burden of malaria in pregnancy was significantly lower among 
adolescent girls or women who received intermittent preventive treatment with 
dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine than among those who received sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine, and 
monthly treatment with dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine was superior to three-dose 
dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine with regard to several outcomes. (Funded by the Eunice Kennedy 
Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development; ClinicalTrials.gov number, 
NCT02163447.)
In 2007, more than 30 million pregnancies were estimated to have occurred in areas of sub-
Saharan Africa in which Plasmodium falciparum is endemic.1 Malaria during pregnancy is 
associated with placental malaria, adverse birth outcomes, and complications and death in 
both the mother and the infant.2,3 In sub-Saharan Africa, malaria during pregnancy is 
estimated to be the cause of low birth weight in up to 20% of deliveries, leading to more 
than 100,000 infant deaths annually.2,3 Given the high burden of malaria in this vulnerable 
population, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the routine implementation 
of malaria-preventive measures among pregnant women in all countries in Africa in which P. 
falciparum remains endemic. These measures include the use of long-lasting insecticide–
treated bed nets and intermittent preventive treatment with sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine 
during pregnancy.4
Earlier studies have shown that intermittent preventive treatment with sulfadoxine–
pyrimethamine during pregnancy is effective at reducing the risk of placental malaria, low 
birth weight, and maternal illness.5-8 However, resistance to sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine has 
become widespread, especially in East Africa and southern Africa,9 and more recent studies 
have suggested that the effectiveness of this drug combination as intermittent preventive 
treatment during pregnancy may be compromised10-13; thus, there is a need for evaluation of 
alternatives to sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine for such treatment during pregnancy. Studies of 
amodiaquine and mefloquine have not shown convincing evidence of superior benefit, and 
these drugs were found to have more adverse side effects than sulfadoxine–
pyrimethamine.14,15
Artemisinin-based combination therapies have been shown to be effective for the treatment 
of malaria during pregnancy16,17; however, there are limited data evaluating such regimens 
for use as intermittent preventive treatment during pregnancy. Dihydroartemisinin–
piperaquine is an especially attractive combination therapy, given its prolonged post-

 treatment prophylactic effect.18 Here, we compare the efficacy and safety of three different 
regimens as intermittent preventive treatment during pregnancy — a regimen of 
sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine, a three-dose regimen of dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine, and a 
monthly regimen of dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine — among human immunodeficiency 
virus (HIV)–uninfected adolescent girls and women living in an area of Uganda in which the 
intensity of malaria transmission and the prevalence of sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine 
resistance are high.
Methods
Trial Setting, Participants, and Oversight
We conducted the trial in Tororo, Uganda, which is an area of high malaria-transmission 
intensity, with an estimated entomologic inoculation rate of 310 infectious bites per person-
year.19 Eligible participants were HIV-uninfected pregnant adolescents or women at least 16 
years of age (primigravid or multigravid), who were between 12 and 20 weeks of gestation, 
as confirmed by ultra-sonography. A complete list of the entry criteria is provided in the trial 
protocol, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. All trial participants 
provided written informed consent.
The trial was funded by the National Institutes of Health and approved by the ethics 
committees at Makerere University School of Biomedical Sciences, the Uganda National 
Council for Science and Technology, and the University of California, San Francisco. All the 
authors vouch for the completeness and accuracy of the data and analyses presented and for 
the fidelity of the trial to the protocol.
Trial Design and Randomization
This was a double-blind, randomized, three-group controlled trial comparing sulfadoxine–
pyrimetha-mine, three-dose dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine, and monthly 
dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine as intermittent preventive treatment for malaria in 
pregnancy. Randomization was performed in a 1:1:1 ratio in permuted blocks of 6 or 12. 
Pharmacists who were not otherwise involved in the trial were responsible for treatment 
assignment and the preparation of study agents. Six participants who were randomly 
assigned to receive three-dose dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine were treated with 
sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine because of a transcription error.
Each dose of sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine (tablets of 500 mg of sulfadoxine and 25 mg of 
pyrimethamine [Kamsidar, Kampala Pharmaceutical Industries]) consisted of three tablets 
taken together; doses were administered at three times during the pregnancy (the 
sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine group). Each dose of dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine (tablets of 
40 mg of dihydroartemisinin and 320 mg of piperaquine [Duo-Cotecxin, Holley-Cotec]) 
consisted of three tablets given once a day for 3 consecutive days; doses were administered 
either three times during the pregnancy (the three-dose dihydroartemisinin–piper-aquine 
group) or once per month (the monthly dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine group). Participants 
who were assigned to the sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine group or the three-dose 
dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine group received active study agents at 20, 28, and 36 weeks

 of gestation. Participants who were assigned to the monthly dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine 
group received active study agents every 4 weeks starting at 16 or 20 weeks of gestation. 
Placebos of sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine and dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine were used 
such that every 4 weeks, participants received the same number of pills with the same 
appearance. Administration of the first daily doses of active agents or placebo were directly 
observed in the clinic, and the second and third daily doses were administered at home. 
Additional details regarding the administration of the study agents are provided in the trial 
protocol.
Trial Procedures
At enrollment, participants received a net treated with long-lasting insecticide, underwent a 
standardized examination, and had blood samples collected. Participants received all their 
medical care at a study clinic that was open every day. Routine visits were scheduled every 4 
weeks and included collection of blood for dried blood spots to be used for future molecular 
testing; routine laboratory testing (complete blood count and measurement of alanine 
aminotransferase levels) was performed every 8 weeks. Participants were encouraged to 
come to the clinic any time they were ill. Those who presented with a documented fever 
(tympanic temperature, ≥38.0°C) or history of fever in the previous 24 hours had blood 
collected for a thick blood smear. If the smear was positive for parasites, malaria was 
diagnosed and treated with artemether–lumefantrine.
Participants were encouraged to deliver at the hospital adjacent to the study clinic. 
Participants who delivered at home were visited by trial staff at the time of delivery or as 
soon as possible afterward. At delivery, a standardized assessment was completed, including 
evaluation of the neonate for congenital anomalies, measurement of birth weight, and 
collection of biologic specimens, including placental tissue, placental blood, cord blood, and 
maternal blood. After delivery, participants were followed for 6 weeks. Adverse events were 
assessed and graded according to standardized criteria at every visit to the study clinic.20 
Electrocardiography was performed to assess corrected QT (QTc) intervals with the use of 
the Fridericia’s formula in 42 participants just before their first daily dose of study agents 
and 3 to 4 hours after their third daily dose of study agents when they reached 28 weeks of 
gestation.
Laboratory Procedures
Blood smears were collected from febrile participants during pregnancy and from placental, 
cord, and maternal blood at delivery. Blood smears were stained with 2% Giemsa and read 
by experienced laboratory technologists. A blood smear was considered to be negative when 
the examination of 100 high-power fields did not reveal asexual parasites. For quality 
control, all slides were read by a second microscopist, and a third reviewer was designated to 
settle any discrepancy between readings. The rate of agreement between the readers was 
98.6% (kappa, 0.96; P<0.001). Blood samples for dried blood spots were obtained from 
participants at enrollment and every 4 weeks during pregnancy, as well as from placental 
blood, cord blood, and maternal blood at delivery. Dried blood spots were tested for the 
presence of malaria parasites with the use of a loop-mediated isothermal amplification 
(LAMP) kit (Eiken Chemical), as described previously.21 Placental tissues were processed

 for histologic evidence of placental malaria as described previously.22 Histopathological 
slides were read in duplicate by two independent readers, and the results were recorded on a 
standardized case-record form; any discrepant results were resolved by a third reader. The 
rate of inter-reader agreement was 71.3% (kappa, 0.48; P<0.001). The readers were unaware 
of both the treatment assignment and the results of previous reads.
Trial Outcomes
The primary outcome was the prevalence of placental malaria, as assessed by the presence of 
any parasites or malaria pigment detected histopathologically. The histopathological 
assessment of placenta was also classified according to the standardized system developed 
by Rogerson et al.23 and according to whether moderate-to-high-grade pigment deposition 
was present (defined as pigment detected in ≥5% of high-power fields).24 Secondary 
outcomes included the incidence of symptomatic malaria; the prevalence of parasitemia 
assessed by means of LAMP; the prevalence of anemia (hemoglobin level, <11 g per 
deciliter) during pregnancy after the administration of the first dose of study agent; the 
prevalence of parasitemia at delivery assessed by means of microscopy and LAMP in 
samples of placental, cord, and maternal blood; and adverse birth outcomes, including 
spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, low birth weight (<2500 g), preterm delivery (<37 weeks), 
congenital anomaly, and a composite of any of these birth outcomes. For participants who 
gave birth to twins, the delivery outcomes were based on whether the outcome was present 
in either child or in the placenta. Measures of safety and side-effect profiles included the 
prevalence of vomiting after administration of study agents and the incidence of adverse 
events after the initiation of study agents through 6 weeks post partum.
Statistical Analysis
To test the hypothesis that the use of intermittent preventive treatment during pregnancy with 
either three-dose dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine or monthly dihydroartemisinin–
piperaquine would be associated with a lower risk of histopatho-logically confirmed 
placental malaria than that associated with sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine, we assumed a 
prevalence of placental malaria of 62% in the sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine group on the basis 
of previous data and calculated that a sample size of 300 would be required for the study to 
have 80% power to show a 33% lower prevalence with dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine, at a 
two-sided significance level of 0.05. Statistical analyses were performed with Stata software, 
version 12 (StataCorp). All analyses were performed in the modified intention-to-treat 
population, which included all participants who were randomly assigned to a treatment 
group and who had outcomes of interest that could be evaluated. Comparisons of simple 
proportions were made with the chi-square test or Fisher's exact test. Comparisons of 
proportions with repeated measures were made with generalized estimating equations, with 
the use of log-binomial regression and robust standard errors. Comparisons of incidence 
measures were made with a negative binomial regression model. All P values were two-
sided, and a P value of less than 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance.

 Results
Trial Participants and Follow-up
From June through October 2014, a total of 386 adolescent girls and women were screened, 
and 300 were enrolled and underwent randomization; 106 enrollees were assigned to the 
sulfa-doxine–pyrimethamine group, 94 to the three-dose dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine 
group, and 100 to the monthly dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine group (Fig. 1). The baseline 
characteristics were similar among the three treatment groups (Table 1). The mean age at 
enrollment was 22 years, 69% of the participants were enrolled at 16 weeks of gestation or 
earlier, 37% were primigravid, 87% reported owning a long-lasting insecticide–treated net, 
and 57% had malaria parasites detected by LAMP. A total of 289 participants (96.3%) were 
followed through delivery, and 282 (94.0%) had placental tissue collected for 
histopathological assessment (Fig. 1). Eight participants gave birth to twins; four of these 
twin births had dichorionic placentas.
Efficacy Outcomes
At delivery, the prevalence of any histopathologically confirmed placental malaria was 
significantly higher in the sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine group (50.0%) than in the three-dose 
dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine group (34.1%, P = 0.03) or the monthly 
dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine group (27.1%, P = 0.001) (Table 2). All 105 placentas that 
were positive for placental malaria had pigment in fibrin that was indicative of past 
infection, but only 7 had parasites indicative of concomitant active infection. The prevalence 
of moderate-to-high-grade pigment deposition was significantly higher in the sulfadoxine–
pyrimethamine group (33.7%) than in the three-dose dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine group 
(18.2%, P = 0.02) or the monthly dihydroartemisinin– piperaquine group (8.3%, P<0.001) 
(Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available at NEJM.org). When only primigravid 
participants were considered, the prevalence of any histologically confirmed placental 
malaria was similar among the three treatment groups, but the prevalence of moderate-to-
high-grade pigment deposition was significantly higher in the sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine 
group than in the monthly dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine group (55.6% vs. 20.6%, P = 
0.003). The prevalence of histopathologically confirmed placental malaria was much lower 
among multigravid participants than among primigravid participants, and among multigravid 
participants, the prevalence of any histopatho-logically confirmed placental malaria and 
moderate-to-high-grade pigment deposition was significantly higher in the sulfadoxine–
pyrimethamine group than in the three-dose dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine group or the 
monthly dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine group (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). 
Detection of malaria parasites by means of microscopy in placental and maternal blood was 
uncommon, with no significant differences among the treatment groups. However, detection 
of malaria parasites by LAMP in placental and maternal blood was significantly more 
common in the sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine group than in the three-dose 
dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine group or the monthly dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine 
group (Table 2).
A total of 72 adverse birth outcomes occurred in 47 participants (Table S2 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). Low birth weight was the most common adverse birth outcome

 (36 instances), followed by preterm delivery (24), congenital anomaly (6), stillbirth (3), and 
spontaneous abortion (3). There were no significant differences in individual birth outcomes 
among the treatment groups, but the risk of any adverse birth outcome was significantly 
lower in the monthly dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine group (9.2%) than in the three-dose 
dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine group (21.3%, P = 0.02); the risk was also lower in the 
monthly dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine group than that in the sulfa-doxine–pyrimethamine 
group (18.6%), but the difference was of borderline significance (P = 0.05) (Table 2). A full 
comparison of efficacy outcomes between the three-dose dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine 
group and the monthly dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine group is provided in Table S3 in the 
Supplementary Appendix.
After the initiation of treatment, the incidence of symptomatic malaria during pregnancy was 
significantly higher in the sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine group (41 episodes in 32 participants) 
than in the three-dose dihydroartemisinin– piperaquine group (12 episodes in 11 
participants, P = 0.001) or the monthly dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine group (0 episodes, 
P<0.001) (Table 2). The prevalence of parasitemia was also significantly higher in the 
sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine group (40.5%) than in the three-dose dihydroartemisinin–
piperaquine group (16.6%, P<0.001) or the monthly dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine group 
(5.2%, P<0.001) (Table 2 and Fig. 2). The risk of maternal anemia was significantly higher 
in the sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine group (34.9%) than in the monthly dihydroartemisinin–
piperaquine group (23.6%, P = 0.04), but it was not significantly higher than in the three-
dose dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine group (30.4%, P = 0.43) (Table 2).
Side Effects and Safety Outcomes
Overall, among all the treatment groups, vomiting occurred less than 0.2% of the time after 
administration of any dose of the study agents, with no significant differences among the 
treatment groups (Table 3). There were no significant differences in the incidence of any 
adverse events apart from dysphagia, which was more common in the monthly 
dihydroartemisinin– piperaquine group than in the three-dose dihydroartemisinin–
piperaquine group. All episodes of dysphagia were mild in severity, and we are not aware of 
any previous reports of dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine being associated with dysphagia. 
One grade 3 or 4 adverse event was thought by the investigators to be possibly related to the 
study agents: an episode of anemia that occurred after both the first and second doses of 
monthly dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine (study agents were subsequently withheld after the 
second dose) (Table 3). Among 42 participants who underwent electrocardiographic 
evaluation at 28 weeks of gestation, all pretreatment and post-treatment QTc intervals were 
within normal limits (≤450 msec), and no clinical adverse events consistent with 
cardiotoxicity occurred during the course of the study. The median change in QTc interval 
was greater in the three-dose dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine group (20 msec) and monthly 
dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine group (30 msec) than in the sulfa-doxine–pyrimethamine 
group (5 msec), but these differences were not significant (Table S4 in the Supplementary 
Appendix).

 Discussion
In this double-blind, randomized, controlled trial of intermittent preventive treatment of 
malaria during pregnancy, the burden of malaria during pregnancy in the sulfadoxine–
pyrimethamine group (the current standard of care) was almost 1 episode of symptomatic 
malaria per person-year, with a prevalence of parasitemia higher than 40% during pregnancy, 
a prevalence of histopathologically confirmed placental malaria of 50%, and a prevalence of 
any adverse birth outcome of almost 20%. The incidence of symptomatic malaria, the 
prevalence of parasitemia during pregnancy, and the prevalence of histopathologically 
confirmed placental malaria were lower in the group that received the three-dose 
dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine regimen and in the group that received the monthly 
dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine regimen than in the group that received the sulfadoxine–
pyrimethamine regimen. In addition, the risk of maternal anemia was lower — and the risk 
of any adverse birth outcome was marginally lower — in the monthly dihydroartemisinin–
piperaquine group than in the sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine group. Monthly 
dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine was associated with a lower incidence of symptomatic 
malaria, a lower prevalence of parasitemia during pregnancy, less moderate-to-high-grade 
placental pigment deposition, and a lower risk of any adverse birth outcome than was three-
dose dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine, which suggests that the efficacy of this drug 
combination is higher with more frequent dosing. All three treatment regimens were 
associated with a low risk of vomiting, and there were no clinically significant differences in 
the rates of adverse events.
The burden of malaria in the sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine group was not surprising, given the 
prevalence of molecular markers of sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine resistance in East 
Africa.9,25-27 Observational studies from East Africa suggested that the use of sulfadoxine–
pyrimethamine as intermittent preventive treatment during pregnancy provided minimal or 
no benefit,10,12,13 and in a randomized trial involving young Ugandan children, intermittent 
preventive treatment with monthly sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine provided no protection 
against malaria.28 A few controlled trials have evaluated alternatives to sulfadoxine–
pyrimethamine, including amodiaquine and mefloquine, for intermittent preventive 
treatment during pregnancy; however, they have not shown convincing evidence of higher 
efficacy, and the drugs had a poor side-effect profile.14,15
Dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine has been shown to be effective for the treatment of malaria 
in pregnant and nonpregnant populations29,30 and for the prevention of malaria in children 
and nonpregnant adults.28,31 In addition to our trial, one other trial has evaluated the use of 
dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine for the prevention of malaria in pregnancy in an area of 
western Kenya with high levels of resistance to sulfa-doxine–pyrimethamine.32 In that trial, 
HIV-uninfected pregnant women were randomly assigned to receive intermittent screening 
and treatment with dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine or intermittent preventive treatment with 
a median of three doses of either dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine or sulfadoxine–
pyrimethamine. Intermittent screening and treatment with dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine 
was not found to be a suitable alternative to intermittent treatment with sulfadoxine–
pyrimethamine; however, intermittent treatment with dihydroartemisinin– piperaquine was 
associated with a lower prevalence of malaria infection at delivery and a lower incidence of

 malaria infection and clinical malaria during pregnancy than was sulfadoxine– 
pyrimethamine. One of the strengths of our trial was the detailed longitudinal assessment of 
the risk of malaria during pregnancy and of the way in which effective intermittent 
preventive treatment during pregnancy affects outcomes assessed at delivery. At enrollment, 
almost 60% of the participants had evidence of asymptomatic parasitemia, which has been 
associated with an increased risk of placental malaria and adverse birth outcomes.33,34 
Dihydroartemisinin– piperaquine was associated with a lower risk of symptomatic malaria 
and parasitemia than was sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine, and treatment with 
dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine was therefore associated with a lower risk of placental 
malaria. Furthermore, the use of a higher frequency of dosing — every 4 weeks starting as 
early as 16 weeks of gestation (monthly dihydroartemisinin– piperaquine) rather than every 
8 weeks (three-dose dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine) — was associated with an even lower 
risk of malaria during pregnancy and therefore with a lower risk of moderate-to-high-grade 
pigment deposition and improvements in birth outcomes. However, among primigravid 
participants, who are at the highest risk for placental malaria, the risk of low-grade pigment 
deposition associated with monthly dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine was not lower than that 
associated with the other two regimens; this suggests the need for effective preventive 
measures as early in pregnancy as possible.
Safety and side effects are important considerations when preventive drugs are being 
evaluated for routine use during pregnancy. In this trial, no clinically important differences 
in the risk of adverse events were observed among the treatment groups. Indeed, in a large 
systematic review, no safety concerns were identified in association with 
dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine when it is administered for the treatment of malaria and 
when it is given monthly for the prevention of malaria in young children and 
adults.28,29,31,35 Dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine has been shown to cause prolongation of 
the QTc interval,36; however, in the limited number of participants in whom the QTc interval 
was evaluated in this trial, dihydroartemisinin– piperaquine was not associated with any 
clinically significant prolongation of the QTc interval.
In summary, in a high-transmission setting with widespread resistance to sulfadoxine–
pyrimethamine, intermittent preventive treatment with dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine 
during pregnancy resulted in a lower burden of malaria than did treatment with sulfadoxine–
pyrimethamine. The use of a higher dosing frequency of dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine 
(every 4 weeks starting as early as 16 weeks of gestation) provided more protection, which 
is in line with updated WHO policy recommendations that intermittent preventive treatment 
in pregnancy should be given at every antenatal clinic visit if visits are at least 1 month 
apart.4 Additional and larger evaluations in different settings are needed to inform im portant 
questions regarding safety and the potential risks for selection of drug-resistant parasites as a 
result of an increase in drug pressure.

 Figure 2. Prevalence of Parasitemia during Pregnancy, According to Week of Gestation
The data at 16 weeks include only participants who were enrolled on or before this time 
point (207 adolescent girls or women). For the SP and three-dose DP groups, active drug 
was given at weeks 20, 28, and 36, and place bo was given at weeks 16, 24, 32, and 40. The 
prevalence of parasitemia was assessed by means of loop-mediated isothermal amplification 
(LAMP).
