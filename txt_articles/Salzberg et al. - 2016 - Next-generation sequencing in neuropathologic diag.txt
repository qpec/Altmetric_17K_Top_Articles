Next-generation sequencing in
neuropathologic diagnosis of infections of
the nervous system
ABSTRACT
Objective: To determine the feasibility of next-generation sequencing (NGS) microbiome ap-
proaches in the diagnosis of infectious disorders in brain or spinal cord biopsies in patients with
suspected CNS infections.
Methods: In a prospective pilot study, we applied NGS in combination with a new computational
analysis pipeline to detect the presence of pathogenic microbes in brain or spinal cord biopsies
from 10 patients with neurologic problems indicating possible infection but for whom conven-
tional clinical and microbiology studies yielded negative or inconclusive results.
Results: Direct DNA and RNA sequencing of brain tissue biopsies generated 8.3 million to 29.1
million sequence reads per sample, which successfully identified with high confidence the infec-
tious agent in 3 patients for whom validation techniques confirmed the pathogens identified by
NGS. Although NGS was unable to identify with precision infectious agents in the remaining
cases, it contributed to the understanding of neuropathologic processes in 5 others, demonstrat-
ing the power of large-scale unbiased sequencing as a novel diagnostic tool. Clinical outcomes
were consistent with the findings yielded by NGS on the presence or absence of an infectious
pathogenic process in 8 of 10 cases, and were noncontributory in the remaining 2.
Conclusions: NGS-guided metagenomic studies of brain, spinal cord, or meningeal biopsies offer
the possibility for dramatic improvements in our ability to detect (or rule out) a wide range of CNS
pathogens, with potential benefits in speed, sensitivity, and cost. NGS-based microbiome ap-
proaches present a major new opportunity to investigate the potential role of infectious patho-
gens in the pathogenesis of neuroinflammatory disorders. Neurol Neuroimmunol Neuroinflamm

Ascertainment of the etiology of inflammatory disorders of the CNS represents a major chal-
lenge in the clinical setting, as more than 50% of cases go undiagnosed.1 Next-generation
sequencing (NGS) and metagenomics present a major new opportunity to investigate the
potential role of infection in the pathogenesis of neuroinflammatory disorders. This technology
can provide a view of the transcriptome of the host tissue as well as capture microbial genomes
(i.e., bacteria, fungi, and viruses) that reside in the tissue niche.2–4 Until recently, most sequence-
based pathogen identification studies have focused on targeted capture of the 16S rRNA gene
that is exclusive to prokaryotes. Deep sequencing of total DNA or RNA provides an unbiased
approach that can detect even rare components of the microbiome.5 This strategy has recently
been used to diagnose cases of encephalitis and meningitis by known and novel pathogens,6–15

 but other than these isolated cases, the utility
of NGS for clinical or pathologic diagnosis has
yet to be established.
We report a pilot prospective study of the
use of unbiased NGS to assist in the evaluation
of brain biopsies in a series of patients with
neuroinflammatory disorders suspected to be
associated with infections. We applied NGS
and a new computational analysis pipeline
for identifying pathogen species based on short
NGS reads, as short as 100 base pairs (bp) in
length.16
METHODS Patients, biopsy handling, and sequencing.
CNS tissues were obtained prospectively from biopsies performed
during diagnostic assessment of 10 patients with neuroinflamma-
tory disorders (table 1). Fresh frozen tissues from 8 cases were
sequenced immediately after biopsy and 2 other samples were from
paraffin-processed tissues (e-Methods at Neurology.org/nn).
Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient
consents. All biopsy tissues were obtained from a biosample
repository approved by The Johns Hopkins University School
of Medicine Institutional Review Board.
Computational processing. All reads were run through the
Kraken system,16 which compared them to a database containing
the human genome (version GRCh38.p2), 2,817 bacterial ge-
nomes (representing 891 distinct species), 4,383 viral genomes
(2,963 species), and 26 genomes of eukaryotic pathogens. The
total size of the Kraken database in this study was 97 gigabytes.
Each Kraken report was analyzed separately, and reads matching
potential causative agents (bacteria or viruses) were extracted from
the sequence file and realigned using the more sensitive BLAST17
aligner against the comprehensive NCBI nucleotide database (nt),
which contains many thousands of draft genomes and partial
sequences in addition to the finished genomes in the custom
Kraken database used here. In all cases, computational analysts
were blinded to all pathology results until the analysis was com-
plete, and in most cases NGS analysis was conducted in parallel
with pathologic studies. Only reads whose best BLAST matches
hit the same species were considered further. Reads that hit dif-
ferent species were considered uninformative and were excluded
from further analysis. For all of the positive diagnoses reported
here, the BLAST results confirmed the species identified by Kra-
ken, although the best-matching strain was sometimes a different
(draft) genome (see e-Methods for additional details). All
nonhuman reads have been deposited in the NCBI Sequence
Read Archive under project PRJNA314149.
RESULTS Sequencing data. The sequenced biopsies
(appendix e-1) generated between 8.3 and 29.1 million
reads per sample (table 1). The vast majority of reads in
all cases were human, as expected (because the human
genome is approximately 1,000 times larger than most
bacterial genomes, a mixture with equal numbers of
human and bacterial cells will yield 99.9% human
DNA). After filtering to remove common contami-
nants and vector sequences, we then ranked the micro-
bial species and considered only those that ranked
among the top 3 species as possible infectious agents

 (figure 1). The number of bacterial and viral reads
varied from fewer than 20 to 25,000. NGS successfully
identified with high confidence the infectious agent in
3 out of 10 patients. In 2 cases the NGS cases were
indeterminate and the other remaining 5 patients had
negative or nonspecific findings, which further sup-
ported the conclusion that the disease process was
not associated with active infection. In 2 cases, diag-
noses of noninfectious processes (e.g., gliomas) were
identified by pathology.
Cases with a high degree of diagnostic confidence and
positive pathogen identification. Patient PT-8 (pathogen:
Mycobacterium tuberculosis). A 67-year-old woman with
osteomyelitis
and
lung
disease
presented
with
multifocal brain and spinal lesions (appendix e-2).
Brain MRI showed progression of multiple nodular
enhancing lesions throughout the brain (figure 2).
Biopsies from a perilesional (S1) and a nodular
brain lesion (S2) were obtained for pathology,
microbiology,
and
NGS
studies.
Two
DNA
sequencing runs yielded 15 M reads from sample
S1 and 14 M reads from sample S2. These runs
yielded the fewest microbial reads of any of the
patients in our study: 18 and 22 bacterial reads, and
only 1 to 6 viral and fungal reads, respectively, for
samples S1 and S2. Nonetheless, a clear finding
emerged
for
sample
S2:
15
reads
from
M
tuberculosis. Despite the small absolute number of
reads, this species explained 68% of the bacterial
reads
detected.
We
manually
confirmed
the
sequence assignments using BLAST17 to align them
against the NCBI nt database. We then realigned all
reads against one specific genome, M tuberculosis
7199-99 (accession NC_020089.1), using Bowtie2
with
sensitive
local
alignment
settings.18
This
procedure yielded 34 reads that were randomly
distributed along the M tuberculosis genome.
Pathology studies of the corresponding S2 sample
showed
necrotizing
granulomas
although
microbiologic
studies
failed
to
identify
any
microorganism (figure 2). The patient responded
rapidly to antituberculous treatment.
Patient PT-5 (pathogen: JC polyomavirus [JCV]). A 52-
year-old man had been admitted for evaluation of
lower extremity weakness, right hemiparesis, and
a simple partial motor seizure. A brain MRI showed
a left postcentral frontal cortical and white matter
lesion (figure 3A). PCR CSF studies for viruses
and bacterial cultures were negative although a pre-
biopsy CSF PCR was reported inconclusive or low
DNA levels for JCV. A biopsy of the lesion under-
went RNA sequencing, which yielded 26.9 million
reads, of which 25.9 million were human (appendix
e-1). Analysis found JCV with 8,944 out of 8,954
reads from all viruses. Although many bacterial spe-
cies were detected, JCV was the most abundant spe-
cies in terms of the number of reads, despite its small
genome size. The whole genome of JCV was covered
by the reads, at an average depth over 200
(figure 3B). The sequence data supported the diag-
nosis of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy
(PML).19 Pathology results showed marked astro-
gliosis and intranuclear inclusions in oligodendro-
cytes (figure 3C) and positive immunostaining for
SV40 T antigen (a surrogate for JCV), confirming
the diagnosis (figure 3D).
Patient PT-10 (pathogen: Epstein-Barr virus [EBV]). A
44-year-old woman with a history of organ trans-
plants and immunosuppression presented with facial
paralysis. Brain MRI showed at least 3 enhancing le-
sions in both hemispheres, one of them with appear-
ance of a ring-enhancing lesion, which resembled
CNS toxoplasmosis (figure 4, A–C). Assessment of
CSF for known opportunistic infections was negative
as well as CSF flow cytometry for malignancies.
Biopsy of one lesion showed granulomatous, lympho-
histocytic inflammation and focal necrosis (figure
4D). Paraffin sections were processed for NGS, which
yielded 21.3 million reads (table 1), of which 21
million were human and ;216,000 were vector or
synthetic controls. Only 569 reads were bacteria, all
matching known skin bacteria or contaminants.
Twenty reads matched viruses, of which 18 (90%)
matched EBV. A validation test using in situ hybrid-
ization for EBV-encoded RNA confirmed EBV infec-
tion (figure 4E).
Cases with indeterminate pathogen identification (not
confirmed by a second method). Patient PT-2 with
a Tolosa-Hunt-like syndrome and focal pachymeningitis. A
69-year-old man developed left-sided ptosis and

by decreased vision, diplopia, ophthalmoplegia, and

syndrome and treated with dexamethasone. Brain
MRIs demonstrated pachymeningeal enhancement
localized in the medial aspect of the left middle
cranial fossae, left cavernous sinus, and adjacent
structures (figure 5A), which worsened over time
despite steroid treatment. A biopsy of the dural
and skull base mass showed chronic inflammation
and fibrosis (figure 5C). Microbiologic studies were
negative. NGS studies of the dura biopsy were
indeterminate although a high proportion of Delftia
acidovorans (or possibly Chryseobacterium taeanense,
which is very closely related to Delftia) and

tions. (B) Diagrammatic representation of the time profile for biopsy processing for neuropathology and next-generation

to demonstrate infectious pathogens. NGS diagnosis was established 7 days after biopsy, confirming the presence of
Mycobacterium tuberculosis, a finding that was used to support the treatment with antituberculous medication and ruled
out the presence of Nocardia infection. (C) Histologic demonstration of granulomatous inflammation in hematoxylin & eosin

 Corynebacterium kroppenstedtii reads were seen, higher
(45% of nonhuman and noncontaminant reads) than
in any other patient (appendix e-2). Although Delftia
might have been a contaminant, a combination
of antibiotic treatments produced clinical improvement
and decreased dural enhancement in brain MRI
(figure 5B). It was concluded that the pachymeningeal
reaction was possibly associated with a chronic
evolving infection possibly triggered by cataract
surgery and intraocular lens implantation although no
confirmatory studies were obtained to link the potential
role of Delftia or other bacteria in the pathogenesis of
pachymeningitis.
Patient PT-7 (Fanconi anemia, neurodevelopmental dis-
order, and cerebritis). A 19-year-old man developed
new-onset right-sided weakness and seizures. A brain
MRI demonstrated a left-sided brain mass (figure e-1)
and a brain biopsy suggested the diagnosis of lym-
phoma. He was treated with IV and intrathecal dexa-
methasone via an Ommaya reservoir. The patient
deteriorated clinically and was transferred to our insti-
tution. A second biopsy of the brain lesion showed
chronic inflammation (figure e-1) and coagulative
necrosis.
Microbiological
studies
were
negative.
NGS analysis of the biopsy did not reveal a clear
candidate, but did show an unusually high presence
of Lactococcus lactis, a common additive in dairy prod-
ucts that rarely causes human infections. A total of
244 reads mapped to the genus Lactococcus, 201 of
which were specific to L lactis cremoris.
However, 1 year later (March 2016), re-analysis of
this patient’s data revealed 429 reads from Elizabeth-
kingia, a newly emerging pathogen that caused signif-
icant morbidity in a cluster of cases in Wisconsin.20
No more than 2 reads from this species were detected
in any other sample. The genomes for this species
were unavailable at the time of the original analysis,
but 3 genomes are now available: E sp BM10,
E anophelis NUHP1, and E meningoseptica FMS-007.
The greatest number of matches in this sample was to
E sp BM10.
Cases with nonspecific or negative findings that were
clinically useful. Sequencing yielded no specific find-
ings to support a diagnosis of infection in 5 cases
(table 1). In case PT-3, a 23-year-old woman with
status epilepticus following a febrile illness was
diagnosed with febrile infection-related epilepsy
syndrome (FIRES),21 after extensive microbiologic
and NGS studies were negative for pathogens. In

 cases
PT-4
and
PT-9,
suspected
to
have
granulomatous inflammation or sarcoidosis based
on brain MRI and biopsy findings, NGS showed
no
evidence
of
specific
infection.
Subsequent
steroid treatment was associated with improvement
in both cases. In 2 cases, neuropathologic studies
demonstrated that the disease process was associated
with glial tumors despite initial concerns about
infections. In 1 patient, PT-6, DNA sequencing
identified 15 viral reads mapped to JCV, a finding
considered to be incidental, although JCV has been
implicated in the pathogenesis of astrocytomas in
nonhuman primates.22
DISCUSSION We describe the power of large-scale
unbiased
sequencing
along
with
computational
analysis as a diagnostic tool to establish the presence
or absence of active infection in brain biopsies from
patients with neuroinflammatory disorders suspected
to be associated with pathogenic microorganisms.
With
current
technology,
the
minimum
time
required for sequencing is approximately 1 day, with
initial analysis requiring less than an hour after the
sequencing
is
complete.
The
current
clinical
standards for neuropathologic diagnosis of infections,
which
include
histologic,
immunologic,
and
selected molecular techniques (e.g., PCR, 16S
rRNA, in situ hybridization), have limited power
even when specific neurologic infectious disorders
are suspected.
In our study, NGS facilitated the identification of
a pathogenic agent in 3 patients for whom the pres-
ence of such agent was further validated by immuno-
histologic or molecular techniques. In these 5
patients, standard diagnostic studies had failed to
define etiologic agents. In case PT-8, in which M
tuberculosis was identified by NGS, the findings of
sequencing studies along with brain pathology fea-
tures of necrotizing granuloma supported treatment
that led to clinical improvement. Similarly in cases
PT-5 and PT-10, the confidence in the findings of
JCV and EBV was strengthened by immunocyto-
chemical and in situ hybridization techniques, which
further supported the finding of a pathogenic role of
these viruses. Although PCR studies for EBV and
JCV in CSF are well-established in clinical practice,

 there are specific clinical situations in which brain
biopsies are required. For example, the presence of
EBV DNA in CSF of immunocompromised patients
should be interpreted with caution as EBV may coex-
ist with other opportunistic infections.23 In case PT-
10, for which CSF PCR studies were negative, the
finding of EBV by NGS validated by EBV-encoded
RNA in situ hybridization helped to establish a diagno-
sis of EBV-associated encephalitis and also counter-
acted the brain MRI evidence, which was suggestive
of toxoplasmosis. This case shows many similarities to
a previous report24 of EBV-induced brain lesions in
a patient following organ transplantation. Similarly,
the value of metagenomic sequencing in the diagnosis
of PT-5 was demonstrated by the inconclusiveness of 2
prebiopsy qualitative JCV-PCR studies in CSF.
Although pathology and PCR techniques might have
helped to establish the diagnosis of PML, case PT-5
represents a good proof-of-concept that NGS studies
are useful and may provide better characterization of
the JCV genome for prognosis purposes.25,26
Although a high degree of certainty could not be
achieved in some cases, NGS provided information
that facilitated a better understanding of the high or
low likelihood of CNS infection in the other 5 pa-
tients. In 2 cases, NGS findings were considered
indeterminate as suspected microorganisms fre-
quently seen as contaminants were identified
although their pathogenic role could not be con-
firmed by histology, cultures, or direct pathogen
visualization. In these 2 patients, the metagenomic
analysis yielded a high number of reads of bacteria
frequently recognized as environmental contami-
nants such as D acidovorans and C kroppenstedtii
(PT-2), normal commensals of skin, and L lactis
cremoris and Elizabethkingia (PT-7). Although
these bacteria might had entered the CNS by sur-
gical procedures such as ophthalmologic surgery
(PT-2) and Ommaya reservoir (PT-7), the valida-
tion that these assumed contaminants were patho-
genic
organisms
by
other
microbiologic
or
morphologic methods was difficult to obtain, for
which the NGS findings were considered indeter-
minate. Although these environmental contami-
nants have been associated with neuropathologic
conditions27–29 and outbreak of illness,20 our find-
ings expose one of the limitations in the interpre-
tation of NGS, in that the demonstration that these
presumed contaminants were pathogenic organ-
isms would require a detailed validation approach
to prove pathogenicity.
Whereas microbiome analysis of brain biopsies
was able to identify definite or possible pathogenic
microorganisms in 5 of 10 cases, no pathogenic spe-
cies were identified in the other 5 cases. Negative
NGS studies may help support a finding that a brain
infection is not present, although the negative pre-
dictive value of sequencing assays is not yet known.
In case PT-3, the failure to demonstrate a pathogen
helped to determine her neurologic disorder was
most likely associated with FIRES, a rare condition
of uncertain etiology in which infection is sus-
pected.21 In another 2 cases, PT-4 and PT-9, NGS
showed no clear evidence of pathogenic microorgan-
isms associated with the granulomatous inflamma-
tion
noted
on
brain
biopsies.
We
therefore
determined there was no active infection, a finding
that was further supported by the beneficial effect of
steroid treatment. These 2 cases demonstrate the
way in which negative NGS findings may help clini-
cians to decrease concerns about an active infection,
as the presence of granulomatous inflammation
always raises concerns about the presence of atypical
bacteria, mycobacteria, or fungal infections in which
the use of steroids would be deleterious. Clearly,
microbiome analysis of brain tissues has limitations,
and the absence of pathogenic microorganisms
should be interpreted with caution. It is possible that
the timing or site of the brain biopsy may not coin-
cide with the period of active infection, and thus

 inflammatory
changes
could
represent
reactive
immune responses to an earlier or nearby infection.
Negative NGS studies in patients with neuroinflam-
matory diseases may also suggest the cause of such
disorders is due to postinfectious or autoimmune
inflammatory
responses
rather
than
an
active
infection.
Sequence-based results for patients in whom NGS
studies were negative or inconclusive, as well as in
cases supporting specific diagnoses, contained com-
mon skin bacteria and other contaminants that were
not considered clinically relevant (appendix e-1).
While we cannot rule out these species as pathogens,
their presence in multiple samples collected from dif-
ferent patients widely spaced apart in time indicates
that they are not likely to be causally related to the pa-
tients’ symptoms. For example, we observed the skin
bacterium Propionibacterium acnes in almost all sam-
ples, illustrating the difficulty of capturing a pure
sample without any microbial spillover from the
intervening tissues. These findings illustrate the diffi-
culty and complexity of identifying pathogens in
human samples, which unavoidably contain some
bacterial species because the human body is not a ster-
ile environment and brain biopsies are obtained via
skin incision, which is colonized with multiple bac-
teria.30 In addition, surgical procedures that include
the use of irrigation solutions, biopsy handling, as
well as processing methods (e.g., DNA extraction kits
and other sequencing reagents) often contain bacterial
DNA that may be captured by NGS methods espe-
cially when the concentration of microbial DNA is
low.31
An important limitation of computational analysis
in microbiome studies is the size and completeness of
genome sequence databases. Although thousands of
bacterial and viral species have been sequenced, many
others including human pathogens may yet be discov-
ered, and unknown pathogens cannot be detected
until their genomes are sequenced. Eukaryotic patho-
gens represent a larger challenge: many of these
remain to be sequenced, and even those that have
been sequenced are available only in draft form, with
many gaps and errors in the publicly available
genomes.
We described here the power of large-scale unbi-
ased sequencing along with computational-based
metagenomic analysis in the study of brain biopsies.
Our study opens the possibility for more extensive
use of NGS techniques in the identification of patho-
gens in patients with suspected CNS infections or
neuroinflammatory disorders.
