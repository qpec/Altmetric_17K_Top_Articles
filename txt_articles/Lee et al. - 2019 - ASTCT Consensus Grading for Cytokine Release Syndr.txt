Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy is rapidly emerging as one of the most promising therapies for hemato-
logic malignancies. Two CAR T products were recently approved in the United States and Europe for the treatment
of patients up to age 25 years with relapsed or refractory B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and/or adults with large B
cell lymphoma. Many more CAR T products, as well as other immunotherapies, including various immune cell- and bi-
specific antibody-based approaches that function by activation of immune effector cells, are in clinical development for
both hematologic and solid tumor malignancies. These therapies are associated with unique toxicities of cytokine release
syndrome (CRS) and neurologic toxicity. The assessment and grading of these toxicities vary considerably across clinical
trials and across institutions, making it difficult to compare the safety of different products and hindering the ability to
develop optimal strategies for management of these toxicities. Moreover, some aspects of these grading systems can be
challenging to implement across centers. Therefore, in an effort to harmonize the definitions and grading systems for CRS
and neurotoxicity, experts from all aspects of the field met on June 20 and 21, 2018, at a meeting supported by the Amer-
ican Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (ASTCT; formerly American Society for Blood and Marrow Trans-
plantation, ASBMT) in Arlington, VA. Here we report the consensus recommendations of that group and propose new
definitions and grading for CRS and neurotoxicity that are objective, easy to apply, and ultimately more accurately catego-
rize the severity of these toxicities. The goal is to provide a uniform consensus grading system for CRS and neurotoxicity
associated with immune effector cell therapies, for use across clinical trials and in the postapproval clinical setting.

 INTRODUCTION
Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapies are revolu-
tionizing the management of B cell leukemias and lymphomas
and are quickly being extended to numerous other malignancies.
Two CD19 CAR T cell products were recently approved in the
United States and Europe [1-4], and more indications are expected
in the coming years. Tisagenlecleucel has been approved for mul-
tiply relapsed or refractory B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia
(ALL) in patients up to age 25 years, as well as for relapsed or
refractory large B cell lymphoma in adults, and axicabtagene cilo-
leucel has been approved for relapsed or refractory large B cell
lymphoma in adults. These therapies are now being tested in ear-
lier lines of treatment, signaling the growing scope of CAR therapy
in the management of these diseases. CAR therapies targeting
CD22 in B cell malignancies [5] and B cell maturation antigen
(BCMA) in multiple myeloma [6] have been highly successful
in early trials and are also forthcoming, along with combination
approaches targeting multiple antigens simultaneously.
Early clinical trials of CD19 CAR T cells quickly uncovered
greater toxicities than those seen in other cellular therapies, indi-
cating profound and generalized immune system activation.
Some of these toxicities, especially cytokine release syndrome
(CRS), were reminiscent of those seen in a study in which all 6
healthy young male volunteers who received a low dose of
TGN1412 (a superagonist monoclonal antibody to CD28) required
critical care for the rapid onset of multiorgan failure [7]. Symp-
toms induced by TGN1412 included fever, rigors, hypotension
requiring vasopressor support and other aggressive management,
tachycardia, hypoxia, respiratory failure, capillary leak, acute kid-
ney injury, coagulopathy, and even neurologic manifestations,
including poor concentration and delirium. Retrospective analysis
revealed marked elevations in C-reactive protein (CRP), INF-g,
TNF-a, IL-6, IL-10, IL-2, and IL-1b, among other cytokines.
Although all volunteers eventually recovered with the use of
high-dose methylprednisolone, the IL-2 receptor antagonist dacli-
zumab, and aggressive supportive care, the rapidity and severity
of the toxicities precluded further development of TGN1412.
Similar toxicities were observed in the initial patients treated
with CD19 CAR T cells. In the first pediatric ALL patient treated
[8,9], it became clear that supraphysiologic cytokine elevation was
responsible for the vast majority of symptoms, suggesting that
these toxicities were the result of CRS. Investigators struggled with
the then-accepted definition of and grading scheme for CRS. In the
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3
(CTCAE v3 [10]), which was in effect when many of these studies
began, CRS onset was defined as within 24 hours of initiation of
therapy, which is atypical for CRS associated with CAR T cells as
well as other immune effector cell therapies. In CTCAE v4.03 [11]
(Table 1), the definition did not include fever as a prerequisite for
CRS, and the grading was dependent in part on whether the drug
infusion was interrupted, a feature not applicable to CAR T cells,
which generally are infused in a single dose in a concise time frame
(2 to 30 minutes). Indeed, CTCAE v4.03 was more applicable to tox-
icity seen with antibody infusions rather than with cell infusions.
Without a clear and accurate consensus available, CRS grad-
ing has varied widely among institutions and has evolved over
time, making toxicity comparisons between products and trials
exceedingly difficult. For these reasons, and because immune
effector cell-associated CRS can be fatal if not recognized and
treated promptly, a CRS grading system that more accurately
captures the potentially severe syndrome observed after
immune effector cell therapies is needed. In addition, this CRS
grading system should have broad applicability across multiple
institutions and/or CAR products and other cellular immuno-
therapies with minimal effort for implementation.
Along with CRS, another common toxicity observed after CAR
T cell therapy is neurotoxicity [12]. Immune effector cell-associ-
ated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) may manifest as delirium,
encephalopathy, aphasia, lethargy, difficulty concentrating, agita-
tion, tremor, seizures, and, rarely, cerebral edema. In addition,
headache is very common and might not represent neurotoxicity
per se. Previously considered in aggregate with CRS, neurotoxic-
ity is now treated as a separate entity owing to its distinct timing
and response to intervention. Neurologic symptoms may occur
during or more commonly after CRS symptoms (but rarely before
CRS), vary among patients, and have an unclear pathophysiology,
distinct from CRS. One challenge has been to identify the symp-
toms most relevant to neurotoxicity. Investigators have used
multiple different terms for similar symptomatology, resulting in
considerable variation in grading across trials and also across dif-
ferent institutions within the same trial. For example, a patient
experiencing encephalopathy after CAR T cell therapy may be
reported as having any or a combination of the following
vague, overlapping CTCAE adverse event terms: confusion,
delirium, encephalopathy, cognitive disturbance, concentration
impairment, somnolence, and depressed level of consciousness
[13]. Ascertainment has changed over time and even within trials
as the issue of neurotoxicity has become more apparent. More-
over, CTCAE grading of neurologic toxicities based on the ability
to perform instrumental and self-care activities of daily living are
not always applicable to children or for hospitalized adult CAR T
patients who may be bedridden for related comorbidities. The
multiple adverse event terms used to grade neurologic toxicities
are also not practical for application at the bedside for rapid and
dynamic assessment of patients, so discerning the appropriate
terms is difficult and often highly subjective. Therefore, there is a
need for an objective, reproducible, easy-to-use, and practicable
tool that can be used by all health care providers and possibly
caregivers to recognize and assess immune effector cell-associ-
ated neurologic toxicities in the inpatient or outpatient setting.
INITIAL ATTEMPTS TO BETTER DEFINE AND GRADE CRS
Although early clinical trials modified the CTCAE v4.03 grad-
ing of CRS, further refinement was achieved when a multi-insti-
tutional group of pediatric oncologists leading CAR T cell trials
across the United States published what is now commonly
referred to as the Lee criteria [14]. This work redefined the clini-
cal signs and symptoms associated with CRS (Table 1). Of note,
neurologic toxicities such as confusion, delirium, aphasia, and so
on were included but are now generally accepted to be a separate
syndrome (although cytokines have been implicated in the path-
ophysiology of this syndrome), owing to the differential time of
presentation compared to the other signs of CRS and lack of
knowledge surrounding its etiology and pathophysiology. The
new constellation of symptoms incorporated the experience
across CAR T studies in hematologic malignancies and included,
for the first time, fever as a hallmark of CRS.
Lee and colleagues then redefined the grading criteria for
CRS revolving around hypoxia requiring oxygen supplementa-
tion, hypotension, and other end-organ toxicities (Table 1)
[14]. In contradistinction to conventional CTCAE grading
schemes, hypotension responsive to low-dose vasopressors
was considered a grade 2 CRS. Early experience demonstrated
that reliance on i.v. fluids (IVF) alone to manage persistent
hypotension was inferior to early vasopressor use owing to sig-
nificant capillary leak and subsequent pulmonary edema and
effusions after IVF management, leading to a cascade of events
that can quickly result in life-threatening toxicity. Further-
more, patients who are easily managed with minimal vaso-
pressors are decidedly distinct in terms of CRS severity from
626
D.W. Lee et al. / Biol Blood Marrow Transplant 25 (2019) 625�638
 those who require high-dose or multiple vasopressors, a key
difference accounted for by the grading criteria.
Likewise, the grading schema distinguished between
those patients who require minimal oxygen supplementa-
tion and those who require aggressive supplementation or
continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) support. A frac-
tion of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40% was arbitrarily chosen
as the dividing line between grade 2 and grade 3 CRS. This
aspect of the definition is problematic, however, because
delivery of oxygen to patients [14] will vary significantly
from hospital to hospital, from patient to patient, and from
shift to shift. Similar to patients requiring low-dose versus
aggressive vasopressor support, patients requiring minimal
oxygen supplementation are distinct in terms of severity
from those who require more aggressive intervention, rang-
ing from CPAP to intubation.

 OTHER GRADING SCHEMES FOR CRS
The Lee criteria have been widely adopted by many CAR T
cell groups, in particular because it was the first to link a spe-
cific grade to a suggested treatment algorithm. The group at
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) identified
objective factors that distinguished severe versus nonsevere
CRS in their early clinical trials; however, this relies on the
availability of serum cytokine levels in patients in real time
[15]. Recognizing that assays for serum cytokines are not readily
available at most centers, thereby limiting the utility of this
approach, MSKCC redefined the CRS grading used in their clini-
cal trials (Table 1) [16]. Hypotension requiring <24 hours of
vasopressor use was deemed grade 2, whereas �24 hours of
vasopressor use defines grade 3, and hypotension not corrected
with high-dose vasopressor within 3 hours defines grade 4.
Hypoxia also contributes to CRS grading, with a required FiO2 of
40% serving as the demarcating line between grade 2 and grade
3. Intubation triggers grade 4, but there is no mention of other
methods of delivering positive pressure, such as CPAP.
The University of Pennsylvania published a grading scale that
has been used in their CD19 CAR T cell trials (Penn criteria;
Table 1) [17]. In contrast to the Lee criteria, the Penn criteria
assign the same grade 3 CRS to patients requiring any amount of
IVF for hypotension and patients requiring low-dose vasopres-
sors, and to patients requiring minimal oxygen supplementation
and those requiring more aggressive support, including CPAP.
Owing to these differences and the inclusion of neutropenic
fever as a trigger for grade 2 CRS, the Penn criteria tend to assign
a higher grade of CRS compared with the Lee criteria, hindering
comparisons of clinical trial safety data across centers.
Most recently, a multi-institutional group of investigators
on several industry-sponsored CAR T cell trials published a
manuscript on CAR toxicity (CARTOX) grading and manage-
ment of CRS and CAR-associated neurotoxicity [12]. The CAR-
TOX CRS grading differs slightly from the Lee criteria by
including grade 1 organ toxicity to be considered under grade
1 CRS and defining fever, hypotension, and hypoxia for grading
of CRS in adults (Table 1). In addition, a separate system was
proposed for grading of neurotoxicity. Differences among the
Penn, MSKCC, CARTOX, and Lee approaches to managing CRS
are outside the scope of the present discussion.
EFFORTS TO HARMONIZE IMMUNE EFFECTOR CELL-
ASSOCIATED CRS AND NEUROTOXICITY DEFINITIONS AND
GRADING
Recognizing the disparity in published grading schemes and
the need for harmonization of definitions and grading systems
for immune effector cell-associated CRS and neurotoxicities seen
after immune effector cell therapies including CAR T therapy, 49
experts from all aspects of the field met in Arlington, VA on June
20-21, 2018, at a meeting supported by the American Society for
Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (ASTCT; formerly American
Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation, ASBMT). Attend-
ees included leaders from major academic centers involved in
CAR T cell therapy research as well as representatives from indus-
try, the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant
Research (CIBMTR), the American Society of Hematology (ASH),
and the National Cancer Institute (NCI). Key presentations regard-
ing immune effector cell-associated CRS and neurotoxicity were
followed by focused discussion of salient points. The writing
group was then tasked with generating language encompassing
a new consensus that is both easily applied at the bedside and
easily verifiable during chart reviews. A full, iterative drafting and
vetting process was undertaken. In addition, these guidelines
were presented at the CIBMTR CT Registry Forum on October 25,
2018, for discussion and comment. The participation at this sec-
ond meeting included a broad group of multiple stakeholders
including investigators, industry, payors, and National Institutes
of Health and other governmental agencies. Here we report the
consensus and rationale of the group as related to grading and
reporting of toxicities.
IS CYTOKINE RELEASE SYNDROME THE APPROPRIATE TERM
FOR IMMUNE EFFECTOR CELL-ASSOCIATED TOXICITY?
We first discussed whether “cytokine release syndrome” is
the most appropriate term to assign to the constellation of
symptoms occurring after CAR T cell and other immune effec-
tor cell therapies. The pathophysiology of the syndrome is
unclear, because no animal models of CRS existed until
recently [18,19]. In patients, most CD19 CAR T cell clinical trials
to date have found marked inflammatory cytokine elevations
in association with the onset of symptomatology and degree of
severity. In addition, rapid clinical stabilization is frequently
seen with use of the IL-6 receptor antagonist tocilizumab,
strongly implicating cytokines, especially IL-6 [8,20-22], in the
pathophysiology of the syndrome. In the absence of data sug-
gesting an alternative mechanism, we conclude that CRS is the
most appropriate term for these immune effector cell-associ-
ated symptoms and signs. We recognize that as CAR T and
other immune effector cell therapies are successfully adapted
to treat both hematologic malignancies and solid tumors, addi-
tional or alternative mechanisms of toxicity may be found.
DEFINITION OF CRS
The CTCAE v4.03 defines CRS as “a disorder characterized
by nausea, headache, tachycardia, hypotension, rash, and
shortness of breath; it is caused by the release of cytokines
from the cells [11].” Although inclusive of many of the features
of immune effector cell-associated CRS, this definition does not
include fever, the hallmark of immune effector cell-associated
CRS. CTCAE v5.0 refined the definition as “a disorder character-
ized by fever, tachypnea, headache, tachycardia, hypotension,
rash, and/or hypoxia caused by the release of cytokines [13].”
Although this list of associated symptoms is more in line with
what is seen clinically during immune effector cell-associated
CRS, this definition limits the cause to cytokines alone and is
not contextually defined. For example, in bacterial sepsis, high
levels of many cytokines are produced, and symptoms such as
fever and hypotension overlap with CRS, but there is no infec-
tion and the overall clinical picture is distinctly different from
immune effector cell-associated CRS.
It is also important to note that CRS is observed not just
with CAR T and other immune effector cell therapies. In addi-
tion to the TGN1412 experience, it has been described in many
patients treated with blinatumomab, a bi-specific T cell engag-
ing molecule consisting of 2 covalently linked single chain
antibody fragments targeting CD3 on T cells and CD19 on nor-
mal and malignant B cells [23,24]. Preclinical studies suggest
that CRS could be observed with CAR NK cell therapy as well
[25]. Because the same constellation of symptoms has been
observed after treatment with multiple agents each working in
different ways to activate T and/or other immune effector cells,
CRS as we have described it appears to be an immune effector
cell-associated phenomenon. Therefore, we define CRS as “a
supraphysiologic response following any immune therapy that
results in the activation or engagement of endogenous or
infused T cells and/or other immune effector cells. Symptoms
can be progressive, must include fever at the onset, and may
include hypotension, capillary leak (hypoxia) and end organ
dysfunction.” CRS should be applied to any immune effector
628
D.W. Lee et al. / Biol Blood Marrow Transplant 25 (2019) 625�638
 cell-engaging therapy, not just with CAR T cells. Cytokine pro-
files with other therapies might not be the same, and this may
have therapeutic implications. As new, effective immunothera-
pies centered around cell types other than T cells are devel-
oped, the definition may need to be altered.
SYMPTOMS DEFINING CRS MUST BE ATTRIBUTED TO
IMMUNE EFFECTOR CELL ENGAGEMENT
The common symptoms of CRS are not unique to CRS.
Indeed, practitioners must be cautious and exclude other
causes of fever, hypotension, hemodynamic instability, and/or
respiratory distress, such as an overwhelming infection. Bac-
teremia and other infections have been reported concurrent
with and even mistaken for CRS. A reasonable temporal rela-
tionship to the cell therapy must be present. Although immune
effector cell-associated CRS may have a delayed onset, it rarely
presents beyond 14 days after initiation of therapy. Patients
exhibiting symptoms consistent with CRS presenting outside
this window should be carefully evaluated for other causes.
TOXICITIES EXCLUDED FROM THE DEFINITION OF CRS
As stated before, neurotoxicity is a frequent complication of
CAR T cell and other T cell-engaging therapies. Unlike the clas-
sic symptoms of CRS, immune effector cell-associated neuro-
toxicities do not usually respond to tocilizumab, which is not
surprising given the observation that i.v. tocilizumab adminis-
tration does not generate significant levels of the drug in the
cerebrospinal fluid [26]. Given this finding, along with the pau-
city of mechanistic data, the lack of known CD19 expression in
the CNS, and the propensity for neurotoxicities to develop well
after the classic symptoms of CRS have resolved, we conclude
that immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicities should be
excluded from the definition of CRS.
Despite this, CRS can impact neurotoxicity and complicate
its assessment. High fever and drug therapy can cause delir-
ium. A sedated and/or intubated patient might not be assess-
able for neurotoxicity. As more insight is gained, this may need
to be reevaluated. In the meantime, we recommend the use of
a separate grading scale for immune effector cell-associated
neurotoxicities as described below.
Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis or macrophage acti-
vation syndrome (HLH/MAS) overlaps substantially with CRS,
as illustrated by ferritin elevations seen in many CAR T cell
recipients during CRS [2,12,20,22,27]. CRS and classic acquired
HLH/MAS have many shared features, and the 2 entities likely
are not distinct, reflecting the activation of the reticuloendo-
thelial system initiated by T cell-mediated inflammation. Most
patients with moderate to severe CRS have laboratory results
that meet the classic criteria for HLH/MAS but may or may not
have hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, or overt evi-
dence of hemophagocytosis. In addition, refractory HLH/MAS
has been described only in rare cases of immune effector cell-
associated CRS [2,28], whereas in the vast majority of patients,
the symptoms (and characteristic elevated cytokines) sugges-
tive of HLH/MAS resolve with CRS resolution [22]. Given this
overlap, and the absence of a need to directly treat HLH/MAS
in most cases, we conclude that HLH/MAS should be excluded
from the definition of CRS. Patients may meet some of the cri-
teria for HLH/MAS after CAR T cell infusion, but this is part of
the CRS. Because of the inability to separate CRS from HLH/
MAS, and because grading of HLH/MAS is not available as a
separate CTCAE term, the group did not see a need to grade
this entity separately.
LABORATORY PARAMETERS ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE
DEFINITION OR GRADING OF CRS
Significant alterations in many laboratory parameters
clearly occur with CRS. Cytokine aberrations have been well
described, but such data are not routinely available in most
academic centers in a time frame that is useful for assigning
grade and planning management of a patient experiencing
CRS. CRP is a widely available and relatively inexpensive labo-
ratory test and initially appeared to be a useful biomarker of
CRS. However, CRP is not specific for CRS, several scales of
measurement exist, and our experience suggests that changes
in CRP lag behind clinical changes by at least 12 hours. For
these reasons, although CRP is often used to follow inflamma-
tion, we excluded the use of laboratory parameters from the
definition and grading of CRS and favor a system based on clin-
ical observation; however, we do encourage the continued
measurement of cytokines, CRP, ferritin, and other parameters
so that additional data may be generated for future study.
IMPLICATIONS OF A GRADING SYSTEM BASED ON
PRACTITIONER INTERVENTION
Hospitals have varying capacities and policies for providing
escalating care to their patients experiencing serious complica-
tions. Our proposed schema separates grade of CRS based
largely on the degree or type of intervention administered to a
patient, for example, i.v. fluid versus vasopressor use for man-
aging hypotension or admission to the intensive care unit.
There are several circumstances (eg, % oxygen supplementa-
tion; see below) in which strict definitions are confounded by
wide variability in clinical practice. In the end, many defini-
tions in use reflect the treatment decisions made by the clinical
team at the bedside. There was some concern that some practi-
tioners might alter their usual practice and rely longer on i.v.
fluids for hypotension and/or delay transfer to the intensive
care unit in an effort to prevent upgrading a patient. Such a
practice is not the intent of the grading system and is strongly
discouraged, given that prolonged fluid resuscitation without
pressor use is associated with worse outcome and because
early and aggressive supportive care, early use of vasopressors,
and timely anti-cytokine therapy are paramount to mitigating
life-threatening CRS.
CONSENSUS ON CRS GRADING
Grade 1 CRS
We define grade 1 CRS as fever (�38.0°C) with or without
constitutional symptoms (Table 2). The associated constitu-
tional symptoms may be reported in accordance with CTCAE
v5.0 but do not affect CRS grade. All CRS grading schemes pro-
posed to date mostly agree on what constitutes grade 1 CRS;
however, not all systems include fever as a requirement. The
constitutional symptoms of CRS, such as myalgia, arthralgia,
and malaise, are by themselves nonspecific; however, when
coincident with fever in the expected timeframe, the etiology
of CRS is more likely.
Grade 2 CRS
We define grade 2 CRS as fever (�38.0°C) with hypotension
not requiring vasopressors and/or hypoxia requiring the use of
oxygen delivered by low-flow nasal cannula (�6 L/minute) or
blow-by. Lee et al [14] attempted to separate grading for patients
who require minimal vasopressor support from those that
require intensive vasopressor use (also a feature of the Penn
grading) and those requiring minimal oxygen supplementation

629
 from those requiring more aggressive assistance. This was done
in part out of concern that intervening with anticytokine therapy
such as tocilizumab, as well as early, prolonged, or high-dose cor-
ticosteroids, would abrogate the antitumor response. Although
prospective clinical trials evaluating the timing of intervention
are lacking, retrospective analyses suggest that this is not the
case, at least when such therapies are implemented after CRS is
well under way [2,21]. How the use of preemptive or prophylac-
tic tocilizumab or corticosteroids affect the antitumor response
or alter the natural history of other immune effector cell-associ-
ated toxicities, such as neurotoxicity, remains an open question
that merits further exploration in well-controlled studies.
The trend in many groups has been to move toward the use
of anticytokine therapy earlier in the development of severe
CRS rather than later. For example, many investigators will
administer tocilizumab with any vasopressor requirement,
even low-dose, or with a significant oxygen requirement, rep-
resenting a shift in the treatment algorithm initially proposed
by Lee et al [12,14], as well as much of the early Penn experi-
ence. In general, we agree with this approach because it ini-
tiates CRS management earlier, allowing for earlier resolution
while still preserving efficacy. We also differentiate this prac-
tice shift from the prophylactic or preemptive use of tocilizu-
mab, which remains experimental. Nonetheless, the goal of the
work was to define a grading system, and the group clearly
recognized the reality of and need for variations in practice in
initiating and escalating CRS treatment.
Despite this shift toward earlier intervention, we recognize
there is a distinct difference between patients requiring low-
dose vasopressor or minimal oxygen supplementation and
those who require more aggressive interventions. We sought to
capture this difference in our CRS grading scheme, because sig-
nificantly less resources are needed to support the former com-
pared with the latter. Our scheme is also aligned with the
general concept in the CTCAE that toxicities requiring specific
intervention (eg, anticytokine therapy) meet the criteria for
grade 3 at least. However, it is important to recognize that fever
might not always be present concurrently with hypotension or
hypoxia because it may be masked by such interventions as
antipyretics,
anticytokine
therapy,
and/or
corticosteroids,
whereas hypotension and hypoxia may take longer to resolve.
Grade 3 CRS
We define grade 3 CRS as fever (�38.0°C) with hypotension
requiring 1 vasopressor with or without vasopressin and/or
hypoxia requiring high-flow nasal cannula (>6 L/minute), face-
mask, nonrebreather mask, or venturi mask not attributable to
any other cause. Several key features of these criteria merit
discussion.
The Lee and Penn criteria relied on established definitions of
low-dose versus high-dose vasopressor use in defining lower-
grade versus higher-grade CRS [14,17]. Although these defini-
tions are well accepted in the critical care literature, they are
cumbersome in practice when assigning or auditing CRS grade.
The MSKCC criteria used duration of any vasopressor dose for
less than or greater than 24 hours as differentiating between
grades 2 and 3 CRS [16]; however, that arbitrary time point
might not accurately distinguish patients requiring minimal
versus significant critical care support. As a result, and owing to
real differences in severity between patients requiring 1 vaso-
pressor versus 2 or more vasopressors, we use this distinction
(1 versus �2 vasopressors) in our proposed grading system.
Many
critical care
practitioners
administer
vasopressin
simultaneously with any dose of norepinephrine to capitalize on
its vasoconstrictive effects in an effort to mitigate capillary leak
and minimize norepinephrine dose requirements. The use of
vasopressin in this setting is not in response to escalating toxic-
ity, so our grading scheme is agnostic to its use. There was also
discussion regarding the inotrope milrinone, which is often used
to aid in contractility and does not escalate the grade of CRS.
Although previous versions of CRS grading relied on captur-
ing the FiO2 value required to maintain normoxia, this data
point can fluctuate from hour to hour, making interpretation
and auditing data difficult. To remedy this problem, we elected
to separate grade of CRS due to hypoxia by the device used to
deliver oxygen; for example, a simple, low-flow nasal cannula
(�6 L/minute) is considered grade 2, whereas high-flow devi-
ces are grade 3. This distinction serves as a surrogate for the
severity of oxygenation deficit.
What constitutes hypoxia—or, more accurately, what
oxygen saturation is sufficiently low or what clinical signs
are
sufficient
to
warrant
supplemental
oxygen—varies
widely across centers, among nursing practice, and accord-
ing to patient age. Normalizing all centers to a single set of
criteria is an exceedingly difficult task. For similar reasons,
we cannot dictate criteria for which supplemental oxygen
is no longer needed in all situations. Therefore, we allow
practitioner discretion and recommend that grading be
determined
by
the
minimal
oxygen
delivery
device
required to correct the perceived deficit(s).
Grade 4 CRS
We define grade 4 CRS as fever (�38.0°C) with hypotension
requiring multiple vasopressors (excluding vasopressin) and/

Organ toxicities associated with CRS may be graded according to CTCAE v5.0 but they do not influence CRS grading.
* Fever is defined as temperature �38°C not attributable to any other cause. In patients who have CRS then receive antipyretic or anticytokine therapy such as toci-
lizumab or steroids, fever is no longer required to grade subsequent CRS severity. In this case, CRS grading is driven by hypotension and/or hypoxia.
y CRS grade is determined by the more severe event: hypotension or hypoxia not attributable to any other cause. For example, a patient with temperature of 39.5°
C, hypotension requiring 1 vasopressor, and hypoxia requiring low-flow nasal cannula is classified as grade 3 CRS.
z Low-flow nasal cannula is defined as oxygen delivered at �6 L/minute. Low flow also includes blow-by oxygen delivery, sometimes used in pediatrics. High-flow
nasal cannula is defined as oxygen delivered at >6 L/minute.

 or hypoxia requiring positive pressure (eg, CPAP, bilevel posi-
tive airway pressure, intubation, mechanical ventilation) not
attributable to any other cause. Irrespective of total cumulative
dose, the use of multiple vasopressors constitutes grade 4 CRS.
An exception for vasopressin is again made, based on the fore-
going reasoning. Outside of vasopressin, adding a second agent
is a strong indication that the patient remains hemodynami-
cally unstable after the first intervention. Such a scenario
would be consistent with grade 4 CRS.
As CRS progresses, capillary leak often leads to pulmonary
edema and impairment of ventilation in addition to oxygen-
ation. These patients tend to respond to positive pressure ven-
tilation, which may be accomplished in several ways, up to
and including intubation and mechanical ventilation. Any use
of positive-pressure ventilation constitutes a grade 4 CRS.
Intubation may be indicated in patients who have a degree
of neurotoxicity where there is concern for their ability to main-
tain a patent airway. This may occur either in the setting of CRS
or after CRS has resolved. The severity of the neurotoxicity driv-
ing the decision for intubation will be captured by the grading
of that neurotoxicity and should not be captured again as a
grade 4 CRS when the other criteria for such are not met. In
other words, intubation of a patient without hypoxia for the
possible neurologic compromise of a patent airway alone or for
a procedure is not, by definition, grade 4 CRS. By extension, a
patient experiencing seizures in which a compromised airway
affects oxygenation and intubation reverses such deficits is not
considered to have grade 4 CRS, because the seizure rather than
CRS is the cause of the hypoxia. Furthermore, a patient who
remains intubated for a neurologic cause is not considered to
have CRS when the other signs of CRS have resolved.
Grade 5 CRS
By convention, grade 5 CRS is defined as death due to CRS in
which another cause is not the principle factor leading to this
outcome.
CRS SEVERITY IS DETERMINED BY HYPOTENSION AND
HYPOXIA
The clinical manifestations of CRS are varied and frequently
involve multiple organ systems. Arrhythmia, cardiomyopathy,
prolonged QTc, heart block, renal failure, pleural effusions,
transaminitis, and coagulopathy are but a few of the significant
complications of CRS. Although it is important to document all
adverse events experienced by CAR T cell recipients, we deter-
mined that such significant events are uncommon in the
absence of significant hypotension, hypoxia, or both. More-
over, these organ dysfunctions are usually managed symptom-
atically in accordance with standard guidelines and do not
influence the decision to use CRS-specific interventions, such
as anticytokine therapy and corticosteroids. Thus, hypotension
and hypoxia are the principle determinants of our consensus
grading scale. For these reasons, and to simplify reporting,
references to other specific organ toxicities have been removed
from CRS grading. However, organ toxicities associated with
CRS may be graded according to CTCAE (currently v5.0) and
reported as required.
DEFINITION OF FEVER, HYPOTENSION, AND HYPOXIA AS
RELATED TO CRS GRADING
Fever is defined in the CTCAE v5.0 as “a disorder character-
ized by elevation of the body’s temperature above the upper
limit of normal,” and a temperature �38.0 °C is considered
grade 1 fever [13]. We propose to use this same definition to
define fever associated with CRS.
The CARTOX criteria defined hypotension as a systolic
blood pressure (SBP) <90 mmHg in adults, whereas other CRS
grading
scales
did
not
specifically
define
hypotension
[11-14,17]. However, an SBP of 80 to 90 mmHg is considered
normal in many children. We also noted that some base the
definition of hypotension on SBP, whereas others consider
only the mean arterial pressure (MAP). Both are acceptable
and can be used to determine CRS grade. Therefore, hypoten-
sion should be determined on a case-by-case basis, accounting
for age and the patient’s individual baseline. Indeed, hypoten-
sion is defined in CTCAE v5.0 as “a disorder characterized by a
blood pressure that is below the normal expected for an indi-
vidual in a given environment” [13]. For practical purposes of
CRS grading, an individual requiring IVF boluses or vasopres-
sors to maintain normal blood pressure may be considered to
have hypotension.
Hypoxia is another term that is not defined consistently.
The CTCAE v5.0 defines hypoxia as “a disorder characterized
by a decrease in the level of oxygen in the body [13],” but does
not specifically define what level of decrease is considered
abnormal or even how to measure it. In fact, most physicians
cannot agree. Many consider hypoxia as an oxygen saturation
(SaO2) <94% or even 88%, whereas others base it on other
measurements, such as the partial pressure of arterial oxygen.
For CRS grading, an individual requiring supplemental oxygen
to correct a deficit in oxygenation is considered to have hyp-
oxia. Oxygen provided only as a comfort measure should not
be used to inform CRS grade.
DEFINITION OF CRS RESOLUTION
Although most centers are comfortable defining the onset
and grade of CRS at its presentation, there is less clarity about
when CRS is considered resolved. This is due in large part to
anticytokine therapies that dramatically and effectively treat
fever. Temperature often normalizes within a few hours after
tocilizumab administration, whereas the other components of
CRS take longer to resolve. Our definition and grading of CRS
require fever. Anticytokine therapies are indicated only for
patients with CRS, that is, patients who have fever and meet
the definition of CRS. Once such therapies are used, the patient
is considered to still have CRS, even in the absence of fever,
until all signs and symptoms leading to the diagnosis of CRS
have resolved. Likewise, CRS can be downgraded in an afebrile
patient treated with anticytokine therapy as their hemody-
namic status and/or hypoxia improves. Typically, a patient
with severe CRS in whom fever, oxygen, and pressor require-
ments have resolved may be assumed to have resolved CRS
unless there are alternative causes for the fever, hypoxia, and/
or hypotension. Any neurotoxicity occurring concurrent with
or subsequent to the period of CRS does not inform the grade
of CRS but is instead captured separately in the neurotoxicity
scale.
SYMPTOMS OF ICANS
Symptoms of ICANS (Table 3) have come into better focus
through early clinical trials and to date have generally been
graded using CTCAE. Although symptoms can be more diverse
than those of CRS, many patients with neurotoxicity have a
stereotypic evolution of a specific set of symptoms. The earliest
manifestations of ICANS are tremor, dysgraphia, mild difficulty
with
expressive
speech
(especially
in
naming
objects),
impaired attention, apraxia, and mild lethargy. Headache is a
nonspecific symptom, frequently occurring during fever or
after chemotherapy in patients without other neurologic dys-
function. Thus, headache alone is not a useful marker of ICANS.
D.W. Lee et al. / Biol Blood Marrow Transplant 25 (2019) 625�638
631
 Expressive aphasia, on the other hand, appears to be a very
specific symptom of ICANS. A Phase I clinical trial identified
expressive aphasia as the most characteristic feature, develop-
ing in 19 of 22 patients who went on to develop severe neuro-
toxicity [29]. Expressive aphasia, starting as impaired naming
of objects, paraphasic errors, hesitant speech, and verbal per-
severation, may progress to global aphasia, characterized by
expressive and receptive difficulty. Patients with global apha-
sia may appear wide awake but are mute and unable to follow
commands (akinetic). Many patients have myoclonus or
tremor and increased tone. There may be depressed level of
consciousness with mild lethargy progressing to obtundation,
stupor, or even coma. Mild symptoms may wax and wane with
fever initially only to recur a few days later after CRS has
resolved.
The tempo of progression to severe neurotoxicity may be
hours or days. Subclinical electrographic or clinical seizures may
then develop, accompanied in some cases by motor weakness.
When seizures occur, it is often after the development of severe
(global) aphasia. In rare cases, diffuse cerebral edema develops,
in some cases after seizures have occurred, but more often cere-
bral edema may have fulminant onset and few antecedent clini-
cal warning signs, suggesting that it may have a distinct
pathophysiology from more reversible neurotoxicity. There
appears to be variability in the presentation of neurotoxicity
with
different
CAR
products.
Nevertheless,
there
has
been progress toward understanding and defining relevant signs
and symptoms of neurotoxicity in the progression toward severe
toxicity that might trigger intervention in the acute setting.
DEFINITION OF ICANS
Neurologic symptoms may be observed in association with
pathological processes including hepatic failure, severe hyper-
tension, eclampsia, infection, electrolyte abnormalities, and
immunosuppressive and cytotoxic drug therapies. ICANS may
have features that overlap with other encephalopathies but
has the more specific characteristic of an awake patient who is
mute and does not respond verbally or physically to an exam-
iner. ICANS may have a unique pathophysiology compared
with
other
encephalopathies.
In
a
recent
report,
Gust
et al [30] suggested a role for endothelial activation and
blood-brain barrier disruption in the pathophysiology of
neurotoxicity. Another report found elevated levels of the
excitatory NMDA receptor agonists glutamate and quinolinic
acid in cerebrospinal fluid from patients with neurotoxicity
[26]. Several reports suggest a role for proinflammatory cyto-
kines and myeloid cells besides activated T cells [2,18,29,31-
33]. The term CAR-related encephalopathy syndrome (CRES)
has been proposed to describe neurotoxicity associated with
CAR T cell therapy [12]. We acknowledge that encephalopathy
is a dominant feature of the neurologic changes that occur;
however, we prefer the term ICANS to be inclusive of other
symptoms, as well as to acknowledge other cellular immuno-
therapies and therapeutics, such as bispecific antibodies, that
may have similar neurologic side effects. We define ICANS as
“a disorder characterized by a pathologic process involving the
central nervous system following any immune therapy that
results in the activation or engagement of endogenous or
infused T cells and/or other immune effector cells. Symptoms
or signs can be progressive and may include aphasia, altered
level of consciousness, impairment of cognitive skills, motor
weakness, seizures, and cerebral edema.” Similar to CRS, ICANS
should be applied to any immune effector cell engaging ther-
apy, not just CAR T cells.
SYMPTOMS AND SIGNS EXCLUDED FROM THE DEFINITION
OF ICANS
Although other neurologic symptoms and/or signs, such as
headache, tremor, myoclonus, asterixis, and hallucinations,
may occur and possibly be attributable to immune effector
cell-engaging therapies, we have excluded them from the defi-
nition of neurotoxicity because they are less specific, are usu-
ally managed symptomatically, and do not trigger specific
interventions, such as corticosteroids, to abrogate activation of
T cells and other immune cells. Weakness and balance prob-
lems may occur owing to deconditioning and loss of muscle
mass from immobility and are frequently seen in the trans-
plantation
and
intensive
chemotherapy
setting
and
are
excluded from the definition of ICANS. Intracranial hemor-
rhage with or without associated edema may occur due to coa-
gulopathies in these patients and is also excluded. We
recommend that practitioners capture and report such associ-
ated events in accordance with CTCAE v5.0 [13].
CONSENSUS ON ICANS GRADING FOR ADULTS
Although early clinical trials used CTCAE v4.03 for grading
neurotoxicity, further refinement was achieved when a multi-
institutional group of oncologists leading CAR T cell trials
across the United States published the CARTOX criteria for
adults on grading of neurotoxicity. The CARTOX system grades
neurotoxicity by assessing multiple neurologic domains that
span the constellation of signs and symptoms associated with
neurotoxicity (Table 4). An important development was a 10-
point screening tool called the CARTOX-10, which incorpo-
rated key elements of the Mini-Mental State Examination
(MMSE) to evaluate the alterations in speech, orientation,

 handwriting, and concentration that are highly suggestive of
the encephalopathy observed in patients with ICANS (Table 5).
This screening tool was designed to overcome the subjectivity
in grading many overlapping encephalopathy terms, such as
encephalopathy, delirium, aphasia, confusion, and others. It
moved away from defining the grade of encephalopathy
according to impairment of ability to perform activities of daily
living, which can be difficult to assess in hospitalized patients.
The
CARTOX
grading
system
for
neurotoxicity
also
included evaluation of other domains including level of con-
sciousness, motor symptoms, seizures, and signs of elevated
intracranial pressure (ICP) (Table 4). For evaluation of raised
ICP and determination of neurotoxicity grade, the guidelines
suggested
using
elevated
cerebrospinal
fluid
opening
pressure and papilledema grade by the Fris�
en Scale (Table 4).
Unfortunately, these measurements are cumbersome, poten-
tially inaccurate, and difficult to extend to routine practice.
For example, lumbar puncture can be difficult to perform in
critically ill patients, and when it is done, opening pressure
may vary with age, body habitus, positioning, systemic blood
pressure, mechanical ventilation, and pharmacologic sedation
[34]. In the case of papilledema grading, hospitals have differ-
ing capacities for rapid grading of papilledema, leading to var-
iable grading (Fris�
en grade
2 versus 3) depending on
the individual performing the examination, use of fundus
photography, and other factors.
For our consensus grading scheme, we propose the use of a
slightly modified version of the CARTOX-10 screening tool,

 here termed the Immune Effector Cell-Associated Encephalop-
athy (ICE) score, to provide objectivity for the grading of multi-
ple overlapping encephalopathy terms currently included in
the approved CAR T products (Table 3). The updated encepha-
lopathy screening tool (Table 5) includes an element for assess-
ing the receptive aphasia seen in these patients. The total
number of points, ease of administration, and categorization of
scores remain the same as in the original CARTOX-10 [12]. It is
important to note that the 10-point ICE screening tool is help-
ful for assessing patients for encephalopathy; however, the
grading of ICANS requires assessment of the 10-point ICE score
as well as evaluation of other neurologic domains, such as level
of consciousness, motor symptoms, seizures, and signs of ele-
vated ICP/cerebral edema, which may occur with or without
encephalopathy.
In contrast to CTCAE v4.03, in which a generalized seizure
was considered grade 2, our consensus guidelines are more
aligned with CTCAE v5.0, which considers a new seizure of any
type as grade 3 and any life-threatening seizure as grade 4.
Compared with the original CARTOX CRES grading and CTCAE
v5.0, the new consensus grading has been simplified so that a
single clinical or subclinical electrographic seizure of any type
is grade 3 and prolonged or repetitive clinical or subclinical
electrographic
seizures
without
a
return
to
baseline
in
between are grade 4 (Table 6). Patients may have electroen-
cephalography changes, such as generalized or frontal slowing
or frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity, which should
not be considered seizures.
We have also modified the criteria for assessment of ele-
vated ICP to improve the ease of grading compared with the
CARTOX CRES grading system by reducing cerebrospinal fluid
opening pressure and the requirement to grade papilledema
on the modified Fris�
en scale [35] (Table 6). This does not
negate the importance of making a clinical assessment to
determine the presence of elevated ICP, but acknowledges that
other signs and symptoms, including simply the presence or
absence of papilledema taken in conjunction with depressed
level of consciousness, can be used to make this assessment.
We have highlighted the importance of evaluating level of con-
sciousness by making it a more detailed factor in the grading.

 In the grading system, the final ICANS grade is determined
by the most severe event among the different domains.
Grade 1 ICANS
We define grade 1 ICANS as a score of 7 to 9 on the ICE
assessment (Table 6). A patient with grade 1 ICANS may have a
delay in response or disorientation to time or place, mild inat-
tention with difficulty in counting numbers backward, or
impaired handwriting. There may be drowsiness but the
patient awakens spontaneously, and when prompted, the
patient should be able to complete most of the ICE assessment.
Grade 1 ICANS may be seen during CRS waxing and waning
with febrile episodes.
Grade 2 ICANS
We define grade 2 ICANS as a score of 3 to 6 on the ICE
assessment (Table 6). Patients with grade 2 ICANS often have
some expressive aphasia, limiting the ability to communicate
spontaneously. Patients also may have difficulty writing a stan-
dard sentence due to poor handwriting and apraxia. They have
difficulty naming objects due to expressive aphasia and/or fol-
lowing commands due to receptive aphasia and poor concentra-
tion. In our experience, expressive aphasia is the most specific
first sign of severe neurotoxicity, and early signs in grade 2
include paraphasic errors (the production of unintended sylla-
bles and words during attempts to speak) and verbal persevera-
tion (repeating the same words over and over). Patients with
grade 2 ICANS are able to communicate their needs with effort.
Patients may have a depressed level of consciousness but are
arousable to voice and the responses may be slowed.
Grade 3 ICANS
We define grade 3 ICANS as a score of 0 to 2 on the ICE
assessment (Table 6). Patients with grade 3 ICANS have severe
global aphasia and do not speak or follow commands even
when wide awake and thus may be unable to answer any of the
ICE questions. Alternatively, they may have excessive drowsi-
ness and need tactile stimulus to attend to the examiner. Any
clinical seizure, whether simple partial, complex partial, or
generalized, and any electrographic seizures would also meet
the criteria for grade 3 ICANS (Table 6). This acknowledges that
seizure may be the peak of an excitatory neurotoxicity process
that first manifests clinically as progressive aphasia and then
peaks with onset of a clinical or electrographic seizure. If neuro-
imaging shows new focal or local edema, this would also be cat-
egorized as grade 3 ICANS (Table 6). However, intracranial
hemorrhage due to coagulopathy or other causes with or with-
out associated edema is not considered a neurotoxic feature and
is excluded from ICANS grading.
Grade 4 ICANS
We define Grade 4 ICANS as patients who have a score of 0
on the ICE assessment due to being unarousable and unable to
perform the ICE assessment. Stupor and coma may be seen;
the stuporous patient responds only by grimacing or drawing
away from vigorous or repetitive tactile stimuli, and the coma-
tose patient is unarousable and/or unresponsive (Table 6). This
depressed level of consciousness should be attributable to no
other cause (eg, no sedating medication), which is often a com-
plicating factor in sick patients with CRS. Some patients may
require intubation for airway protection. In addition, any
patient experiencing prolonged or repetitive clinical or sub-
clinical electrographic seizures without a return to baseline in
between or with deep focal motor weakness, such as hemipa-
resis or paraparesis, would be considered to have grade 4
ICANS (Table 6). Patients with symptoms and signs of elevated
ICP, such as projectile vomiting with headache; depressed con-
sciousness; cranial nerve VI palsies; papilledema; Cushing's
triad of bradycardia, hypertension, and respiratory depression;
decerebrate or decorticate posturing; and diffuse cerebral
edema on head imaging, would also be considered to have
grade 4 ICANS (Table 6).
The new grading is similar to the CARTOX CRES grading
guideline in regard to the CARTOX-10 screening assessment, in
that it classifies any patient too obtunded to perform the
assessment as having grade 4 ICANS. In contrast to CARTOX
CRES, the updated grading classifies an isolated generalized
seizure with return to baseline as grade 3 and reserves grade 4

 classification for prolonged >5 minutes or repetitive clinical or
subclinical (electroencephalography only) seizures without
return to baseline in between. This is consistent with life-
threatening seizures as defined by CTCAE v5.0.
Grade 4 patients typically need to be intubated for airway
control and seizure management. A patient may be intubated
for grade 4 ICANS, but this should not be recaptured as grade 4
CRS when other signs of severe CRS have resolved.
Grade 5 ICANS
By convention, grade 5 ICANS is defined as death due to
ICANS where another cause is not the principle factor leading
to this outcome.
CONSENSUS ON ICANS GRADING FOR CHILDREN
Although the 10-point ICE assessment is useful for screening
adults for encephalopathy, its use in children may be limited to
those age �12 years with sufficient cognitive ability to perform
the ICE assessment. For children age <12 years, the Cornell
Assessment of Pediatric Delirium (CAPD) [36,37] (Table 7) is rec-
ommended to aid in the overall grading of ICANS, as recently pro-
posed by Mahadeo et al [38]. A CAPD score of �9 is suggestive of
delirium and should be considered grade 3 ICANS. The CAPD
score also may be used in patients age >12 years with baseline
developmental delay as it has been validated up to age 21 years.
Other domains evaluated to grade ICANS in children are similar
to those used in adults and include level of consciousness, motor
symptoms, seizures, and signs of raised ICP (Table 8).
DATA COLLECTION AND REPORTING FOR APPROVED CELL
THERAPY PRODUCTS
The high unmet medical needs and large effect sizes seen in
clinical testing of CD19 CAR T cell therapies allowed approval
of the 2 current products based on data collected from <300
total patients on 3 single-arm Phase II trials. As a result, there
is broad agreement that further data collection on toxicity and
patient outcomes is paramount. The US Food and Drug Admin-
istration (FDA) requires that pharmaceutical companies that
produce commercial CAR T cell products establish a mecha-
nism to follow recipients of these therapies for 15 years,
although this requirement is focused mainly on monitoring for
potential long-term genotoxicity. Other health authorities may
impose other or more detailed requirements.
This raises important questions on how best to collect appro-
priate data, especially because these mandates are placed on the
companies but carried out by the centers in a largely volunteer
effort. Compliance with what could be a significant and unfunded
mandate will be enhanced by making sure that data collection is
appropriately focused, especially because these data will not be
collected in a research setting with research budgets and direct
regulatory mandates on the centers. Health authorities will need
to harmonize their data requests. In this new field of medicine,
companies may have to face the possibility of a gap between
what the FDA or European Medicines Agency (EMA) wants them
to collect and what centers are actually able to provide. There
needs to be a simplified and unified approach to reporting with a
single portal for data entry. A registry approach is likely to be the
best method of providing as complete data as possible.
The CIBMTR operates a large outcomes database, which for
decades has been a valuable resource for the field of transplanta-
tion. Most centers with active immune effector cell programs
have many years of experience using this database. Recognizing
the emergence of the field of cellular immunotherapy, in 2016
the CIBMTR launched a database dedicated to cellular therapy
outcomes. This registry tracks long-term follow-up of patients
who have received cellular therapies, including CAR T cells and
other cellular therapies beyond hematopoietic cell transplanta-
tion. As part of this process, the CIBMTR Cellular Therapy Task
Force developed new reporting forms specific to cellular therapy
[39], which were subsequently piloted and refined.
Since the launch in 2016, centers voluntarily have reported
data derived from more than 200 recipients of CAR T cells, which
are most commonly used for treatment of non-Hodgkin lym-
phoma and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Using a single, stan-
dardized database to capture information about recipients of
immune effector cell therapies can streamline the process and can

ICANS grade is determined by the most severe event (ICE or CAPD score, level of consciousness, seizure, motor findings, raised ICP/cerebral edema) not attributable to
any other cause. Baseline CAPD score should be considered before attributing to ICANS.

 provide a resource for research. The CIBMTR's Cellular Therapy
Registry infrastructure is well suited to meet this requirement.
Regulators in other regions are considering more require-
ments to assess the safety and efficacy of immune effector cell
therapies. The EMA organized a workshop in February 2018 to
identify a minimal set of data elements for commercial CAR T
cells [40]. In addition to common safety endpoints, the EMA
report outlined the capture of grade 3 and 4 organ toxicities
[41]. Lee et al initially included grade 2 to 4 nonhematologic
organ toxicities in their CRS grading criteria [14]; however, organ
toxicities are excluded in the new CRS consensus grading scheme
proposed here. Requiring reporting of organ toxicities in the
postmarket setting would add a considerable burden for data
collection, and it runs the risk of being infeasible. This example
highlights the need for harmonization in the data requested.
The CIBMTR Cellular Therapy Registry's follow-up form
captures toxicities after immune effector cell infusion, at 3
months, 6 months, 1 year, and yearly thereafter. The outcomes
routinely captured in the CIBMTR follow-up forms relevant to
CAR T cell toxicities include CRS, neurotoxicities, neutrophil
and platelet recovery, hypogammaglobulinemia, severe infec-
tions, nonhematologic grade 4 toxicities, and death from any
cause. For CRS, the registry computes a grade by capturing key
information related to CRS, including treatment (eg, use of vas-
opressors). This approach can accommodate changes in the
grading criteria, as proposed in this consensus statement, or
comparisons across grading systems. For ICANS, the forms cap-
ture the presence of different manifestations, and whether
they resolved. Issues raised on the applicability of CTCAE to
assess severity in hospitalized patients apply here as well.
Beyond the abovementioned toxicities, centers can report sub-
sequent neoplasms and pregnancies at any time through
event-driven forms. These forms aid the collection of time-sen-
sitive information or biospecimens, if needed.
We believe that it would be safest and most efficient to use
CIBMTR database reporting to meet the mandates placed on the
drug companies at a level that is feasible for centers offering
immune effector cell therapies outside the research setting. Bar-
ring unusual or notable toxicity that any treating physician can
choose to report to the FDA on a MedWatch form (as with any
other approved therapy), we endorse a system in which the
CIBMTR registry is a single resource that centers can use for stud-
ies of current and future approved cell therapies. The CIBMTR
built the Cellular Therapy Registry to serve the community and
to help advance the field by making the data available to investi-
gators. Standardized collection of toxicity data in the real-world
setting will help identify ways to make these therapies safer.
CONCLUSION
In conclusion, we have proposed consensus definitions and
grading for CRS and ICANS, the 2 most common toxicities asso-
ciated with immune effector cell therapies. We acknowledge
that as new data become available from existing and novel
immune effector cell therapies, this grading system may need to
be revised in the future. Nonetheless, we believe that our pro-
posed grading system is objective, easy to use, and more accu-
rately categorizes the severity of these toxicities. We strongly
recommend the use of this consensus grading system for report-
ing of CRS and neurotoxicity associated with immune effector
cell-engaging therapies across all clinical trials, as well as in the
postapproval standard of care setting. This would allow compar-
ison of the safety of different immune effector cell-engaging
therapies and also likely facilitate the development of optimal
strategies for prevention and/or management of these toxicities.
