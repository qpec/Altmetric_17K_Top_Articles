Abstract
Objective—Greater blood pressure reactivity to psychological stress has been associated with 
higher risk of developing hypertension. We hypothesised that low stress resilience based on 
psychological assessment early in life is associated with hypertension in adulthood.
Methods—National cohort study of 1 547 182 military conscripts in Sweden during 1969–1997 
(97–98% of all 18-year-old males) without prior history of hypertension, who underwent 
standardised psychological assessment by trained psychologists for stress resilience (1–9 scale), 
and were followed up for hypertension identified from outpatient and inpatient diagnoses during 
1969–2012 (maximum age 62).
Results—93 028 men were diagnosed with hypertension in 39.4 million person-years of follow-
up. Adjusting for body mass index (BMI), family history and socioeconomic factors, low stress 
resilience at age 18 was associated with increased risk of hypertension in adulthood (lowest vs 
highest quintile: HR 1.43; 95% CI 1.40 to 1.46; p<0.001; incidence rates, 278.7 vs 180.0 per 100 
000 person-years), including a strong linear trend across the full range of stress resilience 
(ptrend<0.0001). We also found a positive additive interaction between stress resilience and BMI 
(p<0.001), indicating that low stress resilience accounted for more hypertension cases among 
those with high BMI. Men with a combination of low stress resilience and high BMI had a more 
than threefold risk of hypertension.

 Conclusions—These findings suggest that low stress resilience may contribute to etiological 
pathways for hypertension and accounts for more cases among those with high BMI. If confirmed, 
this knowledge may help inform better preventive interventions by addressing psychosocial risk 
factors and stress management across the lifespan.
INTRODUCTION
Hypertension currently affects one in three adults and contributes to one in seven deaths in 
the USA.1 Globally, hypertension is increasing in prevalence and may affect >1.5 billion 
people by 2025, related in part to increasing rates of obesity, unhealthy diet and sedentary 
lifestyle.2 Substantial evidence has shown that psychosocial factors also contribute to the 
development of hypertension. For example, adverse childhood family environment,3 ‘type 
A’ behaviour patterns such as time urgency/impatience and hostile attitudes,4 chronic 
financial stress,5 anxiety6 and depression7 have been associated with a higher risk of 
hypertension. Studies also have reported that greater blood pressure reactivity to 
psychological stress is associated with subsequent development of hypertension.8,9 
However, to our knowledge, no studies have examined psychological assessment of stress 
resilience early in life in relation to hypertension risk in adulthood. Such knowledge may 
improve our understanding of psychosocial pathways and help inform more effective 
interventions to prevent hypertension across the lifespan.
We conducted a national cohort study to examine stress resilience in late adolescence in 
relation to hypertension risk in adulthood. Stress resilience was assessed by standardised 
psychological assessments of ~1.5 million 18-year-old male military conscripts in Sweden 
during 1969–1997, who were subsequently followed up to a maximum age of 62 years. Our 
aim was to determine whether low stress resilience in late adolescence is associated with 
subsequent development of hypertension in a large national cohort.
METHODS
Study population
We identified 1 547 478 males (age 18 years) who underwent a military conscription 
examination during 1969–1997. This examination was compulsory for all 18-year-old males 
nationwide each year except for 2–3% who either were incarcerated or had severe chronic 
medical conditions or disabilities documented by a physician. We excluded 296 (0.02%) 
individuals who had a prior diagnosis of hypertension identified from hospital discharge 
diagnoses. A total of 1 547 182 (>99.9% of the original cohort) remained for inclusion in the 
study. To ensure confidentiality, all names and national identification numbers were 
replaced by anonymous serial numbers in adherence to the Personal Data Act (1998:204) 
and the Act (1995:606) and Ordinance (1995:1060) on Certain Personal Registers.
Stress resilience ascertainment
Stress resilience assessments were obtained from the Swedish Military Conscription 
Registry, which contains information from a 2-day standardised physical and psychological 
examination administered annually to all Swedish military conscripts starting in 1969. Stress 
resilience was assessed using a 20–30 min semi-structured interview administered by trained

 psychologists.10 The overall objective of the interview was to assess the conscript’s ability 
to cope with the psychological requirements of military service, including stress resilience 
during armed combat. In the interview, the psychologist asked about adjustment problems 
and conflicts, as well as successes, responsibilities taken on and initiatives shown or 
experienced in school, work, home or in leisure activities.10 Emotional stability, social 
maturity and active/passive interests were rated by the psychologist, who then assigned a 
summary score on a ‘standardised nine’ (1–9) scale, which is constructed to have a normal 
distribution with a mean of 5 and an SD of 2. Consequently, this score had a consistent 
distribution throughout the study period. A validation study in which 30 recorded interviews 
from 1972 to 1973 were scored by 30 psychologists reported high inter-rater reliability 
(correlation 0.86).11 These data have previously been used to examine stress resilience in 
relation to other outcomes, including coronary heart disease.12
Hypertension ascertainment
The study cohort was followed up from the time of the military conscription examination 
through 31 December 2012 for essential (primary) hypertension, which was identified using 
International Classification of Diseases (ICD) diagnosis codes (400–401 in ICD-8, 401 in 
ICD-9 and I10 in ICD-10) in the Swedish Hospital Registry and Swedish Outpatient 
Registry. The Swedish Hospital Registry contains all primary and secondary hospital 
discharge diagnoses from six populous counties in southern Sweden starting in 1964, and 
with nationwide coverage starting in 1987; and the Swedish Outpatient Registry contains 
outpatient diagnoses from all specialty clinics nationwide starting in 2001. Throughout the 
study period, the predominant criteria for diagnosis of hypertension were a systolic blood 
pressure (SBP) ≥140 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥90 mm Hg, based on 
WHO and European Society of Hypertension/European Society of Cardiology 
guidelines.13,14
Adjustment variables
Other variables that may be associated with hypertension were obtained from the Swedish 
Military Conscription Registry and national census data, which were linked using an 
anonymous personal identification number. The association between stress resilience and 
hypertension was adjusted for the following variables: year of the military conscription 
examination (modelled simultaneously as a continuous and categorical (1969–1979, 1980–
1989, 1990–1997) variable to account for a potential non-linear effect); body mass index 
(BMI=[weight in kg]/[height in m]2; modelled simultaneously as a continuous and 
categorical variable to account for a potential non-linear effect, using Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention (CDC) definitions for children and adolescents aged 2–19 years to 
facilitate comparability with US studies: ‘overweight or obese’ is defined as ≥85th 
percentile on the CDC’s 2000 sex-specific BMI-for-age growth charts, which corresponds to 
BMI ≥25.6 for 18-year-old males15); type 2 diabetes (identified using ICD-9 code 250 
(excluding 250.X1 and 250.X3) during 1987–1996, and ICD-10 code E11 during 1997–
2012, and modelled as a time-dependent variable); family history of hypertension in a parent 
or sibling (identified from medical diagnoses in the Swedish Hospital Registry during 1964–
2012 and the Swedish Outpatient Registry during 2001–2012, using the same hypertension 
ICD codes as above plus ICD-7 codes 444–445 from 1964 to 1968; examined in any parent

 or sibling, and further stratified as hypertension in only one parent, both parents or any 
sibling); highest education level attained during the study period (<12, 12–14 and ≥15 
years); and neighbourhood socioeconomic status at baseline (SES, included because 
neighbourhood SES characteristics have been associated with psychosocial stress16 and 
hypertension;17 comprised of an index that includes low education level, low income, 
unemployment and social welfare receipt, as previously described;18 and categorised as low 
(>1 SD below the mean), medium (within 1 SD from the mean) or high (>1 SD above the 
mean)).
Missing data for each variable were imputed using a standard multiple imputation procedure 
that included all covariates, the outcome (hypertension) and the Nelson–Aalen estimate of 
the cumulative hazard in the imputation model.19 Missing data were relatively infrequent for 
stress resilience (7.2%), BMI (7.2%), education level (0.4%) and neighbourhood SES 
(9.1%). Data were complete for all other variables. As an alternative to multiple imputation, 
sensitivity analyses were performed after restricting to individuals with complete data for all 
variables (N=1 327 760; 86.5%).
Statistical analysis
Cox proportional hazards regression was used to compute HRs and 95% CIs for the 
association between stress resilience and subsequent risk of hypertension. The Cox model 
time scale was elapsed time since the military conscription examination (which also 
corresponds to attained age because baseline age was the same (18 years) for all conscripts). 
Individuals were censored at emigration (n=85 131; 5.5%) or death (n=58 171; 3.8%). Stress 
resilience was modelled alternatively as a categorical variable (1–9) or an ordinal variable to 
test for trend. In the first set of models, stress resilience and each covariate was modelled 
separately in relation to hypertension, adjusted for year of the military conscription 
examination. A second (fully adjusted) model included stress resilience, year of the military 
conscription examination, BMI, type 2 diabetes, family history of hypertension, education 
level and neighbourhood SES (as defined above). The proportional hazards assumption was 
assessed by graphical examination of log–log plots and was met in all models.
Interactions between stress resilience and BMI were examined on either the additive or 
multiplicative scale in relation to hypertension risk. Additive interactions were assessed 
using the ‘relative excess risk due to interaction’ (RERI), which is computed for binary 
variables as: RERIHR=HR11 – HR10 – HR01+1.20 Multiplicative interactions were assessed 
using the ratio of HRs: HR11/(HR10×HR01). All statistical tests were two–sided and used an 
α–level of 0.05. All analyses were conducted using Stata V.14.1.
RESULTS
Among the 1 547 182 men in this cohort, 93 028 (6.0%) were subsequently diagnosed with 
hypertension in 39.4 million person–years of follow–up (mean follow–up 25.7 years). The 
median age at the end of follow–up was 47.2 years (mean 47.4, SD 7.9, range 19.0–62.0). 
The median age at diagnosis of hypertension was 49.8 years (mean 48.5, SD 7.2, range 
18.0–62.0).

 Stress resilience
Low stress resilience was associated with subsequent increased risk of hypertension (table 
1). In the fully adjusted model, men in the lowest quintile of stress resilience had more than 
a 40% increased risk of developing hypertension relative to those in the highest quintile (HR 
1.43; 95% CI 1.40 to 1.46; p<0.001; incidence rates, 278.7 vs 180.0 per 100 000 person–
years). There was a highly significant linear trend in hypertension risk across the full range 
of stress resilience (ptrend<0.0001). The small difference in risk estimates between adjusted 
models 1 and 2 was explained almost entirely by adjusting for education, whereas other 
adjustment variables made little difference (table 1). Figure 1 shows the fully adjusted HRs 
and 95% CIs for hypertension across the full range of stress resilience, modelled as a 
continuous variable using cubic spline curves. A relatively steep slope of increasing risk of 
hypertension is seen for men with below–average stress resilience relative to average. Figure 
2 shows the absolute incidence rates for hypertension (per 100 000 person–years) by stress 
resilience level (continuous variable using cubic spline curves).
Other risk factors
High BMI and type 2 diabetes were independent risk factors for subsequent development of 
hypertension. In the fully adjusted model, overweight/obesity (≥85th percentile on the 
CDC’s 2000 sex–specific BMI–for–age growth chart) and type 2 diabetes were each 
associated with more than a 2.5–fold risk of hypertension. A first–degree family history of 
hypertension was associated with more than a 1.5–fold risk of developing hypertension, with 
a positive gradient by whether there was a history of hypertension in only one parent, both 
parents or a sibling (table 1). High education level and high neighbourhood SES were 
associated with lower risk of hypertension (ptrend<0.0001). In a sensitivity analysis that was 
restricted to men with no missing data, all risk estimates were very similar to the main 
results (data not shown).
Interaction between stress resilience and BMI
The joint effects of stress resilience and BMI in relation to hypertension risk are shown in 
table 2. Low stress resilience was associated with increased risk of hypertension among men 
with either normal or high BMI (HRs 1.38 and 1.31, respectively; table 2, right–most 
column). Men with a combination of low stress resilience and high BMI had the highest risk 
of hypertension, which was more than threefold relative to the reference group who had high 
stress resilience and normal BMI (HR 3.46; 95% CI 3.33 to 3.59). The interaction between 
low stress resilience and high BMI was non–significant on the multiplicative scale, but was 
highly significant on the additive scale (p<0.001), indicating that low stress resilience was 
associated with more hypertension cases among men with high BMI. If this association is 
causal, interventions to improve stress resilience would have the largest public health impact 
on preventing hypertension among those with high BMI.
DISCUSSION
In this large national cohort study, we found that low stress resilience in 18–year–old males 
was associated with increased risk of developing hypertension in adulthood, independently 
of BMI at baseline, diabetes, family history of hypertension and socioeconomic factors.

 These findings suggest that low stress resilience may play an important long–term role in 
etiological pathways for hypertension. If confirmed, this knowledge may help inform 
preventive interventions by better addressing psychosocial risk factors and stress 
management.
Previous smaller studies have suggested that blood pressure reactivity to various 
psychological stressors is associated with subsequent higher risk of hypertension.8,9 A 
meta–analysis of six cohort studies with a total of 34 556 adults and median follow–up of 
11.5 years found that those with greater blood pressure reactivity to psychological stressor 
tasks had a 21% higher odds of developing hypertension or a significant increase in baseline 
blood pressure compared with those with low reactivity (OR 1.21; 95% CI 1.14 to 1.28; 
p<0.001).21 Studies that have examined chronic stress exposures rather than cardiovascular 
reactivity to stress also have supported a psychosocial component in the development of 
hypertension. For example, a US cohort study of 2739 young adults reported that adverse 
childhood family environment was associated with negative emotions that predicted 
subsequent increases in SBP.3 In an overlapping cohort of 3308 young adults, ‘type A’ 
behaviours including time urgency/impatience and hostile attitudes were strongly associated 
with increased hypertension risk in a dose–response manner.4 A UK study of 160 middle–
aged adults with 3 years of follow–up reported that chronic financial stress was associated 
with subsequent higher baseline SBP.5 A Swedish study of 237 980 military conscripts (a 
subset of the present study cohort) found that low stress resilience was associated with a 
modestly increased risk of coronary heart disease, but did not examine hypertension or other 
risk factors for heart disease.12
High BMI and type 2 diabetes were the strongest risk factors for hypertension in the present 
study. The ~2.5–fold risk of hypertension that we observed among overweight or obese 
males is consistent with previously reported estimates for adult men or women.22 The ~1.5–
fold risk we observed among those with a family history of hypertension and an inverse 
relationship between education level and hypertension risk also were in agreement with 
previous findings.23 In addition, we found that low neighbourhood SES was associated with 
higher risk of hypertension, consistent with previously reported associations between 
neighbourhood deprivation characteristics such as poor walkability, availability of healthy 
foods, safety or social cohesion and hypertension risk.17
The mechanisms by which low stress resilience may contribute to the development of 
hypertension are complex and likely involve both physiological and behavioural factors. 
According to the ‘reactivity hypothesis’, exaggerated blood pressure responses to 
psychological stress may cause arterial damage and dysfunction over time, leading to the 
development of hypertension and cardiovascular disease.24 Previous studies have found that 
blood pressure reactivity to psychological stress in children, adolescents or adults predicts 
future baseline blood pressure and cardiovascular disease risk.8,9,25 Exaggerated blood 
pressure responses to psychological stress may originate at the cognitive–emotional level in 
how events are consciously evaluated, the hypothalamic or brainstem level causing greater 
physiological response even with normal psychological input or the peripheral level through 
altered tissue function.24 Abnormal responses at any of these levels may cause exaggerated 
blood pressure increases and resultant shear stress, eventually altering arterial structure and

 function. High SBP reactivity to psychological stress tasks, for example, has been associated 
with increased carotid artery intima–media thickness in youth.26 In addition to these 
pathways, low stress resilience may contribute to unhealthy lifestyle behaviours that are 
known risk factors for hypertension. A Danish cohort study of 7066 adults with 10 years of 
follow–up found that self–reported perceived stress was associated with subsequent physical 
inactivity, unsuccessful smoking cessation or alcohol reduction, and use of antihypertensive 
medications.27 Stress–related disorders such as anxiety6 and depression7 also are associated 
with physical inactivity, unhealthy diet and smoking, which are established risk factors for 
hypertension.28
The present study provides further evidence that interventions to prevent hypertension 
should address psychosocial and stress–related factors. Moreover, we found that such 
interventions are likely to have the largest public health impact among persons with high 
BMI. Most stress reduction programmes have focused on treatment rather than prevention of 
hypertension, with mixed results. A systematic review of seven meta–analyses found that 
stress reduction programmes yield reliable decreases in SBP of 6–10 mm Hg and slightly 
larger reductions for multicomponent interventions.29 The most effective psychological 
treatments were reported to yield the same reductions in SBP (but not DBP) as commonly 
used antihypertensive medications.29 However, a later meta–analysis of 17 trials with 960 
participants reported that meditation interventions but not stress management programmes 
resulted in significant blood pressure reductions.30 Additional studies of stress reduction for 
the prevention of hypertension are warranted, particularly in high–risk groups such as 
persons with high BMI.
Strengths of the present study include its large national cohort design with prospective 
assessment of stress resilience in late adolescence and sufficient follow–up to examine 
hypertension in adulthood. Prospective ascertainment of the exposure and outcome 
prevented bias that may result from self–reporting. Stress resilience was assessed using 
systematic interviews by trained psychologists with high inter–rater reliability. We were 
able to adjust for other established risk factors for hypertension, including BMI, diabetes, 
family history of hypertension, and individual and neighbourhood socioeconomic factors, 
which also were prospectively ascertained and not self–reported.
Limitations included a lack of information for certain other risk factors for hypertension, 
such as smoking and diet. This cohort consisted of Swedish military conscripts, and 
therefore included only men. However, a smaller Danish cohort study reported that 
perceived stress was associated with subsequent antihypertensive medication use among 
men and women, without gender differences.27 Outpatient diagnoses in the present study 
were available starting in 2001, and hence hypertension prior to this period was under–
reported. This under–reporting is expected to be non–differential with respect to stress 
resilience level, and therefore to influence results conservatively (ie, towards the null 
hypothesis).
In summary, this large national cohort study examined stress resilience in 18–year–old 
males in relation to hypertension risk in adulthood. We found that low stress resilience was 
associated with higher risk of developing hypertension and accounted for more cases among

 those with high BMI. These findings suggest that stress resilience may play an important 
long–term role in etiological pathways for hypertension. If confirmed, this knowledge may 
help inform more effective preventive interventions by better addressing psychosocial risk 
factors and stress management across the lifespan.

 Key messages
What is already known on this subject?
Greater blood pressure reactivity to psychological stress has been associated with higher 
risk of developing hypertension. However, no studies have examined psychological 
assessment of stress resilience early in life in relation to hypertension risk in adulthood.
What might this study add?
In a large national cohort, we found that low stress resilience in late adolescence was 
associated with higher risk of developing hypertension in adulthood, independently of 
body mass index, family history of hypertension and socioeconomic factors.
How might this impact on clinical practice?
These findings suggest that low stress resilience may play an important long-term role in 
etiological pathways for hypertension. If confirmed, this knowledge may help inform 
more effective preventive interventions by addressing psychosocial risk factors and stress 
management across the lifespan.

*Each variable was modelled separately in relation to hypertension, adjusted for year of military conscription examination.
†The model included year of military conscription examination, stress resilience, BMI, type 2 diabetes, family history of hypertension, education and neighbourhood SES. All reported risk estimates were 
obtained by modelling the respective variable alternatively as a categorical variable (with reference category indicated by HR of 1.00) or continuous variable (for trend tests).
‡BMI was categorised using CDC definitions for children and adolescents aged 2–19 years: ‘overweight or obesity’ is defined as ≥85th percentile on the CDC’s 2000 sex-specific BMI-for-age growth 
charts, which corresponds to BMI ≥25.6 for 18-year-old males.
BMI, body mass index; CDC, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; SES, socioeconomic status.
