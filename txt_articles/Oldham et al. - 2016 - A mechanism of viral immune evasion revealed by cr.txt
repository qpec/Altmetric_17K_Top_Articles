Abstract
Cellular immunity against viral infection and tumor cells depends on antigen presentation by the 
major histocompatibility complex class 1 molecules (MHC I). Intracellular antigenic peptides are 
transported into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by the transporter associated with antigen 
processing (TAP) and then loaded onto the nascent MHC I, which are exported to the cell surface 
and present peptides to the immune system1. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes recognize non-self peptides 
and program the infected or malignant cells for apoptosis. Defects in TAP account for 
immunodeficiency and tumor development. To escape immune surveillance, some viruses have 
evolved strategies to either down-regulate TAP expression or directly inhibit TAP activity. To date 
neither the architecture of TAP nor the mechanism of viral inhibition has been elucidated at the 
structural level. In this study we describe the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of 
human TAP in complex with its inhibitor ICP47, a small protein produced by the herpes simplex 
virus I. We show that the twelve transmembrane helices and two cytosolic nucleotide-binding 
domains (NBDs) of the transporter adopt an inward-facing conformation with the two NBDs 
separated. The viral inhibitor ICP47 forms a long helical hairpin, which plugs the translocation 
pathway of TAP from the cytoplasmic side. Association of ICP47 precludes substrate binding and 
also prevents NBD closure necessary for ATP hydrolysis. This work illustrates a striking example 
of immune evasion by persistent viruses. By blocking viral antigens from entering the ER, herpes 
simplex virus is hidden from cytotoxic T lymphocytes, which may contribute to establishing a 
lifelong infection in the host.

 Inside our body, every nucleated cell has surface “barcodes” that are surveyed by the 
immune system. These barcodes are peptides derived from intracellular proteins, presented 
on the surface by MHC I molecules to indicate whether the cell is healthy (reviewed in ref. 
1). Peptides generated from normal cellular proteins are ignored by cytotoxic T cells, 
whereas viral-derived or malignant peptides will trigger an adaptive immune response, 
resulting in elimination of the infected or tumor cells. The peptide repertoire is generated in 
the cytoplasm, mainly by the proteasome, but also in part by cytosolic peptidases (Fig 1a). 
Peptide uploading onto MHC I molecules takes place inside the ER and is orchestrated by a 
macromolecular assembly collectively called the MHC class I peptide-loading complex 
(PLC). Cytosolic peptides are delivered across the ER membrane by the ATP-binding 
cassette (ABC) transporter TAP. The chaperones calnexin and calreticulin stabilize nascent 
MHC I molecules awaiting peptides. The tapasin/ERp57 heterodimer brings MHC I 
molecules and TAP within close proximity and catalyzes peptide loading. Peptide-loaded 
MHC I molecules are then released from the ER and transported to the cell surface for 
antigen presentation.
As the MHC I antigen presentation pathway plays a crucial role in eradicating intracellular 
pathogens, it is not surprising that some viruses have evolved the ability to interfere with this 
process (reviewed in ref. 2). The peptide transporter TAP in particular is a primary target for 
viral evasion (reviewed in ref. 3). TAP is a heterodimeric ABC transporter that contains two 
subunits, TAP1 and TAP2, which share 37% sequence identity and are predicted to have 
similar structures. Each subunit contains an N-terminal transmembrane region (TMD0) that 
interacts with tapasin, followed by six transmembrane (TM) helices that form the peptide 
translocation pathway and a canonical nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) that hydrolyzes 
ATP (Fig 1b)4. The core TAP, devoid of the TMD0s, is necessary and sufficient for peptide 
transport4. So far, five viral proteins have been identified as TAP inhibitors. Four are 
encoded by members of the herpes virus family and one by cowpox virus3. These viral 
inhibitors are valuable tools for selective immune suppression and for understanding the 
fundamental mechanism of antigen presentation.
Here we focus our study on a TAP inhibitor encoded by herpes simplex virus (HSV). Both 
types of HSV, HSV-1 (oral herpes) and HSV-2 (genital herpes), somehow elude the human 
immune system and lead to a lifelong infection. The first clue as to how HSV bypasses the 
immune system came from observations that cells infected by HSV have reduced surface 
expression of MHC I molecules5 and are resistant to cytotoxic T cells6. Since this resistance 
develops within three hours of HSV infection, researchers narrowed their search for the 
responsible gene to those few expressed in the early stage of infection7,8. Out of these, an 
88-residue protein, ICP47, was found to bind to TAP and prevent peptide translocation into 
the ER7,8. Consequently, empty MHC I molecules were retained in the ER and viral peptide 
presentation was suppressed. Subsequent studies have shown that ICP47 interacts with TAP 
from the cytosolic side of the membrane and somehow prevents peptide binding9,10. The 
functional domain of ICP47 has been mapped to the N-terminal 35 residues11,12, which form 
an extended helix-loop-helix structure in lipid bilayers13.
In this study, we pursued structural determination of a TAP/ICP47 complex using cryo-
electron microscopy (cryo-EM). The small size of the complex (166 kDa total) and the

 predicted pseudo two-fold symmetry between TAP1 and TAP2 make it extremely 
challenging to accurately align particles for 3D reconstruction. To maximize the difference 
between the two TAP subunits, we used a shorter allele of TAP2 that lacks the last 17 amino 
acids in NBD2 (Fig 1b)14. Co-expression of TAP1 and TAP2 in Pichia pastoris (Extended 
Data Fig 1) produced a heterodimer that dissociates readily in detergents. However, by 
incubating the TAP-enriched membranes with ICP47 before detergent solubilization, the 
complex consisting of TAP1, TAP2, and ICP47 becomes more stable (Fig 1c and 1d). Cryo-
EM analysis of this complex (Extended Data Fig 2 and Fig 1d) produced a density map (Fig 
2) of an overall resolution of 6.5 Å, determined by the gold-standard refinement procedure 
(Extended Data Fig 3)15. In this reconstruction the TM helices and the connectivity between 
the helices are clearly resolved. The density corresponding to one NBD is significantly 
smaller than that for the other, allowing us to confidently differentiate TAP1 from TAP2 (Fig 
2b). Most importantly, we observe strong density corresponding to the functional region of 
ICP47, which reveals how this viral protein inhibits peptide translocation (Fig 2b).
The core region of TAP adopts an inverted “V”-shaped structure, with the two TMDs 
making close contact on the side corresponding to the ER lumen and the NBDs separated 
from each other inside the cytosol (Fig 2c). Domain swapping of TM helices 4 and 5 across 
the TAP1/TAP2 interface is a prominent structural feature (Fig 2c). Indeed, the overall 
structure of TAP is very similar to that of other ABC exporters, including the lipid flippase 
MsbA from Gram-negative bacteria16, the protein transporter PCAT1 from Gram-positive 
bacteria17, and the multidrug transporter P-glycoprotein in eukaryotes18,19. Although these 
transporters recognize very different substrates, they must share a common evolutionary 
origin and a common mechanism for coupling ATP hydrolysis to substrate translocation.
No density was observed for the N-terminal TMD0 domain of both TAP1 and TAP2 
subunits (Fig 2). Studies have shown that the TMD0s are essential to the assembly of the 
large peptide-loading complex4,20 but dispensable in peptide translocation4. ICP47 inhibits 
both full-length TAP and the core construct4. Our results indicate that in the absence of 
tapasin the two TMD0s are flexibly tethered to the core region of TAP.
Biochemical data and homology modeling suggest that the peptide translocation pathway 
lies at the interface of the two TMDs21,22. Inside this pathway, we observe strong density 
consistent with the helix-loop-helix structure of ICP47 (Fig 2b and 3a). Guided by the NMR 
structure and secondary structure prediction13, we built residues 3-16 into the shorter helical 
density and residues 22-40 into the longer density (Fig 3). Additional density is packed 
along the cytosolic region of TAP2, into which we modeled residues 41-50. The C-terminal 
region, neither required for TAP inhibition nor conserved between HSV-1 and HSV-2 (Fig 
3c), is not resolved in the EM map, suggesting high mobility.
On the basis of this model, the N-terminal half of ICP47 forms a hairpin-like structure 
pinned against the inner surface of TAP2 TM helices 2, 3, 6 and TAP1 TM helix 4 (Fig 3b). 
The two helices of ICP47 run anti-parallel to each other, connected by a sharp turn at the top 
of the TM cavity. The extensive packing between TAP and ICP47 is consistent with the 
nanomolar affinity of ICP47, orders of magnitude higher than those of the substrate 
peptides9,12.

 The potency of ICP47 appears to come from its helical hairpin structure, which provides a 
greater interface with TAP than a typical substrate. To test whether the flexibility of the 
connecting loop is important, we constructed a “turn-to-helix” mutant by replacing residues 
16-22 with alanine, which has the highest propensity to form an α-helix and thus would 
oppose (but not preclude) the formation of a turn. ICP47 activity was measured in human 
epithelial cells, in which cytosolic expression of ICP47 inhibits endogenous TAP and 
reduces the amount of MHC I molecules expressed on the cell surface. A GFP tag was fused 
to the C-terminus of ICP47 as a marker to select for cells expressing similar amounts of 
ICP47. Consistent with the EM structure and previous mutagenesis data11, the “turn-to-
helix” mutant is much less potent than the wt construct. Specifically, mutant ICP47 reduced 
surface MHC I expression by only 5-fold as opposed to a 20-fold reduction by wt ICP47 
(Fig 3d).
Although ICP47 competes for the same binding site, we do not believe it mimics the 
substrate binding process. Unlike substrates, ICP47 inhibits rather than stimulates ATP 
hydrolysis23. Furthermore, in contrast to ICP47, which separates the two NBDs, substrate 
binding induces partial closure of the NBDs24. More recently, electron paramagnetic 
resonance (EPR) studies showed that TAP binds its substrates in their extended 
conformation, comparable to how MHC I molecules present peptides25.
Comparison of our structure with the NMR structure13 suggests that ICP47 undergoes major 
conformational changes upon association with TAP (Fig 4). In isolation, the N-terminal two 
helices of ICP47 are flexibly linked and bind to the surface of the membrane at a slight tilt13. 
In the complex with TAP, ICP47 forms a straight hairpin and inserts perpendicularly into the 
membrane. Although exact determinations of the amino acid register cannot be made at the 
current resolution, the overall structure readily explains how ICP47 inhibits peptide transport 
into the ER. By plugging a long helical hairpin into the translocation pathway, ICP47 
directly blocks substrates from binding. Furthermore, because ICP47 is too large to be 
transported by TAP, its high-affinity binding traps TAP in an inactive conformation. Like 
other ABC transporters, TAP functions by alternating between two major conformations, 
each exposing the translocation pathway to one side of the membrane (Fig 4). Binding of 
ICP47 stabilizes the inward-facing conformation, and thus prevents TAP from transitioning 
to an outward-facing state in which the NBDs form a closed dimer and the translocation 
pathway orientates towards the ER lumen (Fig 4).
In addition to viral inhibition discussed in this study, the structural basis of two cellular 
regulatory mechanisms has been elucidated26-28; both are relevant to nutrient uptake in 
bacteria. As a classic example of carbon catabolite repression, when a preferred carbon 
source is available, bacteria suppress the uptake of maltose through direct binding of a 
regulatory protein to the maltose transporter26. Methionine and molybdate transporters offer 
another example27,28. In both cases, at high intracellular concentration, the substrate binds 
and inhibits the corresponding transporter, a feedback mechanism that limits the amount of 
import into the cell27,28. Unlike viral inhibition, both cellular inhibitions are allosteric and 
reversible, regulated by the metabolic state of the cells. One common theme among all these 
inhibition mechanisms is that the inhibitor binds and stabilizes the transporter in the inward-
facing state, a conformation unable to hydrolyze ATP. We speculate that this strategy may be

 advantageous in preserving cellular energy sources. It is also possible that for most ABC 
transporters, the inward-facing state is most common and thus naturally targeted by 
regulators.
Methods
Expression and purification of ICP47
The gene encoding human herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) ICP47 was synthesized 
(BioBasic) and subcloned into the ligation-independent cloning vector pMCSG20 (AmpR), 
which contains an N-terminal glutathione S-transferase (GST) affinity tag preceding a 
tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease cleavage site. BL21(DE3)RIL E. coli cells containing the 
pMCSG20-ICP47 vector were grown to mid-exponential phase at 37°C in LB medium and 
expression was induced with 200 μM isopropyl β-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG) at 20°C for 24 h. 
The cells were harvested via centrifugation (4,000 xg for 12 min at 4°C) and broken by two 
passes through a high-pressure homogenizer (EmulsiFlex-C3; Avestin). Cell lysate 
supernatants were loaded onto glutathione sepharose 4B resin (GE Healthcare) equilibrated 
with PBS buffer, pH 7.4, containing 5 mM D,L-dithiothreitol (DTT). To remove the GST tag 
from ICP47, the column was equilibrated into a TEV protease cleavage buffer containing 50 
mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, and 5 mM DTT and incubated with 
TEV protease overnight. Untagged ICP47 was eluted and further purified by Superdex 75 
gel-filtration chromatography (GE Healthcare) in TEV-cleavage buffer. Fractions containing 
the protein were pooled, concentrated to 3 mg/ml, and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen.
Co-expression of TAP1/TAP2
Synthetic human TAP1 and TAP2 genes were codon-optimized for expression in Pichia 
pastoris (BioBasic) and subcloned into pPICZ-C-XE-Protein A (ZeoR) and pPICZ-C-XE 
vectors (ZeoR), respectively. In order to ensure co-expression at a 1:1 molar ratio, we took 
advantage of the compatible cohesive ends of BamHI and Bgl II restriction sites to generate 
an expression cassette as outlined in Extended Data Figure 1. The resultant vector was 
linearized by PmeI digestion and transformed into a HIS+ strain of SMD1163 by 
electroporation (BioRad Gene Pulser II). Transformants were selected on yeast extract 
peptone dextrose sorbitol (YPDS) agar containing 800 μg/ml zeocin. Colonies were grown 
in yeast extract peptone dextrose (YPD) cultures at 28°C until they reached an OD 600 of 4 
to seed flasks containing minimal glycerol medium (MGY), 13.4% yeast nitrogen base and 
1% glycerol at a starting OD 600 of 0.5. The MGY cultures were grown at 28°C for 24 h 
until they reached an OD 600 of 20, at which point they were harvested by centrifugation 
(1,500 xg for 15 min at 4°C) and used to seed flasks containing minimal methanol medium 
(MMY), 13.4% yeast nitrogen base and 0.5% methanol at a starting OD 600 of 10. These 
MMY cultures were grown at 28°C for 24 h before harvesting (1,500 xg for 15 min at 4°C). 
Cell pellets were fractionated and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen.
Purification of the TAP/ICP47 complex
Cells expressing TAP1-Protein A/TAP2 were lysed using a mixer mill (Retsch Mixer Mill 
400) and incubated with purified ICP47 in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 500 
mM NaCl, 15% glycerol, DNase I, protease inhibitors, and 2 mM TCEP for 30 min. Cells

 were then solubilized with 1.5% n-dodecyl-β-D-maltoside (DDM; Anatrace) for 2 h. The 
solubilized fraction was isolated by centrifugation (70,000 xg for 40 min at 4°C). The TAP1-
Protein A/TAP2/ICP47 complex was isolated using the Protein A affinity tag on TAP1 by 
lgG Sepharose 6 Fast Flow (GE Healthcare). After extensive washing, PreScission protease 
(GE Healthcare) was added to the column and incubated overnight to remove the Protein A 
tag. The complex was eluted with additional buffer and further purified using a Superose 6 
column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM 
TCEP, 1 mM DDM, and 1 mM octaethylene glycol monododecyl ether (C12E8; Anatrace). 
The peak fraction was used to prepare cryo-EM grids.
Initial cryo-electron microscopy imaging and generation of an initial model
Vitrified specimens of TAP/ICP47 complex were prepared on glow-discharged Quantifoil 
holey carbon grids by plunge-freezing into liquid ethane using a Vitrobot (FEI). Cryo-EM 
data were collected at liquid-nitrogen temperature using a K2 Summit direct electron 
detector camera (Gatan Inc.) on a Tecnai F20 electron microscope (FEI) operating at 200 
keV. Dose-fractionated image stacks were recorded with UCSF Image 429 in super-
resolution counting mode at a calibrated magnification of 40410x (nominal magnification of 
29,000x) with a dose rate of 8 electrons/pixel/s (5.2 electrons/Å2/s). Frames were read out 
every 200 ms and 30 frames were collected, resulting in an exposure time of 6 s and a total 
dose of 31.2 electrons/Å2. Dose-fractionated image stacks were 2x binned and motion-
corrected, as described29. The defocus was determined with CTER30. BOXER was used to 
interactively pick 28,813 particles from ~750 images31. The particle images were subjected 
to the iterative stable alignment and clustering (ISAC) procedure32 implemented in 
SPARX33. Four ISAC generations specifying 100 particles-per-group and a pixel error 
threshold of 0.7 yielded 324 averages. Of these, 270 averages were used to calculate an 
initial 3D density map with the validation of individual parameter reproducibility (VIPER) 
procedure in SPARX.
Electron microscopy sample preparation and imaging for the final 3D reconstruction
Cryo-EM grids were prepared by pipetting 3 μl freshly purified TAP/ICP47 (2 mg/ml) onto 
glow-discharged C-flat holey carbon CF-1.2/1.3-4C grids (Protochips) and letting the 
sample adsorb for 20 s. The grids were blotted for 4 s at 90% humidity using a Vitrobot 
Mark IV (FEI) and immediately plunge-frozen in liquid nitrogen-cooled liquid ethane. The 
grids were imaged using a FEI Titan Krios electron microscope operating at an acceleration 
voltage of 300 keV. Images were recorded using a K2 Summit direct electron detector 
(Gatan Inc.) set to super-resolution counting mode with a super-resolution pixel size of 
0.675 Å using the program SerialEM34. In addition, a Gatan Imaging filter with a slit width 
of 20 eV was used to remove inelastically scattered electrons. Movie frames were recorded 
with an exposure time of 200 ms using a dose rate of 10 electrons/pixel/s or 5.5 
electrons/Å2/s (1.35 Å at the image plane). Three datasets were recorded using different total 
doses and defocus ranges (Extended Data Table 1 and Extended Data Figure 2).
Image processing
Movie frames were corrected for gain reference and binned by a factor of 2, giving a pixel 
size of 1.35 Å. Drift correction was performed using the program Unblur35,36. Next, the

 drift-corrected frames were summed into single micrographs, which were used to estimate 
the Contrast Transfer Function (CTF) using CTFFIND437. The program Summovie was 
used to recalculate the summed images, first with a low-pass filter for autopicking and then 
with the noise power restored after filtering for particle extraction38. Autopicking, particle 
extraction, 2D classification, 3D classification, and initial 3D refining were all performed in 
Relion39. In order to achieve a more robust classification of the extracted particles, 2D 
classification was performed with a particle mask diameter of 145 Å while ignoring the 
effects of the CTF until the first zero transition. 3D classification was performed on particles 
from selected 2D classes using the initial model calculated in SPARX as a reference map. 
Particles from selected 3D classes from both datasets were combined for 3D refinement. 
Using the orientation parameters determined by Relion, 3D refinement in FREALIGN was 
also performed40. The final map, reconstructed from 139,293 particles, had a resolution of 
6.5 Å as determined by Fourier shell correlation (FSC) of independently refined half-
datasets using the 0.143 cut-off criterion (Extended Data Figure 3).
Model building
We used a model of the TAP1 nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) from a previously reported 
structure of the isolated domain (PDBcode 1JJ7)41 to generate a homology model for the 
TAP2 NBD using the program Modeller42. We also generated a homology model of the 
TAP1 and TAP2 transmembrane domains (TMDs) using the half-transporter subunit of 
human ABCB10 (PDBcode 4AYT) as the source structure 43. We manually docked these 
poly-alanine models into our final cryo-EM map and rebuilt each model in Coot44.
Flow Cytometry analysis of MHC class I surface expression
MHC I surface expression was analyzed using the phycoerythrin-coupled antibody W6/32 
(Abcam), which recognizes a monomorphic epitope shared among MHC class I molecules. 
Genes encoding HSV-1 wild-type ICP47 and the “turn-to-helix” (TtH) mutant were cloned 
into a modified version of the pCDNA 3.1 vector (Life Technologies) that adds a C-terminal 
EGFP tag. HeLa cells (ATCC® CCL-2™) were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 5 × 
105 cells/well and transfected with wt ICP47, the TtH mutant, or the empty vector. Cells 
were detached from the plate using trypsin-EDTA (0.05%) at 72 h post-transfection and 
washed in ice-cold FACS buffer (Ca++/Mg++ free phosphate buffer, 10% FCS, 1% sodium 
azide) and centrifuged at 400 ×g for 5 min at 4°C. Nonspecific binding was blocked by 
incubating the cells with phosphate buffer containing 5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin 
(BSA) for 15 min on ice. Antibody was added at 5 μg/ml and incubated for 30 min at 4°C in 
the dark. Subsequently, the cells were washed 3 times in FACS buffer, resuspended at a 
density of 3 × 106 cells/ml, and counted using a BD LSR II Flow Cytometer (BD 
Biosciences). The cells were analyzed at wavelengths 405 nm for DAPI nuclear stain, 488 
nm for GFP fluorescence, and 561 nm for phycoerythrin fluorescence. Only live, single cells 
with the same levels of GFP fluorescence were used in phycoerythrin gating to compare 
MHC class I expression. The flow cytometry data were analyzed using FlowJo 10.1 single 
cell analysis software (Tree Star). All experiments were repeated three times. The cell line 
was tested for mycoplasma contamination by PCR using the Universal Mycoplasma 
Detection Kit (ATCC® 30-1012K™)

 Figure 4. ICP47 precludes peptide binding and traps TAP in an inward-facing conformation
TAP functions via alternating access, cycling between two major conformations. In the 
absence of substrates, the transporter rests in an inward-facing state in which the two NBDs 
are separated and the translocation pathway is exposed to the cytosol. Upon association of 
substrates and ATP, the transporter undergoes a conformational change that reorients the 
TMDs and positions ATP at a closed NBD dimer interface for hydrolysis. ATP hydrolysis 
releases the substrate and resets the transporter to the resting state. ICP47 binds TAP 
stabilizes the inward-facing conformation.
