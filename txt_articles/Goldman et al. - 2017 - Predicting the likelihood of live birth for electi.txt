STUDY QUESTION: Can a counseling tool be developed for women desiring elective oocyte cryopreservation to predict the likelihood of
live birth based on age and number of oocytes frozen?
SUMMARY ANSWER: Using data from ICSI cycles of a population of women with uncompromised ovarian reserve, an evidence-based
counseling tool was created to guide women and their physicians regarding the number of oocytes needed to freeze for future family-
building goals.
WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Elective oocyte cryopreservation is increasing in popularity as more women delay family building. By
undertaking elective oocyte freezing at a younger age, women hope to optimize their likelihood of successful live birth(s) using their thawed
oocytes at a future date. Questions often arise in clinical practice regarding the number of cryopreserved oocytes sufficient to achieve live
birth(s) and whether or not additional stimulation cycles are likely to result in a meaningful increase in the likelihood of live birth. As relatively
few women who have electively cryopreserved oocytes have returned to use them, available data for counseling patients wishing to undergo
fertility preservation are limited.
STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: A model was developed to determine the proportion of mature oocytes that fertilize and then
form blastocysts as a function of age, using women with presumably normal ovarian reserve based on standard testing who underwent ICSI
cycles in our program from January, 2011 through March, 2015 (n = 520). These included couples diagnosed exclusively with male-factor
and/or tubal-factor infertility, as well as cycles utilizing egg donation. Age-specific probabilities of euploidy were estimated from 14 500 PGS
embryo results from an external testing laboratory. Assuming survival of thawed oocytes at 95% for women <36 y and for egg donors, and
85% for women ≥36 y, and 60% live birth rate per transferred euploid blastocyst, probabilities of having at least one, two or three live birth
(s) were calculated.
PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHOD: First fresh male-factor and/or tubal-factor only autologous ICSI cycles (n = 466)
were analyzed using Poisson regression to calculate the probability that a mature oocyte will become a blastocyst based on age. Egg donation
cycles (n = 54) were analyzed and incorporated into the model separately. The proportion of blastocysts expected to be euploid was deter-
mined using PGS results of embryos analyzed via array comparative genomic hybridization. A counseling tool was developed to predict the likeli-
hood of live birth, based on individual patient age and number of mature oocytes.
MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: This study provides an evidence-based model to predict the probability of a woman
having at least one, two or three live birth(s) based on her age at egg retrieval and the number of mature oocytes frozen. The model is derived
from a surrogate population of ICSI patients with uncompromised ovarian reserve. A user-friendly counseling tool was designed using the
model to help guide physicians and patients.

 LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The data used to develop the prediction model are, of necessity, retrospective and not
based on patients who have returned to use their cryopreserved oocytes. The assumptions used to create the model, albeit reasonable and
data-driven, vary by study and will likely vary by center. Centers are therefore encouraged to consider their own blastocyst formation and
thaw survival rates when counseling patients.
WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Our model will provide a counseling resource that may help inform women desiring
elective fertility preservation regarding their likelihood of live birth(s), how many cycles to undergo, and when additional cycles would bring
diminishing returns.
STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTERESTS: None.

Introduction
As more women choose to delay childbearing, elective oocyte preser-
vation is increasing in popularity (Rudick et al., 2010; Stoop et al.,
2011; Cil et al., 2013; Mesen et al., 2015). By electively freezing
oocytes, women hope to optimize their likelihood of successful live
birth(s) using their thawed oocytes at a future date. One question that
often arises in clinical practice is: How many cryopreserved oocytes
are sufficient to achieve a live birth?
To date, relatively few healthy women who have electively cryopre-
served oocytes to delay childbearing have returned to use their
oocytes (Cobo et al., 2013; Garcia-Velasco et al., 2013; Hodes-Wertz
et al., 2013; Schattman, 2015). It is therefore difficult to find an appro-
priate sample population from which to counsel presumably fertile
women about the optimal number of oocytes to electively cryopre-
serve. Some practices that offer elective oocyte preservation suggest
that patients freeze at least 10–20 oocytes based on age, though there
is little concrete data to support recommendations on the ideal num-
ber of oocytes to store (Stoop, 2010; Doyle et al., 2016). Assuming it
takes an average couple 6 months to conceive (Hilgers et al., 1992;
Gnoth et al., 2003), freezing at least six oocytes should theoretically
yield a high quality embryo capable of supporting a viable pregnancy.
Extrapolating this assumption further, 20 frozen oocytes should enable
up to three thaw cycles of six to seven oocytes each, with each having
the capability of resulting in a birth. However, even among similarly
aged young women, the number and quality of oocytes obtained per
cycle is heterogeneous (Munné et al., 2006, 2012). Furthermore, since
the increase in chromosomal abnormalities with maternal age is
strongly correlated with a decrease in embryo viability (Ata et al.,
2012; Harton et al., 2013; Franasiak et al., 2014a), it is reasonable to
assume that older women will require more frozen oocytes to achieve
a live birth compared to younger women. It is therefore challenging to
predict how many oocytes each woman should freeze to optimize her
probability of a having a future live birth.
Finally, although data examining the success rates from frozen versus
fresh oocyte IVF cycles have been mixed, most recent studies have
concluded that outcomes are comparable, particularly with the
increased use of vitrification when compared with slow-freezing tech-
niques (Almodin et al., 2010; Cobo et al., 2010; Grifo and Noyes,
2010; Rienzi et al., 2010; Kushnir et al., 2015; Rienzi et al., 2016).
Interestingly, a recent retrospective analysis of Society for Assisted
Reproductive Technology (SART) data challenges the notion that fro-
zen cycles are as good as fresh, finding that among patients using donor
oocytes, live birth was 19% more likely for those who used fresh as
compared to frozen oocytes (Kushnir et al., 2015).
The purpose of the present study was to develop a counseling tool
for women who wish to undergo elective oocyte cryopreservation,
which predicts the likelihood of achieving at least one, two, or three live
birth(s) based on patient age and the number of mature oocytes frozen.
In order to optimize accuracy of predictions for a presumed fertile
woman who is electively preserving her oocytes for prevention of age-
related infertility in the future, analyses were limited to couples diag-
nosed with only male factor and/or tubal factor (without hydosalpinx)
infertility and who underwent ICSI; additional analyses were performed
for cycles in which egg donation was used. Moreover, given the estab-
lished age-related increased incidence of oocyte aneuploidy (Franasiak
et al., 2014b), expected euploid blastocyst rates by age were also incor-
porated into the model (Ata et al., 2012 and unpublished data).
The overall goal of this study was to create a tool to guide women
and their physicians regarding the estimated number of oocytes
needed to freeze for their specified future family-building goals. This
model could also be used to inform women whether undergoing add-
itional oocyte cryopreservation cycles would result in a meaningful
increase in their likelihood of having a live birth.
Materials and Methods
IVF cycles and laboratory protocols
We conducted a retrospective analysis of 520 first fresh autologous cycles
using ICSI performed from 1/2011 to 3/2015 at the Center for Infertility
and Reproductive Surgery at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. Cycles were
included if male-factor (n = 423) and/or tubal factor (n = 43) infertility
were the only diagnoses, or if egg donation was used (n = 54). Notably,
cycles were excluded if (i) patients with tubal-factor infertility had a hydro-
salpinx; (ii) if diminished ovarian reserve was reported in the electronic
record based on standard testing; or (iii) if PGD/PGS was used. Approval
for this study was obtained from the Partners HealthCare Institutional
Review Board.
All gametes and embryos were cultured at 37°C in a humidified incuba-
tor under an atmosphere of CO2 (5–6%), O2 (5%) and N2 (89–90%). ICSI

 was used for all cycles studied and was performed 3–5 h after oocyte
retrieval, followed by a fertilization check 16–18 h later. A single step
medium (25 uL microdrops; Global Total, IVFOnLine, Guelph, Ontario,
Canada) was used to culture zygotes with two pronuclei. Embryos were
evaluated on Day 3 between 66 and 69 h post-insemination, and then
moved to a fresh drop of equilibrated Global Total medium for culture to
Day 5. Blastocyst morphology was then evaluated on Day 5 between 112
and 115 h and scored according to the stage of development, and the qual-
ity of the inner cell mass and trophectoderm.
Statistical methods
The 520 first fresh ICSI cycles were used to predict the blastulation potential
of each mature oocyte retrieved. Poisson regression was used to predict
the proportion of mature oocytes that ultimately developed into usable blas-
tocysts as a function of patient age using the male-factor and/or tubal-factor
only cycles; egg donation cycles were considered separately. For patients
who underwent embryo transfer on Day 5, this fraction was calculated as:

unknown whether transferred embryos would have blastulated in culture,
the fraction was calculated as:

This model assumes 95% survival of thawed mature oocytes for patients
<36 y and egg donors, and 85% survival for patients ≥36 y, based on previ-
ously published data (Practice Committees of American Society for
Reproductive Medicine and Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology,
2013; Cobo et al., 2016).
To determine the probability that any one blastocyst would be euploid,
aggregate data by individual year of age from Reprogenetics was utilized,
which included 14 500 PGS results obtained using array CGH (Ata et al.,
2012 and unpublished data). In order to reflect the presumably fertile popu-
lation of women desiring elective oocyte freezing, these PGS cycles from
Reprogenetics were restricted to those in which patients had only male-
factor infertility, or if cycles were run ‘by request’, which excludes patients
with reported female infertility. According to their data, the percentage of
euploid blastocysts was associated with female partner’s age, and was,
importantly, independent of embryo cohort size.
The projected fraction of euploid blastocysts, patient age and the number
of mature oocytes retrieved were used to predict the probability of having at
least one, two or three live birth(s). Our model assumed that the outcome
from each future embryo transfer was a statistically independent event, and
that approximately 60% of transferred euploid blastocysts would ultimately
result in a live birth (Forman et al., 2013, 2014; Schoolcraft and Katz-Jaffe,
2013; Scott et al., 2013; Fiorentino et al., 2014). All statistical analyses were
performed using Matlab (version R2015a, MathWorks, Natick MA).
Demographic data are presented as mean ± standard deviation.
Results
Patient demographic and cycle information are shown in Table I. The
diagnosis in the majority of cycles was male-factor only infertility
(81.3%; n = 423). A smaller proportion of cycles were performed for
tubal-factor infertility (8.3%; n = 43). There were 54 egg donation
cycles, and the average donor age was 28.5 y. On average, women
<38 y of age were more likely to have a day five embryo transfer than
older women; women ≥43 y exclusively underwent Day 3 ET. The
total number of mature oocytes retrieved from the 520 cycles used in
this analysis was 6415. As expected, the number of oocytes retrieved,
number of mature oocytes, and number of embryos obtained
decreased with increasing age. The average fertilization rate (No. 2PN
embryos/No. mature oocytes) for the population was 73%.
The first equation was developed using individual patient-level data
from male-factor and/or tubal-factor only cycles using Poisson regres-
sion. This equation (Equation 1 below) calculated the probability that
one mature oocyte will become a blastocyst [p(blast)] for any given
patient age (years, y). The 0.95 in the equation represents the
assumed 95% survival of thawed mature oocytes for patients <36 y,
and is replaced by 0.85 for patients ≥36 y, representing 85% survival.
As the age-dependent decrease in live birth begins appreciably after
the age of 35 y in our patient population (data not shown), all patients
≤35.0 y were categorized together into one group.

Predictive model for elective egg freezing
Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/humrep/article-abstract/32/4/853/2968357 by guest on 03 June 2019
 For example, patients aged 34, 37 and 42 y, each having eight
mature oocytes, would be predicted to have, on average, 3, 2, and
one blastocysts, respectively. The blastulation rate for egg donation
cycles was calculated separately. An egg donor who produced eight
mature oocytes would be expected to have three blastocysts.
A second model was developed to determine the probability that
any single blastocyst would be euploid [p(euploid)] using age-specific
Reprogenetics data (Ata et al., 2012 and unpublished data). The per-
centage of euploid blastocysts ranged from 57.4% for a woman ≤35 y
to 12.7% for a 44-year-old (Supplementary Table SI). As an example, in
a 37-year-old patient, the probability that a blastocyst is euploid is
0.486. In other words, 48.6% of her blastocysts are expected to be
euploid, independent of her total number of blastocysts. The percent-
age of euploid blastocysts decreased linearly with patient age from 35
to 44 y (P < 0.01, test of linear trend).
The probability of having a live birth with a given number of mature
oocytes can be approximated using Equation 2 below, which combines
the regression from Equation 1 [p(blast)] with the p(euploid)
Reprogenetics data, and assumes that, on average, a transferred
euploid blastocyst will result in a live birth 60% of the time (Forman
et al., 2013, 2014). The predictions from Equation 2 assume that the
probabilities of each mature oocyte resulting in a live birth are statistic-
ally independent.

Using the above equation, the probability of having at least one live
birth as a function of the number of mature oocytes is shown in
Figure 1 and Supplementary Table SII, stratified by year above age 35.
The probability of having at least two or three live births is shown in
Supplemental Tables SIII and SIV, respectively.
According to this final model, we find, for example, that women age
34, 37 or 42 y, each with 20 mature oocytes frozen, would be
expected to have a 90, 75 and 37% likelihood of having at least one
live birth, respectively. Correspondingly, women age 34, 37 or 42y
would have to freeze 10, 20 and 61 oocytes, respectively, to have a
75% likelihood of having at least one live birth. A patient similar to an
egg donor (average age 28.5 y in our population) would be expected
to have a 94% likelihood of having a live birth with 20 mature oocytes
frozen. Women age 34, 37 or 42 y, each with 20 mature oocytes fro-
zen, would be expected to have a 66, 39 and 7% likelihood of having at
least two live births, and a 38, 15 and 1% likelihood of having at least
three live births, respectively.
Discussion
As the number of women who elect to cryopreserve their oocytes
increases, so does the demand for counseling tools that can
adequately predict their probabilities of having a live birth. Frequently,
patients will ask about the ‘ideal’ number of oocytes to store for future
use. This is, of course, challenging to determine as it depends on a
number of factors, including maternal and paternal health, the goals of
Figure 1 Live birth predictions by age and number of mature oocytes retrieved. Each curve shows the percent likelihood that a patient of a given age will
have at least one live birth according to Equation 2, based on the number of mature oocytes retrieved and frozen.

 the individual patient, and because no number of frozen oocytes can
guarantee a live birth. While some patients may feel comfortable hav-
ing a 50% likelihood of live birth in the future from their frozen eggs,
others may not wish to proceed with oocyte cryopreservation unless
that probability is much greater; alternatively, they may wish to under-
take additional oocyte cryopreservation attempts to improve that
probability. Moreover, some women may hope to have multiple chil-
dren from their frozen eggs in the future.
This study provides a model to predict a patient’s probability of hav-
ing at least one, two, or three live birth(s) based on her age and the
number of mature oocytes retrieved. Although our use of fresh male-
factor and/or tubal-factor only ICSI cycles does not provide a perfect
representation of women electing to undergo oocyte fertility preserva-
tion, such cycles can serve as surrogates for presumably fertile women
of comparable age considering elective oocyte cryopreservation. With
current technologies, women who elect to cryopreserve their oocytes
will have to use ICSI after a future egg thaw. Egg donors, who are typic-
ally young, fertile and have good ovarian reserve, can also serve as a
proxy population and were incorporated into this model. PGS data for
prediction of euploidy was additionally restricted to cycles without a
diagnosis of female infertility.
Several models have been proposed to predict the likelihood of live
birth for women desiring elective egg freezing. A model by Doyle et al.
(2016) used outcomes from both fresh and frozen IVF cycles to esti-
mate the oocyte-to-child efficiency for each retrieved oocyte after
stratification by age group. In that study, women 30–34 y with 10 fro-
zen mature oocytes were predicted to have approximately a 60% like-
lihood of having at least one live birth. In contrast, in our study,
women in this age range were predicted to have a 69% likelihood of
live birth. As another example, Doyle et al. found that 35 and 38 year
olds with 20 frozen oocytes would have live birth rates of 80 and 60%,
respectively, whereas our model predicts rates of 90 and 69%. While
our estimates are comparable to those of Doyle et al., the differences
may be driven by our finer categorization of women’s ages by yearly
increments rather than into age groups. Furthermore, Doyle et al. did
not account for euploidy status in their study.
Cobo et al. (2016) retrospectively reviewed outcomes of 137 women
who returned to use vitrified oocytes that were either cryopreserved
electively due to age or for a non-cancer medical condition, including
infertility diagnoses such as endometriosis or low ovarian reserve. In that
study, Kaplan–Meier curves were created to estimate the live birth rate
per oocyte used for women ≤35 and ≥36 y; the authors found that
women ≤35 y who used 10 mature oocytes had a 60.5% likelihood of
live birth, while women ≥36 y who used the same number of oocytes
had a 29.7% likelihood of live birth.
Differences in methodology make direct comparisons between our
study and previous studies challenging. Our study incorporates the
probability of euploidy into the prediction, which is distinct from these
prior studies. Furthermore, these previous analyses were not confined
to otherwise fertile patients, and thus they could be underestimating
the predicted probabilities of live birth. Moreover, both studies pro-
vided predictions by age stratifications rather than by individual age,
and thus may have over- or under-estimated the likelihood of live birth
given the sensitive relationship between age and fertility.
Our prediction analyses relied on several important assumptions.
First, we assumed that the probability of a mature oocyte fertilizing
and blastulating in a frozen–thawed cycle approximates the fertilization
and blastulation rate of a fresh oocyte. This assumption is based on
the fact that IVF outcomes using vitrified oocytes are comparable to
outcomes using fresh oocytes (Cobo et al., 2010; Rienzi et al., 2010;
Doyle et al., 2016; Rienzi et al., 2016). Though well supported in the
literature, a recent JAMA article has suggested that live birth rates fol-
lowing frozen–thawed donor oocyte cycles may be 19% lower than
with fresh donor oocytes (Kushnir et al., 2015). However, that study
has limitations, as it is based on aggregated data and the findings may
have been biased due to the lower number of oocytes available in the
frozen–thaw versus fresh oocyte group. Indeed, if use of frozen
oocytes truly produced inferior results, our live birth predictions may
be falsely elevated. If we were to apply the more conservative estimate
of a 19% lower live birth rate to our model, a 35-year-old woman with
20 mature oocytes retrieved would have a live birth rate of only 73%,
not 90% as our original model suggests.
Second, we assumed that, on average, 60% of euploid blastocysts
would ultimately result in a live birth based on published data, and that
this figure is independent of age (Harton et al., 2013); however, this rate
varies widely among IVF clinics and in the literature (Forman et al., 2013,
2014; Schoolcraft and Katz-Jaffe, 2013; Scott et al., 2013; Fiorentino et al.,
2014). If a woman were to be treated at a clinic with lower success, this
model would overestimate her probability of live birth. Finally, our model
assumes a 95% survival of thawed mature oocytes for women <36 y and
85% for women ≥36 y, values that also vary by study and by center, and
that clearly impact ultimate outcomes (Cobo et al., 2008; Rienzi et al.,
2010; Practice Committees of American Society for Reproductive
Medicine and Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology, 2013;
Cobo et al., 2016). While we found these assumptions appropriate for
our clinical population, individual IVF clinics may need to modify our mod-
el based on their own thaw survival and live birth rates, thereby allowing
for more clinic-specific patient counseling.
Our counseling tool can be used in several ways. First, it can be used
during initial fertility preservation consults to help provide reasonable
expectations regarding the number of mature cryopreserved oocytes
potentially needed for future use, based on the patient’s desired prob-
ability of having at least one, two, or three live birth(s). While our
derived coefficients in Equation 1 are specific to our center, similar
Poisson regressions could be performed using patient data at other
institutions to derive their own blastulation rates. Second, the predic-
tion chart generated from our analysis (Figure 1) may help patients
visualize a reality in oocyte cryopreservation: no matter how many
oocytes are frozen, the likelihood of live birth is not guaranteed and
will never reach 100%. Third, it may help patients decide how many
cycles to undergo, recognizing that there is a point beyond which
undergoing additional cycles would likely bring diminishing returns.
Of note, this tool is designed to help predict live birth rates for
healthy women desiring elective oocyte cryopreservation. Importantly,
this model may overestimate the live birth rate for women undergoing
non-elective oocyte cryopreservation for medical reasons that might
compromise ovarian function, including malignancy.
There are several limitations to this study. Our model is based on a
retrospective chart review of couples using ICSI to treat male-factor
and/or tubal-factor only infertility, or cycles for which egg donation
was used, at a single institution in an insurance-mandated state. It is
possible that our model has underestimated the probability of live
birth for patients wishing to electively cryopreserve oocytes given that
ICSI for male-factor infertility may have a detrimental effect on

 blastocyst formation (Miller and Smith, 2001), and a future partner or
sperm donor may not have infertility. Furthermore, although we
excluded tubal-factor patients with a hydrosalpinx, it is possible that
these patients had inflammatory processes that could negatively
impact oocyte quality, leading to an underestimation of live birth
predictions.
The sample size in older age groups (i.e. women over 38 y) is rela-
tively small, partly because we only included patients with normal
ovarian reserve, which is less likely to be found among older patients.
We excluded embryos transferred on Day 3 from the potential num-
ber of blastocysts, as it is unknown whether these embryos would
have blastulated in culture. This ultimately makes the model slightly
more conservative (i.e. lowers the predicted likelihood of live birth).
As the older patient population was more likely to have had a day
three transfer, this elimination would affect their predictions more
than those of younger patients. Our model may therefore have
reduced accuracy for older populations. Furthermore, in practice,
most IVF centers typically thaw not just one, but a group of oocytes in
preparation for an embryo transfer. If multiple thawed oocytes fertilize
and then develop into blastocysts, supernumerary blastocysts might
then be frozen, leading to the opportunity for multiple freeze/thaw
cycles on oocytes or embryos. Such practice might negatively impact
live birth outcomes, which, in turn, might lead our models to overesti-
mate success. This possibility should be discussed when counseling
patients. As we gain more experience with thawing embryos arising
from thawed oocytes, oocyte thaw strategies may need further refine-
ment to minimize the need for re-thaw. Finally, our assumed post-
thaw oocyte survival rates (95% for women <36 y and 85% for women
≤36 y) may be higher than those observed in other programs, and so
may lead to higher predicted live birth rates. With a less optimistic sur-
vival rate, one would expect a lower predicted live birth rate.
While we attempted to use reasonable, conservative, evidence-
based predictions for oocyte survival and live birth per transferred
euploid blastocyst, it is also possible that these values are too optimistic
and if so, our model would overestimate the likelihood of live birth.
Clearly, the best outcome data to develop a predictive model would be
obtained from women who have undergone oocyte cryopreservation
with vitrification and then returned to use their oocytes. However, at
the present time, there is a paucity of such validation data available.
Concluding remarks
This live birth predictive model was designed using a population of
patients with presumably normal ovarian reserve to serve as a guide for
women considering elective oocyte cryopreservation. As this study is
based on retrospective data, our model should be validated in the future
with a prospective study of women who have electively cryopreserved
and then returned to use oocytes for family-building. Such validation
would be valuable in light of the costs involved not only in the oocyte
cryopreservation process, but also in the annual storage of frozen
oocytes. However, until such prospective data is available, we expect
our tool to provide a valuable resource for physicians and patients.
