Abstract
Background: There has been a rise in research into obesity prevention and treatment programmes in youth,
including the effectiveness of resistance-based exercise. The purpose of this meta-analysis was to examine the
effect of resistance training interventions on weight status in youth.
Methods: Meta-analysis followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses
guidelines and was registered on PROSPERO (registration number CRD42016038365). Eligible studies were from
English language peer-reviewed published articles. Searches were conducted in seven databases between May
2016 and June 2017. Studies were included that examined the effect of resistance training on weight status in
youth, with participants of school age (5–18 years).
Results: There were 24 complete sets of data from 18 controlled trials (CTs) which explored 8 outcomes related to
weight status. Significant, small effect sizes were identified for body fat% (Hedges’ g = 0.215, 95% CI 0.059 to 0.371,
P = 0.007) and skinfolds (Hedges’ g = 0.274, 95% CI 0.066 to 0.483, P = 0.01). Effect sizes were not significant for:
body mass (Hedges’ g = 0.043, 95% CI − 0.103 to 0.189, P = 0.564), body mass index (Hedges’ g = 0.024, 95% CI − 0.205
to 0.253, P = 0.838), fat-free mass (Hedges’ g = 0.073, 95% CI − 0.169 to 0.316, P = 0.554), fat mass (Hedges’ g = 0.180,
95% CI − 0.090 to 0.451, P = 0.192), lean mass (Hedges’ g = 0.089, 95% CI − 0.122 to 0.301, P = 0.408) or waist
circumference (Hedges’ g = 0.209, 95% CI − 0.075 to 0.494, P = 0.149).
Conclusions: The results of this meta-analysis suggest that an isolated resistance training intervention may have an
effect on weight status in youth. Overall, more quality research should be undertaken to investigate the impact of
resistance training in youth as it could have a role to play in the treatment and prevention of obesity.

Background
Obesity is a worldwide concern. In 2016, more than 1.9
billion adults were classified as overweight, 13% were
obese and 41 million children aged under 5 were over-
weight or obese [1]. Childhood obesity is a critical public
health threat as the prevalence of obesity amongst youth
continues to increase worldwide, and there is the risk of

 developing obesity-related diseases at an increasingly
younger age [2]. Prevention and treatment programmes
suitable for youth have been developed for which phys-
ical activity is an integral component [3].
The current guidelines for children aged 5–18 recom-
mend 60 min of daily physical activity (PA), and minimising
the time spent sitting each day. They also recommend ac-
tivity that strengthens muscle and bone, at least 3 days a
week [3, 4]. However, despite these guidelines, one of the
more recent global surveillance studies, the Health Behav-
iour in School-aged Children survey [5], reported that
across Europe, less than 50% of young people were meeting
the current PA guidelines. Additionally, the survey demon-
strated a decline in PA levels with age; 25% of 11 years olds
met the recommendations, compared to just 16% of 15 year
olds [5] which indicates that as children advance to adoles-
cence, sedentary behaviour becomes more common.
A growing volume of studies have now been published
that seek to examine the effectiveness of PA interventions
designed to combat these low levels [6]. However, in a sys-
tematic review of 57 studies that investigated PA interven-
tions in children and adolescents, very few studies that
were included examined interventions which addressed
compliance with the muscle and bone component of the
guidelines [6].
The benefits of resistance training (RT) in youth are
well
documented,
and
key
organisations
(NSCA,
UKSCA and BASES) have developed position state-
ments in support of this [7–9]. A benefit identified in
these position statements is the positive effect of RT on
weight status, although the evidence to support these
statements is not strong. In fact, the majority of re-
search investigates multi-component interventions with
a focus on overweight/obese youths [10–12].
A systematic review in 2011 identified that very few
randomised control trials have examined the effects of
RT alone on body composition in overweight or obese
adolescents [10]. From just seven studies included in this
review that focused on RT alone, the authors reported
inconclusive results and the recommendation was for
more studies to be conducted that concentrate solely on
RT interventions [10]. Also examining the effect of RT
alone on overweight or obese children, a further review
found only six studies met the inclusion criteria [11].
Three out of the six studies showed a significant de-
crease in percentage fat and a significant increase in fat
free mass, although none of the studies found a decrease
in total fat mass. Additionally, all studies reported an
increase in body weight. Again, the findings were incon-
clusive, but they identified there was a lack of rando-
mised control trials (only two studies) and the studies
had low sample sizes [11]. In a systematic review and
meta-analysis, it was found that interventions that in-
cluded a RT component had a very small to small effect
on body composition in overweight and obese youth
[12]. Studies that included interventions that were RT
alone showed similar effects to those studies that in-
cluded resistance plus an aerobic or dietary component.
However, across studies, there was large variation in
intervention content and assessment methods [12].
The studies included in these reviews involved only
overweight and obese participants and therefore it could
be argued that they are focused on the treatment of
obesity rather than prevention. However, it has been
suggested that early prevention holds better than treat-
ment with ‘primordial prevention’ being the first of three
levels of obesity prevention [13]. This emphasises the
prevention of risk factors to maintain a healthy weight
throughout childhood and into the teens [13].
There has been one systematic review to date with
emphasis on the impact of RT on the weight status of
both healthy weight and overweight/obese youth [14].
This review included studies using a variety of assess-
ment tools and also studies that combined aerobic train-
ing and dietary interventions, however, there were still
only 12 studies included in total. Investigating the im-
pact of RT on body composition, they identified that due
to limitations in methodologies it was difficult to reach
conclusions about the isolated role of RT [14].
Since the focus of the published reviews has been on
obese and overweight youth, or on multicomponent inter-
ventions, the isolated role of RT on weight status in youth
is not currently known. Further to this, the only review to
focus on both healthy weight and overweight/obese youth
to date is a decade old. Therefore, the purpose of this re-
view was to systematically examine the impact of resist-
ance training interventions on weight status in youth.
Methods
The search strategy and inclusion criteria were specified
and documented in advance on PROSPERO (number
CRD42016038365). The conduct and reporting of this re-
view adhered to the guidelines outlined in the PRISMA
statement [15]. The PRISMA flow diagram detailing the
systematic search and included studies is shown in Fig. 1.
Search strategy
Electronic literature databases were searched from the year
of their inception up to and including June 2017. These
were PubMed, MEDLINE, ERIC, PsycINFO, Embase, Sport
Discus and Scopus. Relevant references from published lit-
erature were followed up and included when they met the
inclusion criteria and literature not identified in the elec-
tronic searches was sourced. ResearchGate was used to
identify research papers written by key researchers in the
field. Additionally, these researchers were contacted regard-
ing any literature not yet published and the authors of this
review searched their personal libraries.

 The search terms were related to weight status, youths
and RT (Table 1). The Boolean operator “AND” was
used between categories, and the phrase “OR” was used
within categories.
The search strategy was adapted for
each database, and searches were logged.
The screening and data extraction process was under-
taken by HC and AD. Titles of potentially relevant arti-
cles were retrieved using the search strategy, duplicates
then removed, and then the titles and abstracts were
screened by HC. Ten percent (n = 418) of the titles and
abstracts were also screened by AD. The inter-rater reli-
ability for the two authors was found to be Kappa =
0.897 suggesting a strong level of agreement [16].
Full-text copies were obtained for potentially eligible
articles and assessed for inclusion by HC and AD.
During the review of full-text articles, a majority deci-
sion was taken in consultation with the other authors
when
disagreements
regarding
inclusion/exclusion
occurred.
The inclusion/exclusion criteria
Studies with participants of school age between 5 and
18 years were included. No studies were included where
the subject group were identified as having a patho-
logical condition or disability which affects movement,
(e.g. cerebral palsy/dyspraxia) and no studies were in-
cluded where the subject group was identified as having
a behavioural or neuropsychological condition (e.g. aut-
ism or ADHD).
To allow an isolated review of strength training, stud-
ies included RT methods but were excluded if they
contained plyometric, vibration or neuromuscular train-
ing, or training specifically for rehabilitation purposes.
Additionally, studies were excluded if the warm up and
cool down activities were more than 10 min duration
each to ensure there was not a significant aerobic com-
ponent in the intervention. Studies targeting physical ac-
tivity or diet were not included unless both the control
group and intervention group received the same dietary

 and physical activity intervention, but the intervention
group received a different RT input. There was no re-
striction on location (e.g. school based or sports centre)
or timing (e.g. during or after school).
Although studies were included that used a control
group and also those that did not, for the purpose of this
paper, the analysis focused on studies that included a
control group, and therefore are referred to as controlled
trials (CTs). Objective measures included a measure of
weight status through body mass, body mass index
(BMI), skinfolds, DEXA scans, BodPod, MRI scans, waist
circumference, hip circumference or waist to hip ratio.
It is important to note that studies were only included
when weight status was mentioned as an aim of the
study in the abstract and not just as a demographic char-
acteristic of the participants.
Data extraction
Data were extracted using an electronic form by HC and
included study characteristics (e.g. country, year); par-
ticipant characteristics (e.g., age, sex); intervention com-
ponents (e.g. setting, content); and changes in the
outcomes (e.g. change in weight status). The outcome
data were extracted in the form of mean, standard devi-
ation and sample size. If the outcome data was not vis-
ible within the paper, authors were contacted and asked
to provide this data within a set time frame. To
check reliability, AD carried out data extraction on
the first 10% of the included studies, which were in
alphabetical order of the first author. Following this,
any disagreements were resolved through discussion
with all authors.
Methodological quality and risk of bias assessment
The “Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies”
developed by the Effective Public Health Practice Project
in 1998 [17] was used to assess the quality and risk of bias
of the included studies. The results of the assessment lead
to an overall methodological rating of strong, moderate or
weak in eight sections: selection bias, study design, con-
founders, blinding, data, collection methods, withdrawals
and dropouts, intervention integrity and analysis. The as-
sessment tool has been found to be valid and reliable [18].
To check reliability, AD carried out this assessment on
10% of the included studies and any disagreements were
resolved through discussion between the two authors.
Overall, the data extraction and risk of bias accuracy of
one author was deemed to be acceptable.
Meta-analysis
Random effects meta-analyses were conducted with the
Comprehensive Meta-analysis software (version 2.2.064).
Hedges’ g with randomised effects and 95% CIs were cal-
culated for trials with sufficient data. The magnitude of
Hedges’ g was interpreted using Cohen’s (1988) [19] con-
vention as small (0.2), medium (0.5) and large (0.8). A sig-
nificance level of p ≤ 0.05 was applied. Heterogeneity was
assessed using the I2 statistic. For interpretation, I2 values
of 25, 50 and 75 were considered to indicate low, moder-
ate and high heterogeneity, respectively [20]. Publication
bias was assessed by calculating Egger bias statistics [21]
and Rosenthal’s fail-safe N [22]. Corresponding funnel
plots were created.
A moderator analysis was conducted to determine whether
the intervention effects on the outcomes differed by sex of
participants (males or females), sex of training group (i.e. the
training group was designed for either males, females or
mixed sex), weight status (healthy weight, overweight, obese
or mixed weight status), age (< 12 or > 12 years, based on
primary and secondary school age split), pubertal stage
(<Tanner stage 2 or >Tanner stage 2, based on pre-pubertal
and post-pubertal stages), location (school during P.E, school
during free time or community), type of control (no resist-
ance training, nutrition input only, normal activity, wait list)
and quality of study (weak, moderate or strong). Additional
moderator analyses were planned for ethnicity and super-
vised compared to self-regulated sessions. However, there
was insufficient data to allow these analyses. Although data
was also extracted for frequency and duration of interven-
tions, a moderator analysis was not conducted on this data
due to the inappropriateness of separating their independent
and combined impact on training outcomes.
It is important to note that for outcomes where a de-
crease in score was a positive intervention effect (e.g.
BMI) and an increase in score was a positive effect (e.g.
fat free mass), this was accounted for in the analysis.
Results
Out of an initial 6290 studies identified through database
searches, 18 studies met the inclusion criteria and in-
cluded sufficient data for the meta-analysis. Twenty four
data sets were included in the meta-analysis (some stud-
ies had more than one intervention group).
Study characteristics
The surveyed studies were conducted in eight different
countries (USA, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong,
Brazil, Tunisia, Austria and Japan). In total, there were
554 participants in the experimental groups (sample sizes
ranged from 8 to 78 participants) and 599 participants in
the control groups (sample sizes ranging from 5 to 129
participants).
The age of all participants ranged from 8 to 16 years. Eight
outcomes related to weight status were included in the ana-
lysis: body mass (kg), BMI (kg/m2), body fat (%), fat-free
mass (kg), fat mass (kg), lean mass (kg), skinfolds (mm) and
waist circumference (cm). The average attendance for the

 studies that reported it was 88%. The study details included
in the analysis can be found in Table 2.
Synthesis of results
For each study, Hedges’ g was calculated for each outcome
variable to determine an overall intervention effect. Figure 2
illustrates effect sizes for all of the studies and the overall
effect size for each outcome, which ranged from 0.024 to
0.274, indicating a trivial to small intervention effect relative
to controls. Significant intervention effects were identified
for body fat (%) (Hedges’ g = 0.215, 95% CI 0.059 to 0.371,
P = 0.007) and skinfolds (mm) (Hedges’ g = 0.274, 95% CI
0.066 to 0.483, P = 0.01). Effect sizes were not significant
for body mass (Hedges’ g = 0.043, 95% CI − 0.103 to 0.189,
P = 0.564), body mass index (Hedges’ g = 0.024, 95% CI −
0.205 to 0.253, P = 0.838), fat-free mass (Hedges’ g = 0.073,
95% CI − 0.169 to 0.316, P = 0.554), fat mass (Hedges’ g =
0.180, 95% CI − 0.090 to 0.451, P = 0.192), lean mass
(Hedges’ g = 0.089, 95% CI − 0.122 to 0.301, P = 0.408) or
waist circumference (Hedges’ g = 0.209, 95% CI − 0.075 to
0.494, P = 0.149).
Based on the thresholds categorised [20], moderate
to high heterogeneity was identified for BMI and
waist circumference. For all other outcomes, hetero-
geneity was low.
Publication bias
To identify possible publication bias, effect sizes were
plotted against standard errors to generate funnel plots
as illustrated in Fig. 3. There was no indication of publi-
cation bias with no statistically significant result from
Egger’s test [21]. Rosenthal’s fail-safe N [22] found that
241 additional studies would be needed for the cumula-
tive effect to be non-significant. Therefore, it can be
concluded that the meta-analysis provides a satisfactory
representation of the effect of a RT intervention on
weight status.
Quality appraisal
Through the quality appraisal process, 44% of the in-
cluded studies were classified as ‘strong’
, 50% were classi-
fied as ‘moderate’ and 6% were classified as ‘weak’.
Moderator analysis
The results (Table 3) suggest a moderation effect of weight
status on BMI and waist circumference, with significant
differences between healthy weight, mixed weight, over-
weight/obese and obese participants. The results suggest a
moderation effect of quality score on waist circumference,
with significant differences between strong and moderate
studies.
Discussion
Summary of evidence
The purpose of this meta-analysis was to examine the ef-
fect of resistance training (RT) interventions on weight
status in youth. In summary, there was a small, statisti-
cally significant, effect of RT interventions on body fat %
and skinfolds, but no overall significant effect on body
mass, BMI, fat-free mass, fat mass, lean mass or waist
circumference.
The UKSCA’s [8] and NSCA’s [7] position statements
on youth RT both suggest that RT may have a positive
impact on body fat and the significant findings of this
meta-analysis for body fat % and skinfolds support these
statements.
While more studies are required to provide further un-
derstanding of the mechanism underlying a reduction in
body fat due to a RT intervention, it has been reported
that a possible cause could be due to an increase in skel-
etal muscle mass and resulting increase in basal meta-
bolic rate [23], in particular, this has been noted in
adolescents [8]. However, as there were no overall sig-
nificant effect sizes evident for lean mass or fat free mass
in this analysis, this suggests that these changes could
possibly be due to increases in overall energy expend-
iture that may have occurred by simply taking part in an
active intervention, rather than an increase in metabolic-
ally active lean tissue. It is important to note, however,
that with data from both pre-pubertal and post-pubertal
participants included in the analysis, this may have had
an impact on the results.
Although all of the studies that measured fat mass
were in favour of the intervention, this result was not
significant and the effect size was trivial. It is worth con-
sidering why the effects were not consistent across dif-
ferent measures of body fat. Although body scans have
been used in the included studies to measure both body
fat % and fat mass, studies that have used skinfolds to
measure body fat % have also been included in the ana-
lysis. DEXA scans measure both subcutaneous and vis-
ceral fat; however, skinfolds measure subcutaneous fat
only. As there have been variable findings with regards
to the impact of training on different locations of fat
[24–28], this could explain why there were significant
findings for body fat % and skinfolds, but not for fat
mass. This emphasises the importance of validity when
selecting measurement tools and methods used to assess
intervention outcomes indicative of body fat. An add-
itional factor to consider in this meta-analysis is that
there was more than double the number of studies that
investigated body fat % as an outcome in comparison to
fat mass, providing greater statistical power to the find-
ings for body fat %.
Resistance training did not demonstrate a significant
effect on body mass or BMI; however, due to growth,

 these results should be interpreted with caution. Since
the studies included in the analysis assessed a combin-
ation of healthy weight, overweight and obese partici-
pants, changes in these measures over time are likely to
be variable and this is explored further in the moderator
analysis discussed below. For the purpose of this ana-
lysis, a decrease in body mass and BMI was analysed as
a favourable change. However, with the interventions be-
ing resistance based, a subsequent increase in lean mass/
fat-free mass (and therefore body mass) was possible,
and this may have obscured the findings with an overall
positive trend for RT impacting on lean mass and fat
free mass in this analysis. It has been identified that
there is mixed evidence with regards to whether youth
may experience increases in muscle mass following RT,
most likely due to inadequate levels of circulating testos-
terone [7] although it has been suggested that resistance
training may develop lean body mass in adolescents [8].
This will have been exacerbated by the inclusion of
youth from 8 to 16 years of age of varying pubertal sta-
tus and by varying intervention duration. It has also
been suggested that periods of training in excess of
10 weeks are required for increases in lean muscle mass
to occur [10]. In this review, for lean mass, 67% of the
data sets were from studies that included interventions
that were > 10 weeks, and for fat-free mass, these inter-
ventions were > 10 weeks for only 50% of the studies.
This suggests that the intervention duration for several
of the studies may not have been long enough to invoke
positive measurable changes.
For the outcome of waist circumference, there was no
significant effect size evident. With a combination of
healthy weight, overweight and obese participants, it
might be expected that those studies including over-
weight/obese participants would show a larger effect on
waist circumference than the studies that included
healthy weight participants, and this is further explained
by the moderator analysis discussed below. There were
two studies that included obese participants only; one
finding a large effect of the intervention on waist
circumference [29] and the other finding no significant
effect [30]. In the 2004 study, the authors did identify
that with only a 6-week intervention, this may not have
been long enough to have a positive impact on the mea-
sured outcomes. Additionally, only six studies investi-
gated waist circumference as an outcome, and this
outcome therefore had less statistical power than some
of the others.
Previous reviews
Overall, these findings are similar to previous reviews. In
a meta-analysis published in 2013 [12], there was a sig-
nificant effect of interventions including a RT compo-
nent on body fat % in overweight or obese youths. They
also reported no significant effect sizes for body mass,
BMI waist circumference, fat mass or lean mass. Out of
the 40 studies included, only 9 studies were RT-only
studies, and out of these 9, 6 were CTs. However, al-
though interventions were included that also incorpo-
rated an aerobic and/or dietary component, similar
effects were found for studies that included interven-
tions that were RT alone when authors performed a
sub-analysis. There were only three studies included that
incorporated RT only and therefore interpreting the data
should be undertaken with caution.
In a further systematic review [11], only six studies
were included that investigated RT only interventions in
overweight/obese youth. Three out of the six studies
showed a significant decrease in percentage fat and a
significant increase in fat-free mass, although none of

 the studies found a decrease in total fat mass, which is
in support of the findings of this review. Four studies re-
ported significant changes in body composition, with an
increase in fat-free mass and BMI and additionally, all
studies reported an increase in body weight. This is con-
flicting with the current review, although their review

 only included overweight and obese youth. Unlike the
studies in the current analysis, all studies in their review
included RT of moderate to submaximal intensity during
treatment, rather than high intensity work and while ac-
knowledging the limitations of using percentage of 1RM
to prescribe intensity, higher intensity work (however
calculated) will provide a greater stimulus for overload
than low-medium intensity work. This may have had an
impact on their overall findings with regards to weight
status, as high intensity work has been reported as a key
component to elicit changes in body composition [10].
Supporting the variable findings with regards to the im-
pact of RT on obese adolescents, inconclusive results
were found from just seven studies included that focused
on RT alone [10].
In the only systematic review to date that included
both healthy weight and overweight/obese participants,
12 studies were included [14]. It was reported that for
CTs, no studies found a significant change in BMI body
fat, two studies reported a change in lean body mass and
one study that reported a change in waist circumference.
In their review, there were only five RCTs and three of
these included a dietary and/or aerobic component. The
interventions were also different to the current review
with all but two of the RT interventions being circuit
based.
Overall, with just one of the reviews described above
including a meta-analysis, it makes comparisons with
the current meta-analysis somewhat challenging.
Moderator analysis
To investigate the findings further, a moderator analysis
was completed on all outcomes to identify if any effects
could be explained by specific moderator variables. It
was found that weight status was a moderator for BMI
and waist circumference, and these outcomes showed
moderate and high heterogeneity respectively and there-
fore the variance between studies could be explained by
weight status. All other outcomes did not display signifi-
cant heterogeneity, and no significant findings were ap-
parent from the moderator analysis (Table 2).
There was a significant effect of the intervention on
the BMI and waist circumference of obese participants
(Table 2) but not on other weight categories, indicating
that RT could be an effective intervention on these out-
comes in obese individuals. It would seem plausible that
BMI and waist circumference outcomes would vary sig-
nificantly across studies due to the inclusion of both
healthy weight and overweight/obese participants. It has
been reported that obese youth are more sedentary than
their healthy weight peers [31] and require more energy
to move [32]. Therefore, an increase in physical activity
might have a larger relative increase in energy expend-
iture reflected in reduced BMI and waist circumference.
It should be noted, however, that for waist circumfer-
ence, there were only six studies included in the analysis.
Three were mixed weight with one study each for obese,
overweight and healthy weight participants. This small
number of studies may explain the high heterogeneity,
and therefore interpreting the results should be under-
taken cautiously. Additionally, a longer term follow up
study would be beneficial to investigate resistance train-
ing as an obesity prevention method.
These findings conflict with previous findings [12] that
suggested that there was a very small moderation effect
of age and sex on various weight status outcomes. It was
reported that for youth 12 years or older, there was an
intervention effect on body mass, BMI, waist circumfer-
ence, body fat %, fat mass and lean mass, and for males,
there was an intervention effect on body mass, BMI,
body fat % and fat mass. However, these were small in-
fluences on intervention effects, and their analysis in-
cluded studies that incorporated an aerobic or dietary
component which is different to the analysis in the
current review and therefore it is difficult to make con-
clusions regarding RT alone based on their findings.
Strengths and limitations
There were a number of strengths to this review. There
should be strong confidence in the main findings given
the rigorous review process. A strict inclusion/exclusion
criteria resulted in an analysis of 24 data sets that exam-
ined the effects of RT on weight status in 554 youths
from 8 countries.
This is also the first meta-analysis to include healthy
weight and overweight/obese participants taking part in
RT only interventions, which is important to identify the
impact of RT not only as a treatment for obesity but also
as a prevention.
There was high compliance reported in the included
studies. For the studies who reported it, compliance was
88%. As well as a strength of the current meta-analysis,
high compliance adds substance to the potential for RT
as a viable mode of intervention to improve weight
status.
There are however limitations that need to be consid-
ered when interpreting the results. There was large vari-
ability within the study interventions with regards to
participant numbers (ranging from 5 to 129 participants),
frequency, duration and programme content. The fre-
quency ranged from 2 to 6 times a week and duration
ranged from 8 to 20 weeks. Programmes also involved a
mixture of sets and reps with a range of intensities and
some being circuit based. The forest plots also indicate
large variation with the individual studies’ results.
For certain outcomes there were a variety of different
methods of measurement. For example, body fat % was
measured by DEXA, BodPod, bioelectrical impedance
Collins et al. Sports Medicine - Open  (2018) 4:41 
Page 14 of 16
 scales, skinfolds and MRI scanning. While reporting
standardised mean differences allowed us to pool the
data for the purposes of the meta-analysis, differences
between measurement tools should be acknowledged.
A limitation of the moderator analysis was not all of
the studies reported data to enable a thorough investiga-
tion, so limited conclusions can be made based on this
additional, incomplete level of analysis.
Finally, there was a mixture of quality of the studies in-
cluded, with only 44% of the studies classified as ‘strong’.
When moderating for quality of studies, it is difficult to
make conclusions despite there being significant findings
for waist circumference, as there was only one ‘strong’
study for this outcome. This had a large effect size in com-
parison to the ‘moderate’ and ‘weak’ studies.
Conclusions
The literature suggests that RT may have a positive effect on
weight status in youth, although the effects have not been
clearly established and it is clear that more quality research is
required to investigate this further. This meta-analysis pro-
vides an overview of the current research evidence and an
insight into the potential benefits of such interventions. It
adds to previous systematic reviews by including both
healthy weight and overweight/obese youths and including
RT only interventions which explores not only the treatment
of obesity, but also prevention which is a vital component in
combatting rising levels of obesity in children.
Overall, this meta-analysis found a small, statistically
significant effect of RT interventions on body fat % and
skinfolds, but no overall significant effect on body mass,
BMI, fat free mass, fat mass, lean mass or waist circum-
ference. While we can conclude that RT interventions
have a small positive impact on some indicators of
weight status, it is noted that this reflects only a small
body of published work.
With RT interventions offering potential benefits for
youth with regards to weight status, it is imperative that
more robust and quality studies should be conducted to
further, and unequivocally, investigate the role RT may
play in the treatment and prevention of obesity. Based
on the findings of this meta-analysis, and in support of
the conclusions of previous reviews, future studies
should be designed as randomised controlled trials with
large samples and include a treatment group with an
isolated RT intervention. There should be careful
consideration into appropriate intervention content
and assessment methods. If validated, this type of inter-
vention, as recommended by the UK and WHO phys-
ical activity guidelines, could ultimately have a positive
impact on the prevalence of common obesity-related
diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease
and cancer, and improve the health of individuals not
only during childhood but as they progress through life.
