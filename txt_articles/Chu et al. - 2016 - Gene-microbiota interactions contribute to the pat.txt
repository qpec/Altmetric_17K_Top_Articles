 its function by affecting ATP binding (11). Thus,
the F548L polymorphism is expected to reduce
the ability of Pmr1BY to transport manganese
into the Golgi, relative to Pmr1RM, consistent with
BY’s manganese sensitivity.
Pmr1 leucine-548 is conserved across fungi,
with some species having an isoleucine or valine
at the homologous position and none with phenyl-
alanine (fig. S5). In the S. cerevisiae population,
almost all sequenced PMR1 alleles have leucine-
548, with phenylalanine-548 found only in BY
and other laboratory strains (12, 13) whose PMR1
alleles are likely directly related to BY (14). BY is
derived from EM93, a diploid strain isolated
from a fig (15). Sequencing of PMR1 in EM93
revealed that EM93 is heterozygous for Pmr1-
F548L (fig. S6), suggesting that either the muta-
tion is not laboratory-derived or that it occurred
between EM93’s isolation and its entry into a
stock collection.
Decades of mapping studies have uncovered
loci for myriad traits, but identification of the
underlying genes and variants has lagged. Our
CRISPR-assisted mapping approach promises to
close this gap. In contrast to previous strategies,
our method generates a higher density of recom-
bination events, is easily targetable to any region of
the genome, and does not require time-consuming
extra generations of crossing to increase recombi-
nation frequency. Conversely, the strength of a
traditional meiotic mapping panel is the ability
to scan the entire genome. Complex traits, with
multiple small-effect QTLs, pose a greater chal-
lenge for any mapping method. Importantly, in
LOH mapping the rest of the genome outside the
region targeted for LOH is held constant when
a given QTL is being queried, thus effectively re-
ducing the complexity of a trait by eliminating
variance due to other segregating QTLs.
We anticipate that trait mapping with targeted
LOH panels will aid efforts to understand the
genetic basis of trait variation. In addition to ap-
plications in single-celled organisms, LOH panels
could be generated from cultured cells, enabling
in vitro genetic dissection of human traits with
cellular phenotypes. In multicellular organisms,
mapping resolution could be enhanced with
CRISPR-directed meiotic recombination events.
Indeed, the mutagenic chain reaction system de-
veloped in vivo in fruit flies (16) and mosquitos
(17, 18) uses CRISPR to generate gene conversion
events in meiosis with high efficiency. Addition-
ally, LOH in early development could generate
chimeric individuals. The targeted LOH method
also has the potential to be applied to viable inter-
species hybrids that cannot produce offspring, al-
lowing trait variation between species to be studied
genetically beyond the few systems where it is cur-
rently possible (19, 20).
In addition to their research applications,
targetable endonucleases hold promise for gene
therapy (21, 22). Certain disease alleles may be
difficult to directly target by CRISPR because of
their sequence complexity, such as the expanded
trinucleotide repeats that underlie Huntington’s
disease. In these cases, directing a DSB to occur
in the vicinity of a pathogenic allele so that it is
replaced with its nonpathogenic counterpart by
LOH may represent a more feasible alternative.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with risk variants in the human
genome and dysbiosis of the gut microbiome, though unifying principles for these
findings remain largely undescribed. The human commensal Bacteroides fragilis
delivers immunomodulatory molecules to immune cells via secretion of outer
membrane vesicles (OMVs). We reveal that OMVs require IBD-associated genes,
ATG16L1 and NOD2, to activate a noncanonical autophagy pathway during protection
from colitis. ATG16L1-deficient dendritic cells do not induce regulatory T cells (Tregs) to
suppress mucosal inflammation. Immune cells from human subjects with a major risk
variant in ATG16L1 are defective in Treg responses to OMVs. We propose that
polymorphisms in susceptibility genes promote disease through defects in “sensing”
protective signals from the microbiome, defining a potentially critical gene-environment
etiology for IBD.
I
ntestinal microbiota modulate development
and function of the immune system and play
a critical role in inflammatory bowel disease
(IBD), a family of idiopathic intestinal dis-
orders including Crohn’s disease (CD) and
ulcerative colitis (UC) (1–6). Concordance rates
of 40 to 50% between monozygotic twins impli-
cate gene-environment interactions in the patho-
genesis of CD (7–10), albeit in ways that are poorly
understood. Advances in DNA-sequencing tech-
nologies have empowered unprecedented insights
into the human genome and the gut microbiome
in IBD, enabling detailed genomic characteriza-
tion of patients (11) and chronicling alterations
in the composition and gene content of the gut
microbiome (dysbiosis) (12).

 Close to 200 risk loci have been proposed
for CD, with several susceptibility genes linked
to the regulation of autophagy (e.g., autophagy-
related 16–like 1, ATG16L1) (13–15) or to microbial
sensors that activate autophagy [e.g., nucleotide-
binding oligomerization domain–containing pro-
tein 2 (NOD2)] (16–18). Although previous studies
have shown that disruption of ATG16L1 and
NOD2 affects CD susceptibility through defects
in microbial clearance (19–23), recent reports re-
veal that immune cells impaired in autophagy are
hyperinflammatory (24–29). This suggests that
deficiencies in ATG16L1 or NOD2 may contribute
to CD risk through impaired anti-inflammatory
responses, a hypothesis not mutually exclusive
with microbial clearance functions.
The microbiome of CD patients is altered, with
emerging evidence for cause-and-effect relation-
ships to disease. Among other recent examples
of host-microbe interactions (3, 5, 6), the human
commensal Bacteroides fragilis has evolved be-
neficial immunomodulatory properties. During
colonization of mice, B. fragilis capsular poly-
saccharide A (PSA) is packaged in outer mem-
brane vesicles (OMVs) and delivered to intestinal
dendritic cells (DCs) to induce interleukin-10
(IL-10) production from CD4+Foxp3+ regulatory
T cells (Tregs), which protects from experimental
colitis (30–32). To explore gene-environment
interactions during host-microbiota symbiosis,
we tested if genetic pathways linked to CD are
involved in the immune response to B. fragilis
OMVs.
Bone marrow–derived DCs (BMDCs) differen-
tiated from wild-type (WT) and ATG16L1-deficient
(Atg16l1 fl/fl Cd11c-Cre; Atg16l1DCd11c) mice were
pulsed with OMVs harvested from wild-type
B. fragilis (WT-OMV), or an isogenic mutant lacking
PSA (DPSA-OMV), and cocultured with CD4+
T cells. As previously reported (33), WT-OMVs,
but not vehicle or DPSA-OMVs, promote IL-10
production (Fig. 1, A to C, and fig. S1). Con-
versely, ATG16L1-deficient DCs do not support IL-
10 production in response to WT-OMVs (Fig. 1, A
to C). We observe similar results using Atg16l1 fl/fl
LysM-Cre mice (fig. S3). Purified PSA does not
require ATG16L1 for its activity (Fig. 1, A and C,
and fig. S2). Next, we tested functional outcomes
using in vitro T cell suppression assays. Tregs iso-
lated from cocultures with Atg16l1DCd11c BMDCs
treated with B. fragilis OMVs exhibit impaired
suppressive activity (Fig. 1D and fig. S2A). Neither
WT-OMVs nor pure PSA have any effect on IL-10
production among CD4+Foxp3– type 1 regulatory
T cells (fig. S4). ATG16L1, ATG5, and ATG7 are
components of the autophagy elongation com-
plex; BMDCs deleted in these genes likewise
do not induce IL-10 production from Tregs (fig. S5).
Further, recent reports reveal a role for autoph-
agy components in Treg homeostasis (34, 35).
Our findings indicate that ATG16L1-deficient
DCs fail to respond to B. fragilis OMVs, demon-
strating that autophagy components in DCs are
required for commensal-driven Treg induction
and function.
ATG16L1, ATG5, and ATG7 participate in both
canonical and noncanonical autophagy pathways
(36). Interestingly, the classical autophagy-specific
genes Ulk1, Fip200, or Atg14 are not required for
CD4+Foxp3+IL-10+ Treg induction upon WT-OMV
treatment (fig. S6). We hypothesized that OMVs
use the noncanonical autophagy pathway, LC3-
associated phagocytosis (LAP), which is specifically
activated by microbial ligands delivered as
particles rather than as soluble molecules. LAP

 activation requires RUBICON, which represses
canonical autophagy (36). Rubicon+/− but not
Rubicon−/− BMDCs display increased accumula-
tion of lipidated, membrane-bound LC3-GFP (green
fluorescent protein) (LC3-II) upon B. fragilis
WT-OMV treatment (Fig. 1E). As expected, neither
DPSA-OMVs nor purified PSA are able to activate
LAP (fig. S7). Moreover, treatment of Rubicon–/–
DCs fails to induce Treg responses (Fig. 1F). As
RUBICON is upstream of ATG16L1 signaling,
OMVs preferentially use the noncanonical au-
tophagy pathway LAP to mediate tolerogenic re-
sponses to B. fragilis. Further, these data suggest
a reconsideration of previous literature assigning
the role of ATG16L1 in IBD to defects exclusively
in autophagy.
As a CD-risk gene, we investigated the in vivo
requirement for ATG16L1 in CD11c+ DCs during
OMV-mediated protection from experimental colitis.
Indeed, WT mice treated by oral gavage with WT-
OMVs are protected from 2,4-dinitrobenzenesulfonic
acid (DNBS) colitis (33), whereas Atg16l1DCd11c mice
exhibit acute weight loss and increased mortality
similar to that of untreated mice (Fig. 2A and fig.
S8A). WT, but not Atg16l1DCd11c, mice orally ad-
ministered OMVs are protected from shortening
of the colon, a hallmark of colitis models (Fig. 2B),
with colitis scoring and cytokine profiles verifying
protection from disease (Fig. 2C and fig. S8B).
Prevention of colitis is not due to an overall de-
fect in Treg development in Atg16l1DCd11c mice
(fig. S9). Further, although proportions of
CD4+Foxp3+ cells are comparable in all groups of
mice during colitis (fig. S10), Atg16l1DCd11c mice
produce significantly less IL-10 from gut Foxp3+
Tregs compared to WT mice after WT-OMV treat-
ment (Fig. 2D and fig. S8C). Thus, WT-OMVs
require ATG16L1 within DCs to induce IL-10 ex-
pression from Foxp3+ Tregs and to suppress intes-
tinal inflammation in a colitis model.
In addition to impaired IL-10 production in
response to OMV treatment, Atg16l1DCd11c mice
display an increase in IL-17A expression (Fig. 2E),
but not IFN-g (fig. S11), among mucosal CD4+Foxp3+
T cells during colitis. Further, in vitro cocultures
of OMV-pulsed Atg16l1DCd11c BMDCs result in
impaired IL-10 expression among Tregs (Fig. 1C)
and increased IL-17A production in CD4+Foxp3+
T cells (fig. S12). Interestingly, whereas OMVs
from other enteric bacteria each elicited a unique
ATG16L1-dependent immune profile, only B. fragilis
OMVs exclusively induce an anti-inflammatory re-
sponse (fig. S13). Together, these data suggest that
ATG16L1 deficiency in DCs alters the quality of the
T cell response to OMVs.
As DCs coordinate adaptive immunity, we sought
to determine how Atg16l1DCd11c DCs are impaired
in promoting tolerogenic responses. After OMV
stimulation, we observe no differences by WT or
Atg16l1DCd11c DCs in internalizing OMVs or in
surface expression of major histocompatibility
complex class II (MHC II), CD80, and CD86 (fig.
S14) (27). However, stimulation with OMVs results
in an increase transcription of multiple proinflam-
matory cytokines in Atg16l1DCd11c DCs compared
to WT cells (fig. S15). These data are consistent
with previous reports of a hyperinflammatory
response in ATG16L1-deficient macrophages and
DCs stimulated with other microbial ligands
(24, 26). Abrogation of Treg responses by ATG16L1-
deficient DCs is likely due to increased proinflam-
matory cytokine production, which may impair
DC–T cell interactions. Atg16l1DCd11c mice do not
display more severe colitis than WT mice in the
absence of OMV treatment (Fig. 2), suggesting that
lack of protection is not due to more fulminant
inflammation, but rather to an inability to in-
duce Tregs in mice deficient in ATG16L1 among
CD11c+ DCs.
NOD2 encodes an intracellular sensor of bac-
terial peptidoglycan, and polymorphisms in this
gene contribute to the largest fraction of genetic
risk for CD (13). NOD2 has been shown to
physically recruit ATG16L1 (20, 21), a process
that is impaired in human cells homozygous for
a NOD2 frameshift mutation (20). Accordingly,
Nod2−/− BMDCs pulsed with WT-OMVs are un-
able to support IL-10 production from Foxp3+
Tregs during in vitro cocultures (Fig. 3, A and B),
revealing a crucial role for NOD2 signaling in
microbiome-mediated immune tolerance. This
notion is supported by in vivo studies showing
that Nod2−/− mice are not protected from colitis
by WT-OMV treatment (Fig. 3, C and D). Similar
to Atg16l1DCd11c animals, Nod2−/− mice produce
significantly less IL-10 from Foxp3+ Tregs of the
mesenteric lymph node (MLN) after WT-OMV
treatment (fig. S16A), and proportions of Tregs re-
main unchanged during DNBS colitis (fig. S16B).
Previous studies have shown that Toll-like receptor
2 (TLR2) is required for the PSA response (33, 37).
Although the role of NOD2 in inducing LAP is
currently unknown, signaling through TLR2 po-
tently activates LAP (36, 38). B. fragilis OMVs
induce reactive oxygen species from WT DCs,

 a known product of LAP activation (36), but at
significantly reduced levels in Nod2−/− or Tlr2−/−
DCs (fig. S17). Though further studies are needed
to define the mechanism of LAP activation by
OMVs, these data reveal that NOD2 and ATG16L1
may cooperate as part of a common pathway to
promote anti-inflammatory immune responses to
the microbiome.
To extend and validate gene deletion approaches,
we tested responses to OMVs by immune cells
carrying the CD-associated variant of ATG16L1
(13, 14, 39). The ATG16L1 T300A variant leads to
protein instability and altered cellular responses
(23). BMDCs from transgenic mice expressing the
T300A allele are also unable to promote IL-10
expression from Foxp3+ Tregs in response to WT-
OMVs (fig. S18A). Further, ATG16L1 T300A trans-
genic mice are not protected from DNBS colitis
and do not mount a potent Treg response when
administered WT-OMV compared to WT mice
(fig. S18, B to G). These findings prompted us
to investigate if human immune cells from CD
patients with the ATG16L1 T300A risk variant
(table S1) are also defective in promoting Foxp3+
Treg development by B. fragilis OMVs. Monocyte-
derived dendritic cells (MoDCs) from CD patients
and healthy controls harboring either the protec-
tive allele (T300) or the risk allele (A300) were
pulsed with OMVs or PSA and cocultured with
syngeneic CD4+ T cells. Consistent with our mouse
data, human cells homozygous for the risk allele
are unable to support induction of IL-10 from
Foxp3+ Tregs by WT-OMVs compared to MoDCs
carrying the protective allele (Fig. 4). Notably,
all samples tested display the predicted out-
come based on genotype and not disease status.
However, cells from most subjects, regardless of
genotype, respond to purified PSA (Fig. 4). Col-
lectively, we conclude that mouse and human
DCs require functional ATG16L1 for induction
of CD4+Foxp3+IL-10+ Tregs in response to B. fragilis
OMVs.
IBD affects more than 1.5 million people in
the United States, with rates of diagnosis in-
creasing and treatment options remaining limited
(40, 41). The etiology of IBD is complex and in-
completely resolved (1). Here, we describe how
interactions between genetic (ATG16L1/NOD2)
and environmental (microbiome) factors coop-
erate to promote beneficial immune responses.
B. fragilis OMVs use LAP, an ATG16L1-dependent
cellular trafficking and signaling pathway, to
induce mucosal tolerance. The hyperinflammatory
responses that occur with mutations in ATG16L1
likely alter antigen-processing pathways and im-
pair signaling by DCs to T cells and may explain
why CD-associated polymorphisms abrogate Treg
induction by OMVs. Collectively, discovery of
genetic circuits co-opted by the microbiome to
engender health provides unprecedented func-
tional insights into gene-environment interactions
relevant to the pathogenesis of IBD. We propose
an additional role for genes previously impli-
cated in killing bacteria—namely, mutations in
genetic pathways linked to IBD result in an in-
ability to sense and/or respond to beneficial
microbes. This hypothesis may represent a new
perspective for the etiology of microbiome-related
diseases.

Fig. 4. The T300A risk variant of ATG16L1 in human cells is unable to support OMV responses. (A and B) MoDCs with either the protective (A) or
risk (B) allele were treated with PBS, B. fragilis WT-OMV, DPSA-OMV, or purified PSA; washed; and cocultured with syngeneic CD4+ Tcells. IL-10 expression was
analyzed by flow cytometry among CD4+Foxp3+ T
regs. Human samples were processed and analyzed in a blinded fashion. CTL, control subjects; CD, Crohn’s
disease subjects. Error bars represent SEM. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001; ns, not significant. One-way ANOVA, followed by T
