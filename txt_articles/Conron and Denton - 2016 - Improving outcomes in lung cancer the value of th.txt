Abstract: Lung cancer is a major worldwide health burden, with high disease-related morbid-
ity and mortality. Unlike other major cancers, there has been little improvement in lung cancer 
outcomes over the past few decades, and survival remains disturbingly low. Multidisciplinary 
care is the cornerstone of lung cancer treatment in the developed world, despite a relative lack 
of evidence that this model of care improves outcomes. In this article, the available literature 
concerning the impact of multidisciplinary care on key measures of lung cancer outcomes 
is reviewed. This includes the limited observational data supporting improved survival with 
multidisciplinary care. The impact of multidisciplinary care on other benchmark measures of 
quality lung cancer treatment is also examined, including staging accuracy, access to diagnostic 
investigations, improvements in clinical decision making, better utilization of radiotherapy 
and palliative care services, and improved quality of life for patients. Health service research 
suggests that multidisciplinary care improves care coordination, leading to a better patient 
experience, and reduces variation in care, a problem in lung cancer management that has been 
identified worldwide. Furthermore, evidence suggests that the multidisciplinary model of 
care overcomes barriers to treatment, promotes standardized treatment through adherence to 
guidelines, and allows audit of clinical services and for these reasons is more likely to provide 
quality care for lung cancer patients. While there is strengthening evidence suggesting that the 
multidisciplinary model of care contributes to improvements in lung cancer outcomes, more 
quality studies are needed.

Introduction
Lung cancer accounts for a large burden of disease worldwide, being in the top five most 
commonly diagnosed cancers. In 2012, more than 210,000 new cases were diagnosed in 
the US, 44,000 in the UK, and 10,000 in Australia.1–3 Despite being only the fourth-most 
commonly diagnosed malignancy in developed nations, lung cancer is the number-one 
cause of cancer death worldwide, responsible for 1.59 million deaths in 2012 alone.1,4 
In the US alone, more than 157,000 people died from lung cancer in 2012.2
Over the last few decades, there has been only a gradual and very modest improve-
ment in lung cancer survival, which remains dismally low, with only 14.1% and 5% 
of patients diagnosed with lung cancer surviving 5 and 10 years, respectively.5 It is 
estimated that 89% of cases are preventable, and unlike other cancers we have not 
seen major improvements in lung cancer mortality over time.3,5 In addition to high 
disease-related mortality, lung cancer is also a major cause of morbidity, consistently 
rating within the top ten conditions causing the highest burden of disease.6 The high

disease-related morbidity and mortality make improving lung 
cancer outcomes a high priority.
In the past two decades, multidisciplinary care – the treat-
ment of patients via direct collaboration of specialists – has 
emerged as the standard of care in cancer management.7–11 
In 2007, a European Union health services review  
committee 
published guidelines suggesting that “a multidisciplinary 
approach to cancer care is required to make the best decisions 
about each patient’s diagnosis, treatment and support”.12 In 
the US, the “tumor board” is a requirement for accreditation 
of centers providing multidisciplinary cancer care regulated 
by the American College of Surgeons and the Commission 
on Cancer; discussions must occur at least monthly, with 
prospective review of cases and management decisions.13,14 
Through the development of guidelines and regulations such 
as these, multidisciplinary care has evolved into the standard 
of care in many parts of the world, despite a relative paucity of 
quality evidence that it improves survival and other outcomes 
in lung cancer.1,15,16
Health services research that includes studies of patterns 
of care in lung cancer treatment has identified measures 
of quality treatment in lung cancer. These include time to 
specialist referral, time between diagnosis and initiation of 
treatment, utilization of specialist investigations, including 
endobronchial ultrasound and positron-emission tomography, 
discussion at a multidisciplinary meeting (MDM) or tumor 
board, and access to surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, 
and clinical trials.1,17–21 Furthermore, qualify-of-life research 
has identified that such factors as communication by health 
professionals, process streamlining, and the presence of 
nurse coordinators improve patient experience of the lung 
cancer journey.22,23 While there is limited evidence to date 
that multidisciplinary care improves these quality indicators 
of lung cancer treatment, intuitively it would seem likely to 
be the case. Further studies are required in this important 
area of health services research.
Despite the lack of evidence supporting this model of 
care, the utilization of multidisciplinary teams (MDTs) has 
increased dramatically in Europe and the US in recent times. 
Twenty years ago in the UK, ,20% of cancer patients were 
managed by an MDT; by 2004, this number was .80%.24 In 
the US, one large observational study showed that 53.8% of 
physicians attended tumor boards weekly, 42% attended less 
often, and only 4.2% did not attend at all.25 It has become 
increasingly difficult to perform randomized trials to investi-
gate the impact of multidisciplinary care, due to the difficulty 
in recruiting patients from centers where this model is not the 
standard of care. As a result, we largely rely on observational 
studies to evaluate the value of multidisciplinary care. 
Confounding the interpretation of studies investigating the 
role of multidisciplinary care in cancer management is the 
parallel introduction of improvements in therapeutics, eg, 
small-molecule tyrosine-kinase inhibitors that have been 
shown to confer survival benefits for lung cancer patients. 
Despite these difficulties in study design, there is an increas-
ing body of literature suggesting that multidisciplinary care 
improves numerous aspects of lung cancer care, including 
but not limited to survival.
Defining the multidisciplinary 
health care team
Different definitions of multidisciplinary care exist. The 
most inclusive definition is of “an integrated team approach 
to health care in which medical and allied health care 
professionals consider all relevant treatment options and 
develop collaboratively an individual treatment plan for each 
patient”.26 An important aspect of multidisciplinary care is an 
emphasis on patient-centered care and an attempt to improve 
the patient journey through communication, collaboration, 
and streamlining of diagnostics and therapeutics.
The medical members of a lung cancer MDT would 
typically include a respiratory physician, medical oncolo-
gist, radiation oncologist, cardiothoracic surgeon, patholo-
gist, radiologist, and a palliative care physician.1,9,15,16,26–30 
Additionally, the presence of nursing coordinators and allied 
health staff is considered by many necessary to coordinate 
and deliver the best-quality multidisciplinary care.27 An inclu-
sive MDT should provide the best opportunity for optimal 
care, incorporating all involved specialties at the outset and 
facilitating critical discussion.31,32
Leadership
Leadership of the MDM is critical to facilitate open discus-
sion, including any disagreements, allowing the consideration 
of all opinions across the specialties, not just the view of the 
person with the loudest voice.8,32 Good leadership is impor-
tant in the discussion process and also to keep the meetings 
on track. It is important that the leader of the discussion is 
respected by all members of the MDT, and that they feel com-
fortable voicing their opinions.32 Furthermore, a leader can 
provide feedback to the MDT and audit outcomes to ensure 
participants are encouraged to perform at their optimum.8
Communication
Key to the process of MDT management is communica-
tion. Intuitively, communication within the MDT and

improving lung cancer outcomes with MDT care
with patients and family members should be of critical 
importance in the delivery of successful multidisciplinary 
care, but there is little evidence to support this assumption.8 
With a large number of health professionals involved in 
a patient’s care, effective communication with a patient’s 
primary care physician is important and is generally the 
task of a dedicated member of the MDT.28 Patient involve-
ment or a consumer representative at MDMs is not com-
mon practice, with .95% of MDMs exclusively involving 
health professionals.33
Resources
Adequate facilities for MDMs are essential to ensure that 
there is effective information sharing and communication 
among the different specialties.27 This includes information 
technology that allows projection of radiology and pathol-
ogy results that can be viewed by all the members of the 
MDT.26 Ideally, a dedicated data-management system should 
be available to upload information into an electronic medi-
cal record.26 For many MDMs, teleconference facilities are 
required to allow participation by team members who may 
be unable to attend the meeting in person or are located in 
rural or remote areas. There is evidence that teleconferenc-
ing may improve attendance at MDMs without negatively 
impacting patient care.19
Impact of multidisciplinary care on 
lung cancer outcomes
As previously discussed, measuring the effects of multi-
disciplinary care on outcomes in lung cancer is difficult, 
because of the inability to perform randomized trials and the 
confounding effects of more effective therapeutics on inter-
preting observational studies.8 The effect of multidisciplinary 
care is herein initially discussed in relation to the outcomes of 
survival and mortality, and then in relation to other measures 
of quality lung cancer care. These other measures include the 
facilitation of timely care, access to diagnostic investigations, 
quality of staging, treatment delivered, and completeness of 
ongoing surveillance and follow-up. Finally, the effect of 
multidisciplinary care on patient-centered outcomes, such as 
quality of life, is discussed. 22 A summary of the key studies 
pertaining to multidisciplinary care and lung cancer outcomes 
is provided (Table 1).
Survival
There is an increasing body of evidence from observational 
studies involving other tumor types that multidisciplinary 
cancer care improves survival. In breast cancer, there is 
evidence that outcomes are improved in cases where surgeons 
operate on .30 cases per year in an MDT setting.34 Likewise, 
in a group of Scottish patients with ovarian cancer, retrospec-
tive data suggested that referral to a multidisciplinary clinic 
was an independent predictor of improved survival.35 There 
have been similar results reflected in the field of head and 
neck cancer, with one study finding improved survival in a 
group of patients who were managed in a multidisciplinary 
clinic versus those who were not seen in the clinic.36 One 
prospective study in the UK compared patients with esopha-
geal cancer who were managed with multidisciplinary care 
to a historical cohort, and found that the multidisciplinary 
care group had less operative mortality and improved 5-year 
survival.37 Similar results have been seen in nonsolid organ 
tumors, with Davis et al demonstrating that the mortality of 
Hodgkin’s disease was 50% higher even when adjusted for 
patient age and stage among those not treated at compre-
hensive cancer centers where a multidisciplinary approach 
was the standard of care.38 In colorectal cancer, Morris 
et al found a statistically significant improvement in 5-year 
survival when there was improved adherence to guideline-
based therapy by MDTs, after adjustment for multiple other 
prognostic factors.39
In regard to the effect of multidisciplinary care on lung 
cancer survival, there remains a relative paucity of data.7,10,40 
In the absence of randomized trials, we rely on observational 
studies (with their recognized limitations) to provide us with 
evidence for multidisciplinary care conferring improved 
survival. In one prospective, single-center observational 
study, all patients with inoperable lung cancer were identi-
fied over a period of 1 year and outcomes assessed, includ-
ing survival.7 While there was no significant difference in 
treatment received, improved survival was observed in the 
group discussed at an MDM in comparison to the group 
that was not discussed.7 The results of this study should be 
interpreted with caution, due to the single-center observa-
tional nature of the study, as it is possible that significant 
differences existed between patients discussed at the MDM 
and those who were not. Another retrospective cohort-based 
study examined patients with inoperable non-small-cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC) recruited from a single center in Scotland 
before and after the introduction of MDTs.10 It was observed 
that there was an increased proportion of patients staged and 
more chemotherapy utilized, with fewer patients receiving 
supportive care only in the post-MDT cohort compared to 
pre-MDT implementation.10 Additionally, patients post-MDT 
implementation had significantly improved survival, with a 
median survival of 6.6 months compared to 3.2 months in the

pre-MDT cohort.10 Criticisms of this study have included the 
possible bias introduced by the time difference between the 
two cohorts (1997 versus 2001), which coincided with 
improvements in the treatment of advanced lung cancer. 
Not all studies investigating the effect of multidisci-
plinary management on cancer outcomes have been posi-
tive, with some demonstrating conflicting results. A large 
observational study of more than 9,000 patients in the US 
revealed that there was little evidence that physician involve-
ment in tumor boards improved overall survival in lung and 
colorectal cancer, although there were a number of limita-
tions to this analysis.25 In this study, higher mortality was 
observed in patients who were discussed at MDMs where 
multiple cancers were discussed compared to MDMs where 
a single cancer type was discussed, suggesting that MDMs 
may result in a dilution of expertise in cancer management.25 
There was however lower mortality observed in patients with 
extensive small-cell lung cancer and higher rates of curative-
intent surgery offered in early stage NSCLC when physi-
cians participated in weekly MDMs. These were clinical 
scenarios where combined modality treatment and optimal 
staging techniques are likely to provide greatest benefit.25 
The authors concluded that MDM discussions should focus 
on complex cases where there is likely to be the most benefit 
from multidisciplinary care.25
Other outcomes
Diagnosis and staging
It is crucial when lung cancer is suspected to obtain a tissue 
diagnosis to ascertain the tumor type and guide further inves-
tigation, management, and prognosis. Obtaining tissue can at 
times be a complex process and involve multiple specialties. 
Multidisciplinary care facilitates discussions between the dif-
ferent specialists involved in the diagnostic process to ensure 
that the site with the highest chance of obtaining tissue from 
is targeted first, thereby minimizing the risk to the patient of 
recurrent procedures.30 In lung cancer, access to specialist 
diagnostic investigations, including endobronchial ultrasound 
fine-needle aspiration, is important for accurate staging of 
lung cancer and delivery of appropriate treatment.21 There 
is evidence that access to the most accurate staging inves-
tigations is improved by multidisciplinary care.37,41 Indeed, 
multidisciplinary care improves the accuracy of tumor and 
nodal cancer staging, helping to limit unnecessary surgery, 
which does not appear to occur at the expense of patient 
undertreatment.37,41
Treatment
After tissue diagnosis and staging, treatment options for 
lung cancer may include surgery, chemotherapy, radiother-
apy, supportive care, or combinations of these modalities.

improving lung cancer outcomes with MDT care
Multidisciplinary care helps to bring together the specialists 
required to deliver the most appropriate evidence-based treat-
ment options for individual patients. Evidence has shown that 
MDM-based care is more likely to adhere to clinical guide-
lines and avoid variations in care.31,37,39,42 An MDM can be a 
vehicle for developing clinical governance, helping to deliver 
best-practice care and quality-improvement initiatives.43 
Furthermore, there is the potential to streamline referrals 
and resources, ensuring less duplication of investigations 
and interventions.32
Timeliness of treatment delivery is one of the key perfor-
mance indicators of quality care in lung cancer, and there are 
a number of studies demonstrating that the multidisciplinary 
model improves time between diagnosis and initiation of 
treatment.17,44 Timely treatment is considered particularly 
important in lung cancer, as tumors have rapid doubling times 
and delays in treatment may result in upstaging and worse 
outcomes for patients.
Selecting the most appropriate surgical procedure in early 
NSCLC is one of the most important steps in cancer man-
agement and vital to the individual patient’s quality of care. 
A number of studies have demonstrated that multidisciplinary 
discussion leads to the correct procedure being undertaken 
for more patients and improved clinical decision making.45,46 
Patients whose physicians attended weekly discussions at a 
tumor board were shown to be more likely to undergo curative-
intent surgery in stage I and II NSCLC.25 As the overwhelming 
majority of long-term lung cancer survivors have early stage 
disease managed surgically, this quality indicator of treatment 
is likely to translate into improved survival.
Multidisciplinary care increases access to different treat-
ment modalities in lung cancer, including surgery, chemother-
apy, and radiotherapy, and facilitates recruitment into clinical 
trials. Patients with NSCLC stage I or II disease who have not 
received surgery have been shown to be more likely to receive 
radiotherapy if they have been discussed at a tumor board.47 
Likewise, patients with stage IIIA NSCLC who were not treated 
surgically or had limited-stage small-cell lung cancer had a 
higher likelihood of optimal treatment with combined radio-
therapy and chemotherapy if discussed at an MDT.47 Limited 
single-center data have shown that involvement in a multidis-
ciplinary clinic improved enrollment in clinical trials.25,48
Patient-centered outcomes
There is some evidence that patients are more satisfied and 
have better quality of life after receiving multidisciplinary 
care rather than the traditional model of care.23,44 It is possible 
that this improved satisfaction may be due to improved access 
to palliative care services.23,49 Palliative care has a key role for 
symptom management, as well as end-of-life care, and should 
be utilized early. Indeed, a randomized controlled study of 
early utilization of palliative care services versus standard 
care showed significantly improved quality of life, mood, and 
even survival in patients with advanced NSCLC.49 Another 
study showed that improved quality of life in lung cancer has 
in itself been linked to improved survival.50
Communication and clinical decision making
There are a number of important linking steps that must occur 
in a timely fashion to ensure best-quality care in lung cancer. 
These include correct processing of initial and subsequent 
referrals to specialists and timely and patient-centered treat-
ment decisions, as well as supportive care, follow-up, and 
surveillance. Coordination of these processes is important 
for the patient’s experience, and can be particularly difficult 
if the patient is from a rural or remote area. Communication 
of decisions is crucial to ensure smooth transition across 
health services and to avoid omission of any aspect of care. 
It is thought that the multidisciplinary approach facilitates 
effective communication by ensuring that all members of the 
team are familiar with the patient’s history and have been 
involved in formulating the treatment plan. Lamb et al per-
formed a systematic review of 37 studies assessing the quality 
of care decisions emerging from MDMs, and demonstrated 
that discussion at an MDM changed management decisions 
in 2%–52% of cases.11 Furthermore, it was determined that 
the makeup of the MDT and a patient’s psychosocial situation 
affected treatment decisions from cancer MDMs, emphasiz-
ing the importance of establishing leadership, team roles, 
and responsibilities in the multidisciplinary setting.11 One 
single-center study in the US showed that multidisciplinary 
discussion changed management decisions in 43% of breast 
cancer patients, including a number of cases where the 
treatment recommendation was changed from extensive to 
localized surgery.31 These results were replicated in a more 
recent retrospective study of breast cancer patients treated 
at a single-institution multidisciplinary clinic, which found 
that changes were made in the planned surgical management 
in 52% of cases discussed at the MDM.45
Professional development
Some have argued that discussions that occur in MDMs may 
not take into consideration factors that affect clinical practice 
in the real world. The evidence suggests, however, that there

is respect among health professionals for decisions made at 
MDMs and that the recommendations are followed. One US 
study examined the outcomes of local MDMs and followed 
up patients to determine whether the recommendations of 
the MDT were implemented.51 It found that overall, 84% of 
treatment decisions made at MDMs were carried over into 
patient care.51
The medical professional’s response to the model of 
multidisciplinary care is generally positive. In one review 
of Canadian general surgeons who attended MDMs, it was 
found that greater than 90% of respondents felt that the MDM 
ensured greater consideration of all patient-treatment options, 
facilitated multidisciplinary care, and improved communica-
tion with colleagues.52 Additionally, 85% felt that the MDM 
process contributed to their professional development, and 
more than half felt that it improved patient outcomes.52 On 
the strength of the evidence presented herein, discussion at 
an MDM, despite limited data for their effectiveness, has in 
itself become a measure of quality of care.12,15,16
Barriers to success
There are multiple barriers to successful multidisciplinary 
care. These include lack of dedicated or protected time for 
clinicians to attend, financial compensation, administrative 
support, appropriate and available venue space, and difficul-
ties with communication, and record keeping.8 Adequate 
coordination of care can be difficult if the roles and respon-
sibilities of each member of the MDT are not well defined, 
there are suboptimal referral processes in place, and commu-
nication between health care professionals is not adequately 
funded.53 Additionally, in some countries, such as Australia, 
there is a particular issue in rural and regional areas, where 
caseloads may be small and there is minimal or no funding to 
run MDM-based care.28 This issue has also been highlighted 
in Canada, where one of the major barriers to a successful 
multidisciplinary approach was the paucity of specialists in 
community hospitals.27
Administrative support is crucial to the effective and 
efficient running of MDMs and the smooth coordination of 
patient care. Wright et al found that a major barrier to the 
success of MDMs in Canada was the lack of an administra-
tive coordinator. In this study, it was found that only 18% 
of community hospital MDMs and 57% of academic center 
MDMs had administrative support.52 It is clear that lack of 
administrative support means that team members have to 
take on MDM organizational roles in addition to their usual 
workload, and that this is a barrier to effective multidisci-
plinary care.52,54,55
Attendance at MDMs is a serious issue, and has been 
addressed in a number of studies.46,54 In the UK, it was 
found that making the multidisciplinary sessions protected 
clinical time improved attendance, particularly for medical 
oncologists. Although clinical practice guidelines have been 
altered to highlight the importance of providing clinicians 
with protected MDM time, few health services have to date 
implemented this recommendation.54,56,57 The issue of sup-
porting doctors to attend MDMs and remunerating them 
appropriately is an important measure to improve attendance 
at MDMs. Australia has implemented billing codes for atten-
dance at MDMs to address this issue in an effort to encourage 
participation and sustainability.9 Eligibility for these billing 
codes requires at least four medical practitioners attending the 
MDM, proper record keeping, a discussion of approximately 
10 minutes for each patient, and communication of the results 
of the MDM to the patient and primary care doctor.9
Medicolegal concerns have been identified as a possible 
issue affecting multidisciplinary care, especially when there 
is disagreement between members of the MDT.27 Many MDM 
participants are unsure of the medicolegal implications of 
participating in MDMs; in particular, they are often unaware 
that they have an individual liability for decisions made 
in an MDM.58 Sidhom and Poulsen examined physicians’ 
perceptions about medicolegal responsibilities in Australian 
MDMs, and found that although there was often a significant 
amount of disagreement about patient-treatment decisions, 
this dissent was often not verbalized.58 The participants were 
not aware that they could be held responsible for decisions 
even if they did not necessarily agree with the final MDM 
recommendation if they were present at the meeting.58
Conclusion
Overall evidence suggests that multidisciplinary care facili-
tates the delivery of a high-quality lung cancer service, and 
that this may result in improved survival, guideline-based 
treatment, and quality of life for lung cancer patients. With 
the emergence of “personalized medicine”, it is essential 
to define the standard of care in all aspects of lung cancer 
management. This extends from the process of obtaining a 
tissue diagnosis to staging and implementation of evidence-
based treatment. An important component of best-quality 
lung cancer care is offering a service that provides equitable 
and timely access to diagnostic procedures and treatments, 
including emerging molecular therapies and enrollment in 
clinical trials.
While multidisciplinary care has emerged as the stan-
dard of care for lung cancer management, there remains a

improving lung cancer outcomes with MDT care
relative lack of data to justify the expense and time required 
to deliver this model of care. This review has outlined the 
available evidence that multidisciplinary care improves qual-
ity of life and survival, facilitates more accurate staging and 
appropriate treatment decisions, reduces ineffective surgical 
interventions, and increases assess to surgery, radiotherapy, 
and palliative care services. Additionally, physicians appear 
to be satisfied with the process, and feel that it provides the 
best-quality care for patients. Future research should focus 
on defining barriers to successful multidisciplinary care, 
including the role of clinical leadership and communication 
in facilitating care, and identifying existing administrative, 
logistic, time, and economic constraints on MDTs.
Ideally, MDMs function to help reduce variations in lung 
cancer care, particularly for complex patients who require 
multimodality treatment and for those from disadvantaged 
backgrounds or from rural and remote areas who may not 
have equality of access to cancer services. It is hoped that 
multidisciplinary care will overcome ageist and nihilistic 
attitudes to lung cancer and provide a standard of care that 
helps to improve outcomes, particularly survival. With the 
aging population and widespread introduction of lung cancer 
screening, in future MDMs will need to provide patient-
centered and economically responsible clinical decision 
making in the setting of increased demand on health ser-
vices. It is hoped that multidisciplinary care will fulfill these 
expectations and be a key player in improving outcomes in 
lung cancer, but there is work to be done in developing and 
refining the multidisciplinary care process.
More quality evidence is needed to confirm the asso-
ciation between multidisciplinary care and improvement 
in important lung cancer outcomes that so far have been 
demonstrated by limited observational data.
