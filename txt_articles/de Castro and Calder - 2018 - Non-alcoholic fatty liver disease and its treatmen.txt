Abstract 
38 
Background and aims: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common liver diseases 
39 
in Western countries. Metabolic disorders which are increasing in prevalence, such as dyslipidaemias, 
40 
obesity and type 2 diabetes, are closely related to NAFLD. Insulin resistance is a prominent risk factor 
41 
for NAFLD. Marine omega-3 (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are able to decrease plasma 
42 
triacylglycerol and diets rich in marine n-3 PUFAs are associated with a lower cardiovascular risk. 
43 
Furthermore, marine n-3 PUFAs are precursors of pro-resolving and anti-inflammatory mediators. 
44 
They can modulate lipid metabolism by enhancing fatty acid β-oxidation and decreasing de novo 
45 
lipogenesis. Therefore, they may play an important role in prevention and therapy of NAFLD. 
46 
Methods: This review aims to gather the currently information about marine n-3 PUFAs as a 
47 
therapeutic approach in NAFLD. Actions of marine n-3 PUFAs on hepatic fat metabolism are 
48 
reported, as well as studies addressing the effects of marine n-3 PUFAs in human subjects with 
49 
NAFLD. Results: A total seventeen published human studies investigating the effects of n-3 PUFAs 
50 
on markers of NAFLD were found and twelve of these reported a decrease in liver fat and/or other 
51 
markers of NAFLD after supplementation with n-3 PUFAs. The failure of n-3 PUFAs to decrease 
52 
markers of NAFLD in five studies may be due to short duration, poor compliance, patient specific 
53 
factors and the sensitivity of the methods used. Conclusions: Marine n-3 PUFAs are likely to be an 
54 
important tool for NAFLD treatment, although further studies are required to confirm this.

Backgrounds and Aims  
75 
 
76 
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is defined as a condition in which liver 
77 
triacylglycerol (TAG) concentration surpasses 5% of wet liver weight in patients without excessive 
78 
alcohol intake (i.e., alcohol abuse characterized by a consumption of more than 10 g of ethanol per 
79 
day). NAFLD occurs as the result of an imbalance of hepatic TAG synthesis and export [1, 2]. Liver 
80 
biopsy is considered the gold-standard diagnostic tool, although its use is limited by risk of morbidity 
81 
and mortality,  sampling error and cost. As hepatic biopsy is not always possible, the definition of 
82 
NAFLD also involves evidence of hepatic fat accumulation verified by imaging for example by 
83 
ultrasonography or magnetic resonance spectroscopy [3]. 
84 
The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases proposed a NAFLD classification 
85 
correlating histological characteristics with long-term prognosis: simple steatosis (class 1); steatosis 
86 
with lobular inflammation (class 2); presence of ballooned hepatocytes (class 3); presence of either 
87 
Mallory’s hyaline or fibrosis (class 4) [2]. Classes 3 and 4 are described as non-alcoholic 
88 
steatohepatitis (NASH)  [2]. Another score was suggested by the NASH Clinical Research Network. 
89 
This is the NAFLD activity score (NAS)  wich is characterized by the weighted sum of steatosis (0 to 
90 
3), lobular inflammation (0 to 3), and hepatocyte ballooning (0 to 2). The NAS ranges from 0 to 8. A 
91 
NAS < 3 corresponds to “not NASH”; 3 to 4 is classified as “borderline NASH”; and > 5 means a 
92 
“definitive NASH” diagnosis [4]. The most common NAFLD presentation is asymptomatic with 
93 
elevation of serum transaminases, particularly alanine aminotransferase (ALT) higher than aspartate 
94 
aminotransferase (AST) [5]. 
95 
The classical theory of NAFLD progression comprises lipid accumulation as the first “hit” 
96 
and an increase in inflammation and the second “hit” as an increase in oxidative stress and lipid 
97 
peroxidation [6]. The first hit is associated with insulin resistance and increases susceptibility to the 
98 
second hit, which results in NAFLD progression to NASH (Figure 1). In one cohort study NAFLD 
99 
progressed to NASH in 47% of subjects and from NASH to more severe hepatic diseases in 25-50% 
100 
of these subjects (i.e. in 12 to 24% of all subjects) [7]. The early stages of the disease can be reversed 
101 
(Figure 1). The progression to cirrhosis is related to a poor prognosis and, in one study, of the subjects 
102 
who progressed to that stage, 50% required liver transplantation, 7% developed hepatocellular 
103 
carcinoma, and 20% died [8].  
104 
Type-2 diabetes has a strong association with NAFLD [9]. Hepatic inflammation and  in 
105 
adipose tissue and alterations in fat metabolism seem to have a causal relation to insulin resistance, 
106 
dyslipidaemia and cardiovascular risk [10]. Some single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been 
107 
shown to be related to NAFLD severity and NASH, such as SNPs in the gene encoding patatin-like 
108 
phospholipase domain–containing 3 (PNPLA3) [11].  
109 
Lifestyle modifications are the first treatment option for NAFLD and body weight loss is the 
110 
most important goal for the majority of patients with NAFLD [12]. However dietary modification 
111 
 4 
 
may have a significant role in NAFLD treatment independent of weight loss [5]. Bariatric surgery also 
112 
seems to be highly effective in treating NAFLD; a systematic review showed an improvement in 
113 
steatosis in 91% of subjects who underwent bariatric surgery [13]. Marine omega-3 (n-3) 
114 
polyunsatured fatty acids (PUFAs) decrease plasma TAG concentrations, regulate hepatic fatty acid 
115 
and TAG metabolism and have anti-inflammatory properties [14]. These properties may be useful in 
116 
treatment of NAFLD [15].  
117 
 
118 
Methods 
119 
 
120 
Considering both the increasing importance of NAFLD and the metabolic effects of marine n-
121 
3 PUFAs, this review will describe the processes underlying NAFLD, the relevant properties of 
122 
marine n-3 PUFAs, and the studies in which marine n-3 PUFAs have been used to treat NAFLD.  
123 
This is a narrative review in which studies showing metabolic pathways and mechanism of action of 
124 
marine omega-3 were included.  Clinical trials addressing the effects of omega-3 on hepatic fat were 
125 
obtained from PubMed and SciELO websites. The search terms were: NAFLD, NASH, non- alcoholic 
126 
fatty liver disease, non- alcoholic steatohepatitis, steatosis, liver fat, hepatic fat, fatty liver, omega-3 
127 
fatty acids, DHA, EPA, docosahexaenoic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, fish oil, algal oil.

Risk factors and NAFLD prevalence  
132 
NAFLD and NASH reported prevalence is influenced by the method used to diagnose and the 
133 
population studied. In Western populations, the prevalence of NAFLD  is estimated to be between 15 
134 
and 30% [16, 17], but this may be an underestimate [18]. In Germany, 4160 subjects were included in 
135 
a population-based cohort study. They were evaluated by ultrasonography and 30.4% were diagnosed 
136 
with NAFLD [19]. A study from Scotland reported a NAFLD prevalence of 46.2% in subjects with 
137 
type-2 diabetes [20]. Hepatic histology in 498 post-mortem livers showed a prevalence of NAFLD of 
138 
31% in Greece [21]. In Romania, 3005 hospitalized patients were evaluated by ultrasonography and 
139 
20% of them were identified to have NAFLD [22]. A study in Sudan reported a NAFLD prevalence 
140 
of 20% in 100 asymptomatic subjects [23]. In Korea, a study of potential liver donors found a 
141 
NAFLD prevalence of 51% [24]. Subjects with NAFLD were characterized in Brazil and 45% were 
142 
overweight, 44% had type-2 diabetes and 41% had metabolic syndrome [25].  
143 
The Dallas Heart Study found a higher prevalence of hepatic steatosis in Hispanic subjects 
144 
than in Caucasians who in turn had higher prevalence than African-Americans [26]. Another study 
145 
aimed to understand this lower prevalence of NAFLD in African-Americans in a population-based 
146 
study that estimated NAFLD and NASH prevalence in 2170 subjects by dual-energy x-ray 
147 
 5 
 
absorptiometry. Lower intraperitoneal fat accumulation was found in African-American subjects and 
148 
this was associated with a protection from NAFLD, although no differences were found in insulin 
149 
resistance between Hispanic and African-American subjects [27].  The I148M allele of the PNPLA3 
150 
gene is a genetic contributor to NAFLD and this allele is most prevalent in Hispanics, Caucasians 
151 
came after and then African-Americans [28, 29]. Conversely, the PNPLA3 rs6006460[T] allele was 
152 
common in African-Americans and was associated with lower hepatic fat [29]. Thus, Hispanics may 
153 
have a genetic predisposition to fatty liver, while African Americans may have a genetic protection 
154 
against it. 
155 
The Third National Health and Nutrition Examination (NHANES III, 1988-1994) in the US 
156 
estimated NAFLD prevalence in non-institutionalized healthy subjects by using ultrasonography. 
157 
Hepatic steatosis was found in 21% of subjects and among these 90% were considered to have 
158 
NAFLD (19% of the study population). A higher prevalence was found in Mexican Americans 
159 
compared to non-Hispanic whites and African Americans and among men compared to women [30]. 
160 
The differences in prevalence among ethnic groups are consistent with the studies described earlier. 
161 
The sex influence on NAFLD is not fully understood. However, male sex is related to higher presence 
162 
of NASH and fibrosis and greater risk of mortality in subjects with NAFLD [18, 31].  
163 
NAFLD is strongly associated with obesity. A study in obese subjects (defined by a body 
164 
mass index > 35 kg/m2) who had liver biopsies whilst undergoing bariatric surgery reported 96% 
165 
prevalence of NAFLD; of these 26 subjects had NASH (25% of the study population) [32]. This 
166 
research also confirmed the association of central body fat distribution, abnormal glucose metabolism 
167 
and hypertension with NASH [32]. Type-2 diabetes is also one of the most important risk factors for 
168 
NAFLD. In people with type-2 diabetes, the estimated prevalence of NAFLD in hospital-based 
169 
studies is 45% to 75% and 30% to 70% in population-based studies [33] and in obese people with 
170 
type-2 diabetes it can reach 56% [34]. In view of this, it is suggested that serum ALT and AST should 
171 
be investigated in all people with type-2 diabetes [7]. 
172 
A prospective study evaluated the prevalence of NAFLD and NASH in 328 subjects by 
173 
ultrasonography and in 134 biopsies for those subjects diagnosed with NAFLD. The prevalence of 
174 
NAFLD was 46% and Hispanic subjects had the highest prevalence (58%), shadowed by Caucasians 
175 
(44%) and African-Americans (35%) [35]. Another study evaluated the prevalence of insulin 
176 
resistance in young, lean, healthy and sedentary subjects of different ethnicities. Asian-Indian men 
177 
showed higher prevalence of insulin resistance compared to Eastern-Asians, Caucasians, African 
178 
Americans and Hispanics [36]. Furthermore, Asian-Indians had an increase in hepatic TAG content 
179 
and plasma interleukin (IL)-6 concentration compared to Caucasians suggesting that Asian-Indian 
180 
men could be predisposed to develop insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis even with a normal body 
181 
mass index [36]. Consistent with this, a NAFLD prevalence of 8.7% was found in a rural, 
182 
predominantly lean, Indian population, suggesting an important role for risk factors other than obesity 
183 
[37]. Age is positively associated to NAFLD and its progression (fibrosis and cirrhosis) [38]. 
184 
 6 
 
However this association may be linked to the duration of the disease and also older subjects have 
185 
more risk factors for NAFLD, such as obesity, type-2 diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidaemia. 
186 
Furthermore, advanced age increases the risk of complications such as severe fibrosis and 
187 
hepatocellular carcinoma [18]. 
188 
Dietary intake has been characterised in some studies of subjects with NAFLD [39-42].  
189 
These studies identified a diet distinguished by high intakes of simple carbohydrates, saturated fat and 
190 
protein from meat and low intakes of marine n-3 PUFAs and micronutrients [39, 40, 43]. A cross-
191 
sectional study of a sub-sample of 375 subjects in Israel reported that a high consumption of simple 
192 
carbohydrates (sugars) from soft drinks and of proteins from all types of meat were a risk factor for 
193 
developing NAFLD and that a high consumption of fish with high concentration of marine n-3 
194 
PUFAs had a protective effect [40]. Also, a higher intake of omega-6 (n-6) fatty acids and a higher 
195 
dietary n-6/n-3 fatty acid ratio were reported for NAFLD subjects [43].  
196 
 
197 
Marine n-3 PUFAs - sources and intakes 
198 
 
199 
 
N-3 PUFA definition and classification 
200 
 
201 
 
N-3 PUFAs have a double bond between carbon 3 and 4 of the hydrocarbon (acyl) chain 
202 
counting from the methyl end [14]. There are several members of the n-3 fatty acid family, varying in 
203 
carbon chain length and amount of double bonds. The very long chain highly unsaturated n-3 PUFAs, 
204 
eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20:5n-3), docosapentaenoic acid (DPA; 22:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic 
205 
acid (DHA; 22:6n-3) are functionally the most important members of the n-3 fatty acid family [14]. 
206 
EPA, DPA and DHA are found in a variety of foods, but the richest source is seafood, particularly 
207 
fatty fish, such as mackerel, pilchards, sardines, salmon, trout, tuna and herring (Table 1). Hence, here 
208 
we refer to EPA, DPA and DHA as marine n-3 PUFAs. Lean fish such as cod, haddock and plaice and 
209 
crustaceans and shellfish also contain marine n-3 PUFAs, as do fish oil supplements, cod liver oil, 
210 
algal oils, krill oil and pharmaceutical grade preparations. Some of the sources of marine n-3 PUFAs 
211 
and the amount per adult portion size are listed in the Table 1 according to the British Nutrition 
212 
Foundation food composition data [44]. Eggs and meat have modest amounts of EPA, DPA and DHA 
213 
[14].  
214 
 
215 
**Table 1** 
216 
 
217 
N-3 PUFA elongation and desaturation 
218 
Alpha-linolenic acid (ALA; 18:3n-3) is the precursor of the long chain n-3 PUFAs. It is an 
219 
essential fatty acid since it cannot be synthesized in animals including humans [45]. Likewise, linoleic 
220 
acid (18:2n-6) is an essential n-6 fatty acid. Both ALA and linoleic acid must be acquired from diet. 
221 
 7 
 
They are both synthesized in plants and consequently are found in seeds, nuts, and seed oils. There is 
222 
a pathway for conversion of ALA to EPA and on to DPA and DHA [14]. However, this conversion, 
223 
especially to the end product DHA, is poor [46] and is known to be lower in men than women [47]. 
224 
This process of ALA conversion to EPA involves desaturation, elongation and another desaturation 
225 
using delta-6 desaturase, elongase, and delta-5 desaturase, respectively [14]. These same enzymes are 
226 
also responsible for the analogous conversions in the n-6 fatty acid family from linoleic acid to 
227 
arachidonic acid (20:4n-6). Despite the greater affinity of delta-6 desaturase for ALA than linoleic 
228 
acid, the n-6 family shows higher conversion rates due to higher amount of linoleic acid in cellular 
229 
pools [46]. Therefore, the higher intake of n-6 fatty acids in Western diets seems to result in a low 
230 
conversion of ALA to bioactive long chain n-3 PUFAs.  DPA is formed by elongation of EPA while 
231 
DHA is formed from DPA by a complex pathway involving several enzymes [46]. Figure 2 illustrates 
232 
the metabolism of essential fatty acids.   
233 
N-3 PUFA intake 
234 
The consumption of marine n-3 PUFAs is difficult to determine, partly because of the 
235 
bimodal pattern of fatty fish consumption, the infrequent consumption of fish, poor dietary assessment 
236 
tools and inadequate food composition tables.  Furthermore, the exact marine n-3 fatty acid content of 
237 
fish is uncertain and variable due to several factors including season, diet, water temperature, stage in 
238 
the life cycle, and whether wild or farmed [14, 48]. Intakes of marine n-3 PUFAs among adults who 
239 
do not consume fatty fish are thought to be in the tens to low hundreds of mg per day [14]. Clearly, 
240 
such intakes can be greatly increased by eating seafood especially fatty fish or by use of supplements 
241 
[14]. By comparison, adult intakes of ALA are typically 0.5 to 2 g/d [14]. It is useful to compare these 
242 
intakes to those that are recommended by different authorities. The European Food Safety Authority 
243 
(EFSA) indicates an adequate intake (AI) for ALA as 0.5% of total energy for all population groups 
244 
[49]. In adults, consuming a 2000 cal/day diet this would equate to about 1 g ALA/day. EFSA 
245 
recommends that adults should consume 0.25 g of EPA + DHA daily with an additional 0.1-0.2 g of 
246 
DHA daily for pregnant and lactating women [49]. The American Heart Association made different 
247 
recommendations for healthy people (EPA+DHA 0.5 g/d), for people with coronary artery diseases 
248 
(EPA+DHA, 1 g/d) and for hypertriglyceridemic subjects (EPA + DHA 3-4 g/d) [50]. FAO/WHO 
249 
recommended an intake of 0.5-2% of energy as ALA + EPA + DHA and 0.25 g to 2 g per day of EPA 
250 
+ DHA for adults [49, 51]. The precise requirement for marine n-3 PUFAs is not known 
251 
 
252 
Fatty acid metabolism and its regulation: sites of action of marine n-3 PUFAs 
253 
 
254 
Dietary lipids digestion and absorption occur mainly in the small intestine through the 
255 
combined action of bile acid emulsification and pancreatic lipase catalysed hydrolysis. The products 
256 
of TAG digestion (monoacylglycerols and free fatty acids) are taken up into enterocytes where they 
257 
are used for resynthesis of TAGs which are secreted as components of nascent chylomicrons into the 
258 
 8 
 
lymphatic system. Soon after food consumption, the chylomicrons reach the bloodstream. Here, 
259 
interactions with other lipoproteins result in apolipoprotein (apo) exchange:  apoA-I and apoA-IV are 
260 
replaced by apoE and apoC-II. These changes aid the vascular metabolism of the chylomicrons. For 
261 
example, in adipose tissue apoC-II activates lipoprotein lipase which hydrolyses chylomicron TAGs 
262 
making the component fatty acids available to adipocytes. As a consequence fatty acids are then 
263 
stored in adipose tissue as TAGs and the TAG-poor chylomicron remnants remain in the circulation to 
264 
be cleared by hepatocytes via recognition of apoE by hepatic LDL receptors. Hepatocytes can reuse 
265 
the components of the uptaken chylomicron remnants (e.g. cholesterol, fatty acids) to resynthesize 
266 
TAGs and other components of very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) which are subsequently 
267 
released into the bloodstream [52, 53]. Marine n-3 PUFAs have been reported to lower the 
268 
concentration of chylomicrons and TAGs after an oral fat tolerance test [54]. Furthermore, circulating 
269 
apoB-48 and apoB-100 concentrations were reduced by EPA and DHA compared to safflower oil [54]. 
270 
In the fed state, EPA and DHA increased LPL activity and accelerated chylomicron TAG clearance 
271 
[54]. 
272 
Several transcription factors are related to the control of hepatic lipid metabolism and Table 2 
273 
lists the potential effects of n-3 PUFAs on these factors. Liver X receptor (LXR) is activated by 
274 
oxysterols, which are cholesterol metabolites. LXR controls reverse cholesterol transport through 
275 
expression of ATP-binding cassette transporters A1 and G1, promotes de novo fatty acid synthesis by 
276 
increasing expression of the transcription factors sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP)-
277 
1c and carbohydrate response element binding protein (ChREBP),  and promotes glycolysis via the 
278 
phosphofructokinase (PFK)-2/fructose-bisphosphatase-2 system [53]. PUFAs are able to regulate 
279 
SREBP and ChREBP and therefore the genes controlled by these transcription factors [55], many of 
280 
which encode enzymes involved in fatty acid and TAG synthesis and lipoprotein assembly. In vitro, 
281 
EPA and DHA decreased the expression of several genes related to de novo fatty acid synthesis, 
282 
including SREBP-1c itself, and DHA also prevented LXRα activation [56]. In obese (ob/ob) mice 
283 
marine n-3 PUFAs ameliorated hepatic steatosis by suppressing SREBP-1 expression [57]. Farnesoid 
284 
X receptor (FXR) is a transcription factor greatly expressed in the liver, intestine, kidneys and adrenal 
285 
cortex. It has a central part in bile acid metabolism downregulating synthesis, secretion and 
286 
reabsorption. FXR is also able to decrease cholesterol and TAG synthesis through down regulation of 
287 
SREBP-1c, SREBP-2 and LXR [58]. Linoleic acid, arachidonic acid and DHA have been shown to be 
288 
FXR ligands while stearic and palmitic acids had no FXR binding activity [59]. Hepatocyte nuclear 
289 
factor 4 (HNF-4α) is another nuclear receptor modulated by fatty acids [60]. It is expressed in liver, 
290 
kidneys, intestine and pancreas [60] and regulated several genes related to lipoprotein, iron, and 
291 
carbohydrate metabolism, cytochrome P450 monooxygenases and bile acid synthesis [61]. The length 
292 
of fatty acid chain and degree of saturation seem to influence its transcription: saturated fatty acids 
293 
increase the transcription of HNF-4α, while PUFAs have the opposite effect [61]. Rat hepatocytes 
294 
cultured with fish oil rich chylomicron remnant-like particles showed a decrease in HNF-4α mRNA 
295 
 9 
 
and protein and a reduced expression of genes encoding apo B and microsomal transfer protein, which 
296 
are regulated by HNF-4α [62]. 
297 
SREBP-1a, -1c and -2 are key lipogenic transcription factors. SREBP-1c and SREBP-2 are 
298 
highly expressed in the liver. The SREBP-1c increases expression of genes connected with fatty acid 
299 
and TAG synthesis while SREBP-2 activates genes for enzymes involved in synthesis of  cholesterol 
300 
[53].  Fish oil decreases SREBP-1 gene expression [63, 64], although the mechanism by which this 
301 
occurs is not fully elucidated. Plasma and intracellular membrane enrichment with PUFAs leads to 
302 
cholesterol migration from highly concentrated areas, such as the plasma membrane, to less 
303 
concentrated membranes, such as endoplasmic reticulum membrane, which impairs SREBP migration 
304 
from the endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi complex [65]. Furthermore, PUFAs increase the hydrolysis 
305 
of membrane sphingomyelin to ceramide and phosphocholine, which decreases the membrane 
306 
sphingomyelin content and consequently impairs free cholesterol solubilisation and increases 
307 
intracellular cholesterol concentration, inhibiting SREBP-2 [65].  
308 
ChREBP increases the expression of L-pyruvate kinase (L-PK), a glycolytic enzyme, and the 
309 
expression of lipogenic genes, as malic enzyme, ATP-citrate lyase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, fatty acid 
310 
synthase, stearoyl-CoA desaturase and fatty acid elongases [53]. Glucose absorbed by hepatocytes 
311 
after a meal enters the glycogenic pathway. However, when the liver is replete with glycogen, glucose 
312 
is diverted to fatty acid synthesis. Glucokinase (GCK), PFK, L-PK, and pyruvate dehydrogenase 
313 
(PDH) kinases control glycolytic flux. Pyruvate, the main product of glycolysis, provides carbon for 
314 
de novo fatty acid synthesis via acetyl-CoA. ChERBP expression is stimulated by glucose and this 
315 
transcription factor activates hepatic L-PK gene expression.  L-PK is the enzyme responsible for 
316 
converting phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate. Pyruvate is metabolized by PDH to generate acetyl-
317 
CoA, which is combined with oxaloacetate to form citrate. ATP-citrate lyase splits the citrate 
318 
exported to cytoplasm back into acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate. Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) 
319 
coverts acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA in the cytoplasm. Fatty acid synthase (FAS) consumes malonyl-
320 
CoA as the carbon donor to generate palmitic acid [53]. Furthermore, FAS might be linked to the 
321 
synthesis of an endogenous peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR)-α ligand, 1-palmitoyl-
322 
2-oleoly-sn-glycerol-3-phosphocholine, indicating a contra-regulation of de novo synthesis of fatty 
323 
acids to stimulate β-oxidation [66]. Dentin and colleagues demonstrated effects of PUFAs on 
324 
ChREBP in vivo and in vitro. Linoleic acid, EPA and DHA were able to downregulate ChREBP gene 
325 
expression through accelerating ChREBP mRNA decay [67]. FAS was also downregulated and 
326 
demonstrated to be controlled by ChREBP and by SREBP. L-PK is not under SREBP regulation, but 
327 
was decreased by ChREBP inhibition [67].  
328 
Lipolysis in adipocytes generates non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs), which enter the 
329 
bloodstream and can be taken up by hepatocytes and enter the hepatic fatty acid pool. Adipocyte TAG 
330 
is hydrolysed by adipose tissue TAG lipase to release a NEFA and diacylglycerol (DAG), which is 
331 
hydrolysed by hormone-sensitive lipase to another NEFA and monoacylglycerol. Monoacylglycerol 
332 
 10 
 
lipase generates a third NEFA and glycerol [53]. These processes are promoted by stress hormones 
333 
like adrenaline as a means of providing NEFAs as an energy source in times of need. Further, insulin 
334 
inhibits lipolysis in adipose tissue, so that in insulin resistant states the flux of NEFAs from 
335 
adipocytes is increased [52] resulting in elevated concentrations of NEFAs in the plasma [52]. 
336 
Hepatocytes take up NEFAs from the bloodstream mostly by CD36, fatty acid transport protein 
337 
(FATP) 2, FATP4 and FATP5 [53]. 
338 
Upon entering the cell fatty acids are converted into acyl-CoA in the cytosol by acyl-CoA 
339 
synthetase. Short and medium chain acyl-CoAs can cross membranes and enter organelles like 
340 
mitochondria where they are readily oxidised [52]. Carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT-1) is an 
341 
enzyme that enables long chain fatty acid translocation to the mitochondrial matrix for β-oxidation. 
342 
CPT-1 represents the rate-limiting step of β-oxidation and its activity is downregulated by malonyl-
343 
CoA [53]. Hence, when malonyl-CoA concentrations are elevated fatty acid -oxidation is inhibited 
344 
and fatty acid synthesis is promoted. However, in insulin resistant states NEFA supply to the liver can 
345 
exceed demand and the fatty acids are incorporated into TAG. This provides a direct causal link 
346 
between insulin resistance, elevated blood NEFAs, hepatic TAG synthesis and NAFLD. 
347 
Mitochondrial -oxidation generates energy from short, medium and long chain fatty acids. The 
348 
product of -oxidation is acetyl-CoA which feeds to the tricarboxylic acid cycle or is converted to 
349 
ketones bodies [52]. The electron transport chain generates ATP as a result of fatty acid oxidation. 
350 
There is a certain level of inefficiency in the electron transfer chain and in other oxidation reactions, 
351 
such that reactive oxygen species are generated and lipid peroxidation occurs [52].  Gene expression 
352 
of enzymes of hepatic fatty acid oxidation is regulated by the transcription factor PPAR-α, which 
353 
ultimately promotes both mitochondrial and peroxisomal β-oxidation [68]. Marine n-3 PUFAs can 
354 
upregulate and activate hepatic PPAR-α [69], meaning that they act to partition fatty acids in the 
355 
direction of -oxidation and far from TAG synthesis. 
356

Insulin resistance  
360 
 
361 
As indicated above, the increase in hepatic TAG accumulation can be subsequent to increased 
362 
lipolysis in adipose tissue, leading to increase in serum NEFA concentrations which are taken up by 
363 
hepatocytes driving TAG synthesis [70]. An estimate of hepatic TAG origin in patients with NAFLD 
364 
demonstrated a dominance of preformed NEFAs as the main source (59%), followed by de novo 
365 
lipogenesis (in the fasting state 26% of hepatic TAG and 23% of VLDL TAG were resultant from de 
366 
novo lipogenesis) [71]. It is remarkable that de novo lipogenesis made such a contribution to TAG 
367 
synthesis in patients with NAFLD in the fasting state and that this did not increase in the postprandial 
368 
 11 
 
period after a meal with 30% of fat [71]. This suggests that these patients had reached a threshold for 
369 
de novo fatty acid synthesis. Also, the turnover of hepatic TAG was lower in NAFLD patients (20 to 
370 
60 days compared to 1-2 days in healthy subjects) and the percentage of hepatic TAG derived from 
371 
the diet was 15% [71].   
372 
As defined by Angulo, from NAFLD to NASH, liver histology shows steatosis, inflammatory 
373 
cell infiltration, hepatocyte ballooning and necrosis, glycogen nuclei, Mallory bodies, and fibrosis 
374 
[72]. NAFLD and NASH are classically characterized by the increased amount of hepatic TAG [73]. 
375 
Nevertheless, these patients also present a lower hepatic content of EPA and DHA [73]. The majority 
376 
of NAFLD is associated with obesity, which involves adipose tissue inflammation [74]. When more 
377 
than normal insulin concentrations are required to generate a given metabolic response and/or when 
378 
normal insulin concentrations are not enough for these responses the condition is called insulin 
379 
resistance [75]. Individuals with NASH proved by liver biopsy presented an increased pancreatic 
380 
insulin secretion, severe insulin resistance and similar hepatic insulin removal from the bloodstream 
381 
compared to healthy subjects [76].  Figure 3 summarises the main metabolic alterations due to insulin 
382 
resistance and their effect on NAFLD development. 
383 
The liver produces glucose during the fasting state via gluconeogenesis or glycogenolysis and 
384 
this production is supressed by insulin in the postprandial state so long as the liver is insulin sensitive. 
385 
Insulin inhibits glucose-6 phosphatase, which converts glucose-6-phosphate into glucose, and 
386 
phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, responsible for phosphoenolpyruvate formation. Thus in the 
387 
insulin sensitive state, insulin suppresses hepatic glucose output. Hepatic insulin resistance means the 
388 
loss of the ability to block hepatic glucose production and output during the postprandial period. 
389 
The loss of insulin-mediated glucose uptake into skeletal muscle and skeletal muscle 
390 
glycogen synthesis, both of which are insulin sensitive processes, means reduced demand for glucose 
391 
and the sparing of glucose for hepatic de novo lipogenesis. Enlarged de novo lipogenesis in the liver 
392 
seems to come ahead of adipose tissue insulin resistance and the higher flux of NEFAs to the liver 
393 
[77]. Hepatic TAG accumulation does not itself seem to be toxic. Fatty liver is not always 
394 
accompanied by insulin resistance and despite all of the information available, it is not yet known 
395 
which comes first, insulin resistance or fatty liver [78]. Subjects with NAFLD and NASH show an 
396 
increase in hepatic DAG and increased TAG to DAG and n-6 to n-3 fatty acid ratios [73]. DAG and 
397 
TAG accumulation in the liver can be due to multiple causes as pointed out by Jornayvaz and 
398 
Schulman: increased delivery of chylomicron remnants, increased release of NEFAs from adipose 
399 
tissue, postprandial hyperinsulinemia raising hepatic de novo lipogenesis, and lower β-oxidation due 
400 
to decreased mitochondrial function [79]. NAFLD patients also showed a decrease in hepatic 
401 
phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine [73] while NAFLD and NASH patients had an 
402 
increase in hepatic free cholesterol and total n-6 fatty acids compared to control individuals [73]. The 
403 
fatty acid profile of hepatic lipid fractions in subjects with NASH showed a lower than normal content 
404 
of n-6 and n-3 PUFAs in TAG, a lower than normal amount of arachidonic acid in DAG and PC, an 
405 
 12 
 
increased n-6 to n-3 fatty acid ratio in TAG and in the free fatty acid pool, and a lower than normal 
406 
hepatic content of long chain fatty acids [73].  
407 
In mice, a high amount of DAG in hepatocytes seems to be more toxic than high TAG [80]. 
408 
Inhibition of DAG acyltransferase 2 (DGAT2) in a mouse model of NAFLD decreased hepatic TAG 
409 
but increased oxidative stress, NEFAs, lobular inflammation and fibrosis [80]. Also, hepatic DAG 
410 
content could be related to hepatic insulin resistance [79]. Protein kinase Cε (PKC) has high affinity 
411 
for DAG and its activation is implicated in hepatic insulin resistance [79]. 
412 
Obese individuals undergoing bariatric surgery showed a strong positive association between 
413 
hepatic DAG amount and a measure of insulin resistance [81]. This correlation was stronger between 
414 
DAG in lipid droplets compared to membrane DAG. PKCε was the most abundant PKC isoform 
415 
found in liver and was strongly associated with the DAG content in hepatic lipid droplets [81]. 
416 
Among the DAG, the ones composed of C18:1-C16:0, C18:1-C18:1, C18:1-C18-2 and C16:0-C18:2 
417 
had higher concentration and positive association with insulin resistance. The C20:4-C20:5 DAG was 
418 
inversely associated with insulin resistance [81].  Endothelial cells incubated with DHA showed a 
419 
decrease in PKCε activation, cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 mRNA expression, COX-2 protein expression 
420 
and prostaglandin production [82]. DHA was able to attenuate nuclear factor κ B (NFκB) activation 
421 
[82]. PKCε and PKCθ were related to insulin resistance in liver and muscle, respectively [83, 84]. 
422 
Furthermore, PKCε knockout mice were protected from insulin resistance caused by a high fat diet, 
423 
despite having increased hepatic fat [85].  
424 
Ceramides are sphingolipid-derived constituents of cell membranes. They are generated by 
425 
three different pathways: de novo synthesis, sphingomyelinase pathway, or salvage pathway [86]. De 
426 
novo synthesis of ceramides from palmitoyl-CoA is regulated by cellular redox status and increases in 
427 
oxidative stress can raise ceramide synthesis [86, 87]. Hepatic ceramide synthesis was increased in 
428 
obese and insulin resistant individuals and all ceramide species were positively associated with 
429 
plasma tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α [88]. Also, a decrease in adiponectin concentration seems to be 
430 
related to the increase in hepatic ceramide content due to the inhibitory effects of adiponectin on 
431 
ceramide synthesis [86]. Furthermore, when myoricin, a ceramide synthesis inhibitor, was given to 
432 
ob/ob mice fed a high fat diet there was a decrease in body weight, hepatic steatosis and inflammation 
433 
and improved insulin sensitivity showing a potential role for inhibition of ceramide synthesis in the 
434 
treatment of obesity comorbities [89]. Although no clear association between ceramides and human 
435 
NAFLD has been established, increased hepatic ceramides seem to be one of several alterations 
436 
generated by insulin resistance and ceramides act as lipid mediators increasing cytokine expression, 
437 
mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and lipoprotein aggregation [86].  
438 
Obese women with fatty liver showed increased expression in subcutaneous adipose tissue of 
439 
macrophage markers (CD38, monocyte chemoattractant peptide 1 and CCL3) and plasminogen 
440 
activator inhibitor 1, decreased expression of PPAR-γ and adiponectin, and increased amounts of 
441 
ceramides, sphingomyelins, ether phospholipids and TAG compared to obese women without fatty 
442 
 13 
 
liver [74].  The amount of ceramides, C16:0-ceramide and DAG in subcutaneous adipose tissue 
443 
showed a positive association with insulin resistance [90]. In this study, the total amount of ceramides 
444 
in adipose tissue was higher in obese type-2 diabetic and obese non-diabetic subjects compared to 
445 
lean non-diabetic subjects [90].  
446 
Cholesterol metabolism revealed an association with NAFLD progression and NASH in 
447 
obese subjects submitted to gastric bypass. Serum VLDL and LDL cholesterol concentrations were 
448 
positively correlated to hepatic inflammation and fibrosis. Also serum VLDL cholesterol was 
449 
associated to hepatic cholesterol content [91]. Although no clear link between liver TAG and 
450 
cholesterol synthesis has been demonstrated, Caballero and colleagues reported that NAFLD patients 
451 
had an enhanced expression of SREBP-2, which regulates cholesterol synthesis, and steroidogenic 
452 
acute regulatory transfer protein, a polypeptide related in mitochondrial cholesterol transport [92]. 
453 
Genetically modified obese mice fed a high fat diet developed hyperinsulinemia, diabetes, 
454 
hypercholesterolemia, and hypoadiponectinemia. In this animal model, hyperinsulinemia induced 
455 
SREBP-2 expression, which up-regulated LDL receptor, decreased bile acid synthesis and cholesterol 
456 
and bile acid secretion resulting in accumulation of hepatic cholesterol [93]. 
457 
The amount of liver free cholesterol increased gradually from individuals with normal hepatic 
458 
histology to NAFLD and NASH [73]. The increase in hepatic fat leads to increased cholesterol 
459 
synthesis. NAFLD patients seem to have lower rates of cholesterol absorption and higher rates of 
460 
cholesterol synthesis compared to control individuals. Hepatic fat showed a positive correlation with 
461 
markers of cholesterol synthesis and a negative correlation to cholesterol absorption [94].  
462 
Hypertrophied adipocytes display an accumulation of intracellular cholesterol and a decrease in 
463 
plasma membrane free cholesterol concentration; the latter is due to the increase in cell surface area. 
464 
The imbalance in membrane cholesterol concentration results in SREBP-2 activation and membrane 
465 
instability, which increases membrane permeability and disturbs the integrity of membrane 
466 
invaginations with a high concentration of signalling molecules (caveolae). These disturbances are 
467 
related to a reduction in insulin signalling and GLUT4 translocation and an increase in cytokine 
468 
secretion. Furthermore, the decrease in membrane cholesterol induces cholesterol synthesis [95, 96].  
469 
In NAFLD, hepatic cholesterol metabolism is dysregulated with an increase in hepatic 
470 
cholesterol synthesis, uptake of cholesterol-rich lipoproteins, alterations in intracellular 
471 
compartmentalization, changes in cholesterol absorption and secretion, altered intracellular 
472 
cholesterol esterification and de-esterification and modified nuclear regulators of cholesterol 
473 
homeostasis [96]. An increase in inflammation is one of the hallmarks of NAFLD progression to 
474 
NASH. Saturated fatty acids are capable of directly activate toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) [97, 98]. 
475 
NEFAs can induce macrophages to increase gene expression of TNF-α and IL-6 through TLR4 
476 
signalling [99]. Particularly palmitic acid, a saturated fatty acid, strongly stimulated IL-6 expression 
477 
in macrophages and pre-treatment with EPA and DHA inhibited the induction of TNF-α mRNA 
478 
expression by palmitic acid [99]. Decreased hepatic and adipose tissue inflammation prevented insulin 
479 
 14 
 
resistance in TLR4 knockout C57BL/6 mice fed a high fat diet. Saturated free fatty acids can produce 
480 
intracellular inflammatory signalling, but how this generates insulin resistance is still not clear [99]. 
481 
Lipid peroxidation of membranes and formation of antigens by lipoperoxidation products bound to 
482 
hepatocyte proteins can generate cell death and fibrosis [100].  Furthermore, the liver is exposed to 
483 
several gut-derived toxins and small intestine bacterial overgrowth and increase in gut permeability 
484 
happens in a high proportion of subjects with NAFLD [101].  
485 
 
486 
Inflammation and Omega-3 fatty acids 
487 
 
488 
 
One of the most prominent actions of marine n-3 PUFAs is their ability to modulate 
489 
inflammatory responses. N-3 PUFAs can act in several different forms to influence the inflammatory 
490 
process. Incorporation of PUFAs into membrane phospholipids of inflammatory cells maintains the 
491 
fluidity and alters lipid raft formation [102, 103]. Likewise membrane derived second messengers, 
492 
such as DAG or NEFAs, have their action influenced by their fatty acid composition, which can be 
493 
modified by n-3 PUFAs [103, 104]. Membrane non-esterified PUFAs and oxidized PUFA derivatives 
494 
can interact with surface or intracellular fatty acid receptors on inflammatory cells. Moreover, PUFAs 
495 
are able to indirectly influence inflammation through changes in complex lipids, lipoproteins, 
496 
metabolites and hormones [103].  
497 
Eicosanoids are generated from PUFAs with 20 carbons. They have a crucial role in 
498 
inflammation as both mediators and regulators of inflammatory processes. Arachidonic acid has a 
499 
high concentration in membrane phospholipids in cells involved in inflammation. As a result, 
500 
arachidonic acid is the main precursor for synthesis of eicosanoid mediators. These include 2-series 
501 
prostaglandins such as prostaglandin E2 and D2 formed in the COX pathway and 4-series leukotrienes 
502 
such as leukotriene B4 and E4 formed in the 5-lipoxygenase (LOX) pathway [105, 106]. Eicosanoids 
503 
have roles in the liver and might directly affect hepatocyte metabolism [107] or they can control the 
504 
regulation of hepatocyte metabolism by hormones [108, 109] or cytokines [110, 111]. Indeed, 
505 
prostaglandin E2 has been demonstrated to promote de novo lipogenesis and fat accumulation in 
506 
hepatocytes [112, 113].  
507 
Endocannabinoids are also a type of eicosanoid derived from membrane phospholipids. 
508 
Arachidonoyl ethanolamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol are the two major endocannabinoids involving 
509 
arachidonic acid [114, 115]. They act through CB1 and CB2 receptors and have both pro- and anti-
510 
inflammatory effects. Marine n-3 PUFAs can reduce arachidonic acid derived prostaglandins and 
511 
leukotrienes [116, 117] and arachidonic acid containing endocannabinoids [118, 119].  
512 
EPA is likewise used by COX and LOX enzymes, but the 3-series prostaglandins and 5-series 
513 
leukotrienes produced from EPA are less biologically active than the ones derived from arachidonic 
514 
acid [103]. Docosahexaenoyl ethanolamide and eicosapentaenoyl ethanolamide are endocannabinoids 
515 
that include marine n-3 PUFAs; these are also ligands for CB1 and CB2 receptors and have strong 
516 
 15 
 
anti-inflammatory actions [118, 119]. Furthermore, EPA and DHA can be used by COX and LOX 
517 
enzymes to generate anti-inflammatory and inflammation resolving compounds including resolvins, 
518 
protectins and maresins [120-123]. Among these, the pro-resolving actions of resolvin E1, resolvin 
519 
D1 and protectin D1 are well described and through these effects they act to limit tissue damage [103, 
520 
124]. Pro-resolving mediators inhibit transendothelial migration of neutrophils and decrease 
521 
inflammatory cytokine production; for example resolvin D1 impairs IL-1 production and protectin 
522 
D1 decreases IL-1 and TNF-α production [119, 124, 125]. Figure 4 illustrates the main classes of 
523 
lipid mediators derived from arachidonic acid, EPA and DHA. 
524 
Recent studies have begun to report the possible roles of resolvins and protectins in the liver 
525 
and in NAFLD. Resolvin D1 was able to attenuate hypoxia-induced expression of COX-2, IL-1β, IL-
526 
6, and C-C chemokine receptor type 7 in liver slices taken from mice with diet-induced obesity [126]. 
527 
This effect was not seen in liver slices depleted of macrophages, suggesting inflammatory 
528 
macrophages as the target for resolvin D1. Treating diet-induced obese mice with resolvin D1 
529 
increased adiponectin expression, reduced liver macrophage infiltration, skewed macrophages from 
530 
an M1- to an M2-like anti-inflammatory phenotype, induced a specific hepatic miRNA signature, and 
531 
reduced inflammatory adipokine expression [126]. An earlier study had identified a possible 
532 
protective role for the resolvin E1 receptor chemokine-like receptor 1 (CMKLR1) in NAFLD [127]. 
533 
CMKLR1 was identified in liver stellate cells, primary human hepatocytes, Kupffer cells and bile-
534 
duct cells, but was decreased in human and rodent fatty liver and in mice fibrotic liver. Adiponectin 
535 
strongly upregulated CMKLR1 in primary human hepatocytes and in liver tissue while hepatic 
536 
CMKLR1 was suppressed in the liver of adiponectin deficient mice [127]. A recent study showed that 
537 
pretreatment with resolvin D1 attenuated ER stress-induced apoptosis and decreased caspase 3 
538 
activity in HepG2 cells [128]. Furthermore, resolvin D1 significantly decreased tunicamycin-induced 
539 
triglyceride accumulation. These studies suggest that EPA and DHA derived pro-resolving mediators 
540 
could have a role in reversing the metabolic and inflammatory disturbances seen in NAFLD and they 
541 
support a role for cell and tissue enrichment in the precursor marine n-3 PUFAs. 
542 
In addition to modulation of the lipid mediator milieu (prostaglandins, leukotrienes, resolvins, 
543 
protectins etc.) marine n-3 PUFAs can decrease chemotaxis of human neutrophils and monocytes 
544 
[129] and can lower adhesion molecule expression on human endothelial cells [130]. Some of the 
545 
anti-inflammatory effects of marine n-3 PUFAs are due to decreased activation of the prototypical 
546 
pro-inflammatory transcription factor NFκB, which has key roles in regulating expression of genes 
547 
encoding many inflammatory cytokines, adhesion molecules and COX-2 [103].  
548 
Cytokines are small proteins secreted by a great variety of cell lines which are responsible for  
549 
modulation of the inflammatory response. The effects of marine n-3 PUFAs in production of 
550 
inflammatory cytokines seems to be strongly dependent on their dose [103]. C57BL/6 mice were fed 
551 
on a diet having fish oil and were then exposed to LP-BM5 murine leukemia virus to mimic HIV 
552 
 16 
 
infection. Compared to corn oil fed mice, those fed fish oil had improvements in immune function and 
553 
a decrease of pro-inflammatory cytokines which was linked to the decreased production of active 
554 
metabolites of arachidonic acid [131]. Many other in vitro and animal studies show that marine n-3 
555 
PUFAs can lower inflammatory cytokine production [119]. A study in healthy human subjects 
556 
supplemented with different doses of EPA + DHA and antioxidants showed a ‘U-shaped’ dose 
557 
response association between marine n-3 PUFAs and EPA incorporation in phospholipids and 
558 
decrease in TNF-α and IL-6 production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells, showing a greater 
559 
response to 1 g/d of EPA + DHA compared to 0.3 g and 2 g/d supplementation [132]. TNF-α is 
560 
elevated in NAFLD and seems to participate of the disease progression to NASH [7]. In contrast, 
561 
adiponectin is decreased in insulin resistance, obesity, diabetes and NAFLD [133]. Adiponectin has 
562 
anti-lipogenic and anti-inflammatory actions; therefore the increase in TNF-α and decrease in 
563 
adiponectin favours liver fat accumulation and inflammation [7, 133]. 
564 
NFκB is a trimer in the cytosol that contains an inhibitory subunit called the inhibitory 
565 
subunit of NFκB (IκB). Phosphorylation of IκB allows NFκB translocation to the nucleus, binding to 
566 
DNA and regulation of gene expression [134]. Several extracellular inflammatory stimuli can trigger 
567 
NFκB activation, often acting through toll-like receptor 4. Marine n-3 PUFAs are able to reduce IκB 
568 
phosphorylation and consequential activation of NFκB in macrophages [135]. NAFLD subjects 
569 
present an increase in oxidative stress, toll-like receptor expression, cytokines and adipokines, such as 
570 
TNF-α, IL-6, leptin and resistin, and a decrease in adiponectin [136]. Insulin resistance is closely 
571 
related to NAFLD and its progression, and additionally insulin resistance is responsible for the 
572 
increase of NEFA supply to liver [136]. NEFA and cholesterol accumulation in mitochondria are 
573 
associated with an increase in oxidative stress and TNF-α expression [137]. Also, high-fat and high 
574 
carbohydrate diets can alter gut “leakiness” leading to lipopolysaccharide translocation causing 
575 
endotoxemia, which contributes to inflammation [137]. NAFLD subjects presented enhanced gut 
576 
permeability and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth compared to healthy subjects [138].  
577 
 
578 
Treatment of NAFLD 
579 
 
580 
 
There is no specific pharmaceutical treatment for NAFLD and NASH. Lifestyle modification 
581 
is the first approach indicated for subjects with NAFLD. Exercise and weight loss are able to 
582 
ameliorate insulin resistance and reduce the amount of liver fat. A 10% reduction in body weight was 
583 
able to decrease the hepatic TAG content in about 50% of overweight male and female subjects [139]. 
584 
Another study found improvement in liver histology with >7% of body weight loss [140]. Physical 
585 
exercise seems to be able to reduce liver fat independent of weight loss, although weight loss is still 
586 
essential for NAFLD treatment. Physical exercise combined with energy restriction has conclusive 
587 
benefits in NAFLD [141]. Furthermore, exercise can result in weight loss without energy restriction in 
588 
a dose-response manner [142]. Below 150 min of aerobic exercise per week generates little weight 
589 
 17 
 
loss while  > 150 minutes per week is able to generate modest weight loss (~2-3 kg) and 225-420 
590 
minutes per week of aerobic exercise can result moderate weight loss (~5-7.5 kg) [142, 143]. 
591 
 
Bariatric surgery has shown positive results in NAFLD as reported from a meta-analysis [13]. 
592 
A reduction in steatosis was found in 91.6% of subjects, improvement or resolution of steatohepatitis 
593 
in 81.3% of subjects, and improvement or resolution of fibrosis in 65.5% of subjects who underwent 
594 
bariatric surgery [13]. However, the evolution of NAFLD after bariatric surgery seems to be closely 
595 
related to insulin resistance, since subjects with severe insulin resistance presented lower reduction in 
596 
liver fat after surgery than those who were less insulin resistant [144]. 
597 
 
Nine months of Orlistat™ combined with a diet of 1400 kcal per day and vitamin E (800 IU 
598 
per day) generated an 8% weight loss in subjects with NAFLD, but the weight loss was not different 
599 
from what was seen in the placebo group, which received vitamin E and the same low calorie diet and 
600 
lost 6% of weight [145]. Neither group exhibited differences in liver histology, but when groups were 
601 
analysed together it was possible to verify that > 9% of weight loss caused a reduction in serum 
602 
aminotransferases, insulin resistance, steatosis, ballooning and NAS [145]. Thiazolidinediones seem 
603 
to improve insulin sensitivity, decrease plasma glucose, haemoglobin A1c, steatosis and inflammation, 
604 
but have no effects on fibrosis [146]. However, weight gain and lower extremity edema  are 
605 
frequently reported side effects of thiozolidinediones [146]. Safety and efficacy of thiazolidinedione 
606 
(pioglitazone and rosiglitazone) should be evaluated in larger randomized controlled trials, as 
607 
suggested by Musso and colleagues [146]. Metformin administrated together with lifestyle 
608 
modification was able to decrease insulin resistance and plasma glucose and increase weight loss 
609 
associated with improved steatosis, ballooning, and inflammation [147]. However, paediatric subjects 
610 
with NAFLD did not benefit from 2 years metformin treatment when compared to a vitamin E 
611 
supplemented group and the placebo group [147]. Vitamin E has shown favourable effects improving 
612 
steatosis, ballooning, and inflammation compared to pioglitazone and placebo groups, but results are 
613 
highly variable and doses above 400 IU may be related to a rise in all cause-mortality [148]. 
614 
Ursodeoxycholic acid, a FXR ligand, was not able to treat NAFLD and high doses need further 
615 
investigation to ensure safety [146].  Marine n-3 PUFAs have shown positive effects on NAFLD 
616 
treatment and will be discussed in the next section.  
617 
 
618 
Algal and marine omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids for NAFLD treatment 
619 
 
620 
In the past few years several clinical studies have evaluated whether algal or marine n-3 
621 
PUFAs have a role in treatment of NAFLD. A total of 17 published reports were found that 
622 
investigated the effects of n-3 PUFAs on liver fat in human subjects with NAFLD. Fourteen of these 
623 
studies used mixtures of EPA and DHA, 2 studies used purified ethyl esters of EPA (EPA-EE) and 
624 
one study used DHA in the absence of EPA. Table 3 summarizes the results from these studies.  
625 
 
626

**Table 3** 
627 
 
628 
In a study including patients with hyperlipidaemia and NAFLD, the effects of fish oil (15 ml 
629 
daily providing 1.58 g/d DHA and 2.25 g/d EPA for 24 weeks) were compared with those of Orlistat 
630 
and Atorvastatin [149]. After the treatment, ultrasound revealed normal liver patterns in 35% of 
631 
patients receiving fish oil, 61% of patients receiving Atorvastatin and 86% of patients receiving 
632 
Orlistat. Fish oil treatment also decreased serum triglycerides (34%), total cholesterol (11%), AST 
633 
(61%), ALT (39%) and GGT (22%) as compared to the corresponding values at study entry. A 
634 
significant decrease (13%) in BMI was found only in the Orlistat group [149]. In another study with 
635 
fish oil (1 g/d for 12 months, EPA:DHA  being 0.9:1.5),  Capanni et al. reported that liver steatosis as 
636 
determined by ultrasound  (Doppler perfusion index) improved by more than 60%  after treatment 
637 
with fish oil however did not change in the control group  when compared to the pre-supplement 
638 
values [150]. Fish oil also decreased serum concentrations of ALT (73%), GGT (40%) and TAG 
639 
(59%), which did not change in the control group [150].  
640 
Two studies evaluated the effects of caloric restriction with and without fish oil 
641 
supplementation. One of these studies assessed the effects of fish oil (2 g/d for 6 mo, exact amounts of 
642 
EPA and DHA not specified) in combination with 30% caloric restriction and the caloric restriction 
643 
alone [151]. At the end of the study, BMI was decreased by 2.9% in the caloric restriction group and 
644 
by 6.3% in the group receiving fish oil and caloric restriction when compared to the pre-treatment 
645 
values.  As determined by ultrasound complete, partial or no regression of steatosis was seen in 33, 50 
646 
and 17% subjects in the fish oil group and in 0, 28, and 70%, respectively, in control group. The 
647 
results suggest that caloric restriction alone decreased liver fat an effect which was enhanced by fish 
648 
oil. However, only the marine n-3 PUFAs group showed a reduction of serum ALT (30%), GGT 
649 
(29%), TAG (25%), and TNF-α (19%) and HOMA-IR (25%) [151]. A subsequent study also imposed 
650 
25-30% caloric restriction along with seal oil (6 g/d for 24 wk) or placebo oil (unspecified, 6 g/d) to 
651 
subjects with NAFLD diagnosed by ultrasound [152].  In the end of the treatment period complete fat 
652 
regression was found in 19.7% of the subjects in the seal oil group, and 7.3% of subjects in the caloric 
653 
restriction alone group; corresponding overall fat regressions were 53.0% and 35.3%, respectively. 
654 
Serum ALT and TAG also decreased in both groups but the decrease was significantly bigger in the 
655 
seal oil than in the placebo oil group. It is worth noting that seal oil contains more DPA than fish oils 
656 
[153]. Results of these two studies involving caloric restriction and n-3 PUFA supplementation are 
657 
generally in agreement. 
658 
Another fish oil supplementation study determined liver fat using MRS which provides a 
659 
more quantitative estimation of liver fat than ultrasound [154]. This was a sequential study with 4 wk 
660 
of placebo oil (mixture of eladic, linoleic and palmitic oil, 9 g/d) followed by 8 wk of fish oil (9 g/d, 
661 
providing EPA 4.63 g/d and DHA 2.15 g/d). Sixteen overweight and obese (mean BMI 36.2 kg/m2, 
662 
range 27-61 kg/m2) subjects were involved mean pre-study liver fat of 10.6% (range 2.4-26.9%). Fish 
663 
 19 
 
oil supplementation significantly lowered plasma TAGs but did not alter liver fat. Small number, 
664 
heterogeneous population, and short duration of supplementation may be the basis for lack of change 
665 
in liver fat by a relatively high dose of fish oil [154]. 
666 
 Effects of purified ethyl ester of EPA (EPA-EE 2.7 g/d for 12 m) on markers of NAFLD and 
667 
NASH were investigated in 23 liver biopsy proven NASH patients, although repeat biopsy was 
668 
performed in only 7 subjects [155]. During EPA-EE supplementation, patients were allowed to 
669 
continue their medications and any dietary restrictions they had been following for the previous 12 
670 
months. At the end of EPA-EE supplementation, liver steatosis diagnosed by ultrasound was 
671 
decreased in 12 patients (52%, mean steatosis grades before and after EPA-EE were 2.1 and 1.6, 
672 
respectively). EPA-EE supplementation also significantly decreased serum concentrations of ALT, 
673 
AST, NEFAs, sTNF-R1, sTNF-R2, ferritin, and thioredoxin, and increased serum EPA content and 
674 
EPA/AA ratio. Results of second liver biopsy in 7 subjects showed that EPA-EE decreased steatosis 
675 
(29%), fibrosis (59%), lobular inflammation (48%), ballooning (44%) and NAS (39%). The results of 
676 
this small and heterogeneous study are fairly convincing that EPA-EE improves markers for both 
677 
NAFLD and NASH. However, these results are at variance from another large, multicentre study that 
678 
supplemented two concentrations of EPA-EE (1.8 g and 2.7 g/d for 12 mo) and performed liver 
679 
biopsies before and after the supplementation in all subjects [156]. In the latter study, neither dose of 
680 
EPA-EE had an effect on steatosis, inflammation, ballooning or fibrosis scores. The only beneficial 
681 
effect of EPA-EE in this study was a 4.3 % reduction in plasma TAGs by EPA-EE at 2.7 g/d when 
682 
compared with the corresponding values before the supplement. It is not possible to identify the exact 
683 
cause for these inconsistencies, but several factors including differences in the subject characteristics, 
684 
compliance with EPA-EE consumption, changes in diet and life style may have contributed to the 
685 
different results.  
686 
Since insulin resistance is often found in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) 
687 
and NAFLD, and females with PCOS frequently develop NAFLD [157]. Cussons and collaborators 
688 
evaluated the effects of fish oil on indicators of NAFLD in 25 obese women with PCOS in a 
689 
randomized cross over study [157]. Fish oil (4 g/d, providing EPA 1.08 g/d and DHA 2.24 g/d) and 
690 
the olive oil (4 g/d) were each given for 8 wk with a washout period of 8 wk in between. Liver fat as 
691 
determined by MRS was significantly decreased by fish oil compared to placebo in 12 women (mean 
692 
18.2 vs 14.8%). The other 13 women did not have NAFLD and hence the liver fat did not differ 
693 
between the two treatments (2.4 vs 2.7%). If the data from all women were pooled, the mean liver fat 
694 
after fish oil and placebo treatments was 8.2 and 10.4%, respectively. The reduction in liver fat within 
695 
8 wk of fish oil supplementation might be due to higher proportion of DHA used compared to that of 
696 
EPA and the high sensitivity of MRS to detect changes in liver fat. 
697 
The effects of DHA supplementation in the absence of EPA on markers of NAFLD and 
698 
NASH were assessed in a randomized controlled trial with obese children [158-160]. Sixty children 
699 
were divided into three groups of 20 each and were given DHA 250 and 500 mg/day or placebo (germ 
700 
 20 
 
oil providing linoleic acid 290 mg/d) for 24 mo combined with diet and exercise. Liver fat using 
701 
ultrasound and biochemical markers for NAFLD were determined every 6 mo and an additional liver 
702 
biopsy was carried out in the group receiving DHA 250 mg/d after 18 mo of treatment. Liver fat and 
703 
serum TAGs were significantly decreased and ISI increased while ALT did not change in both DHA 
704 
groups after 6 mo of DHA supplementation. There was no further decrease in liver fat at 12, 18, and 
705 
24 mo when compared to 6 mo of DHA supplementation. Liver biopsy after 18 mo of DHA 250 mg/d 
706 
revealed decreases in hepatic steatosis 70%, ballooning 70%, NAS 30% and PNHS 91%.  Authors of 
707 
this study also investigated the potential mechanisms by which DHA may reduce NAFLD and NASH. 
708 
Both DHA concentrations increased hepatic expression of GPR120, a macrophage lipid-sensing 
709 
receptor. DHA also modulated the macrophage response decreasing toll-like receptor and the TNF-α 
710 
signalling pathway [160]. In hepatocytes and macrophages, DHA decreased the nuclear translocation 
711 
of serine-311-phosphorylated NF-kB and GPR120-positive Mφ/Kupffer cell pool showing that DHA 
712 
could decrease the inflammatory macrophage pool and lead to an anti-inflammatory macrophage 
713 
polarization [160].  
714 
Subjects with well-controlled type 2 diabetes and biopsy proven NASH were part of aa 
715 
prospective double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. EPA and DHA (2.16 g and 1.44 g 
716 
per day, respectively) and corn oil as placebo were given to 18 and 19 patients, respectively.  After 48 
717 
wk of supplementation, a second liver biopsy was performed on all study participants. Marine n-3 
718 
PUFAs did not enhance hepatic histology or biochemical parameters, but liver fat and NAS were 
719 
decreased in the corn oil group. In addition to the lack of effect on liver fat, n-3 PUFAs increased 
720 
HOMA-IR. Besides the small number of participants, this study did not monitor tissue incorporation 
721 
of marine n-3 PUFAs or report any other measure of compliance. Hence poor compliance cannot be 
722 
excluded [161]. On the other hand, recent work showed an inverse correlation among liver fat 
723 
percentage and erythrocyte DHA enrichment [162]. This randomized double-blinded placebo trial 
724 
provided 1.84 g of EPA and 1.52 g of DHA per day (as ethyl esters) for a minimum of 15 and 
725 
maximum of 18 mo to 51 individuals or olive oil as a placebo to 52 individuals. Each 1% of DHA 
726 
enrichment of RBC fatty acids was associated with a 3.3 % decrease in hepatic fat as determined by 
727 
MRS. A 6% DHA enrichment was correlated with a 20% reduction in hepatic fat. In contrast to the 
728 
inverse correlation between RBC DHA and liver fat, RBC EPA concentration did not show a similar 
729 
association with liver fat. These data advocate that DHA might be more effective than EPA in 
730 
decreasing liver fat. Furthermore, the PNPLA 3 148M/M genotype was associated with higher liver 
731 
fat and lower DHA tissue enrichment in the end of the study [163]. 
732 
  Argo et al. investigated the effects of fish oil supplementation and increased aerobic exercise 
733 
along with decreased caloric intake in subjects with liver biopsy proven NASH in a randomized,  
734 
double blind and placebo control study [164]. This study included 34 subjects, 17 of which received 
735 
fish oil (3 g/d, providing EPA 1.05 g, DHA 0.75 g, and 0.24 g other n-3 PUFAs) and the other 17 
736 
received soybean oil as placebo for 12 months. In addition to the liver biopsy to determine NAS score 
737 
 21 
 
before and after the treatment, liver fat was also determined by MRI.  N-3 PUFAs significantly 
738 
decreased liver fat and markers of liver injury but not NAS.  Body weight was reduced in subjects 
739 
who received n-3 PUFAs, but the decrease in hepatic fat was independent of weight loss. However, 
740 
the improvement in markers of cell injury was only found in subjects who lost weight and received 
741 
fish oil. Furthermore, in subjects who lost weight, the effects of weight loss and n-3 PUFAs was 
742 
synergistic for reduction of liver fat. In this study n-3 PUFAs did not change insulin sensitivity and 
743 
serum ALT concentration.  
744 
The effects of algal oil containing DHA and EPA were studied on markers of fatty liver in 
745 
overweight/obese children with NAFLD determined by ultrasound in a randomized, double-blinded 
746 
placebo controlled trial [165]. The amount of algal oil was based on subject’s weight: < 40 kg 
747 
received 0.45 g of algal oil/per day (267 mg of DHA and 177.5 mg of EPA daily); 40-60 kg received 
748 
0.9 g/per day (534 mg of DHA and 355 mg of EPA daily) and > 60 kg received 1.3 g/per day (800 mg 
749 
of DHA and 532.5 mg of EPA daily) for 24 weeks. Sunflower was used as placebo in amounts similar 
750 
to those of algal oil. The n-3 PUFA group comprised 30 and placebo group 34 children. Both groups 
751 
also received nutritional counselling as part of their treatment. After 24 wk, there was no difference 
752 
between the groups for the number of subjects with decrease in serum ALT, liver hyperechoenicity, 
753 
insulin resistance and serum lipid levels. However, the n-3 PUFA group showed significant decreases 
754 
in serum AST and GGT, markers of liver damage, and increased serum adiponectin compared to 
755 
placebo group.  
756 
Another study also evaluated algae oil supplementation in children. In this double-blinded, 
757 
parallel-group, randomized, placebo controlled trial, 250 mg/d algal oil (39% DHA ≈ 97.5 mg/d) was 
758 
compared to 290 mg/d germ oil (mainly linoleic acid) in a 6 mo intervention. Children around 11 
759 
years old also received recommendations of a low-caloric diet (25-30 kcal/kg/d) and daily exercise 
760 
(60 min/day, 5 times/week). The study included 25 participants in the DHA group and 26 participants 
761 
in the placebo group. DHA supplementation decreased liver fat by 53.4% and the hepatic fat fraction 
762 
from 14% to 6.5% assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The reduction in hepatic fat was 
763 
bigger than in placebo group (22.6%), in which no differences were observed in the hepatic fat 
764 
fraction throughout the 6 mo trial. Furthermore, DHA supplementation reduced abdominal visceral 
765 
adipose tissue and epicardial adipose tissue compared to placebo group [166].        
766 
Obese adolescents with NAFLD aged 13-14 years old were randomly allocated into two 
767 
groups: PUFA group (n=56), receiving 1 g/d of PUFA containing 380 mg of EPA and 200 mg of 
768 
DHA (as described in the supplement’s manufacture website) and placebo group (n=52), which 
769 
received placebo (no description found in the article). All children received lifestyle counselling 
770 
comprising a diet with 25-30 kcal/kg/d for weight loss and scheduled physical activity (one hour, 
771 
three times per week) in addition to the encouragement of self-initiated physical activities. They were 
772 
followed for one year and NAFLD was evaluated by ultrasonography. After 12 mo, both groups had a 
773 
decrease in weight, BMI and hepatic steatosis. The improvements were more prominent in the PUFA 
774 
 22 
 
group, which had a higher increase in plasma HDL cholesterol, lower TAG, ALT, AST, insulin and 
775 
HOMA index and liver fat compared to placebo group. These results showed an additional effect of n-
776 
3 supplementation in children that underwent a lifestyle change [167]. 
777 
In another study, n-3 fatty acids supplementation was evaluated in a prospective, randomized, 
778 
controlled, unblinded trial. Subjects were separated in two groups: PUFA group (n=39) receiving 50 
779 
ml 1:1 ratio EPA:DHA added into daily diet and control group (n=30) receiving normal saline for 6 
780 
mo. Liver biopsies were done in the beginning and in the end of the study. After 6 mo treatment, 
781 
PUFA group showed improvement in the steatosis grade, necro-inflammatory grade, fibrosis stage 
782 
and ballooning score compared to control group. Both groups had an increase in physical activity and 
783 
a decrease in BMI and percentage of smokers. PUFA group also showed a decrease in the serum 
784 
levels of ALT, AST, TAG, total cholesterol, protein C reactive, malondialdehyde, type IV collagen 
785 
and pro-collagen type � pro-peptide [168]. 
786 
Nogueira et al. conducted a double-blinded, randomized, controlled trial in which n-3 PUFA 
787 
was provided as a mix of flaxseed oil and fish oil (0.945g n-3 per day, 64% ALA, 16% EPA and 21% 
788 
DHA) and compared to mineral oil (2 ml per day). Liver biopsies were performed in the beginning 
789 
and after 6 mo supplementation. N-3 group (n=27) and placebo group (n=23) showed an increase in 
790 
plasma n-3 fatty acids and a decrease in arachidonic acid. No differences between groups and among 
791 
basal and after 6 months supplementations were observed in liver histology, except from lobular 
792 
inflammation that was improved in the placebo group. However, both groups showed positive 
793 
association between individual increase in plasma n-3 fatty acids and the percentage of patients with 
794 
improvements in NAFLD markers. Subjects in the placebo group may have increased their n-3 intake, 
795 
which is supported by the enhancement in plasma n-3 fatty acids. This off-protocol n-3 ingestion may 
796 
have masked the possible benefits of n-3 in the n-3 group [169].  
797 
In summary, out of the seventeen published reports, eight studies used fish oil, one seal oil, 
798 
two purified EPA-EE, two a mixture of purified EPA-EE and DHA-EE; one a mixture of algal EPA 
799 
and DHA, two algal DHA in the absence of EPA and one a mix of flaxseed oil and fish oil.. Study 
800 
duration ranged from 2 to 24 mo, and the daily amount of n-3 PUFAs used ranged from 250 mg DHA 
801 
to 6.8 g of a mixture of EPA and DHA. Five studies also involved dietary restriction and exercise 
802 
along with n-3 PUFA supplementation. Results from these 5 studies suggest that n-3 PUFAs improve 
803 
NAFLD independent of weight loss. Seven studies with fish oil, 1 with seal oil, 1 with EPA-EE, 2 
804 
with algal DHA demonstrated a decrease in markers of NAFLD. Two studies with fish oil, 1 with 
805 
EPA-EE, 2 with a mixture of algal EPA and DHA and 1 with a mix of flaxseed oil and fish oil did not 
806 
find any changes in liver fat or other markers of inflammation. The failure of n-3 PUFAs to decrease 
807 
markers of NAFLD in these studies may be due to short duration, poor compliance, patient specific 
808 
factors and the sensitivity of the methods used. One of the studies showed that the decrease in liver fat 
809 
was associated with RBC enrichment with DHA but not EPA. The 2 fish oil studies that did not find 
810 
 23 
 
reduction in liver fat with n-3 PUFAs used almost twice the amount of EPA compared to DHA. These 
811 
findings advocate that DHA is more effective than EPA in the reduction of NAFLD. 
812 
 
813 
Conclusions 
814 
NAFLD is growing public health concern due to a rapid growth in its worldwide incidence. 
815 
The balance between hepatic fatty acid synthesis and utilization and between hepatic uptake and 
816 
export seem to be dysregulated in NAFLD. Obesity is one of the main risk factors for NAFLD 
817 
establishment and dietary habits are therefore closely related to its pathophysiology. Furthermore, 
818 
increased hepatic inflammation and insulin resistance are related to NAFLD progression to NASH, 
819 
which can lead to more severe and irreversible liver disorders. Marine n-3 PUFAs are able to 
820 
modulate fatty acid metabolism decreasing de novo fatty acid synthesis and increasing hepatic fatty 
821 
acid β-oxidation. They also have anti-inflammatory effects. Supplementation with marine n-3 PUFAs 
822 
has been shown to decrease hepatic fat content in several studies and seems to be an alternative 
823 
treatment for NAFLD subjects, especially when combined with dietary restriction. Marine n-3 PUFAs 
824 
are safe, well tolerated and have few side effects. A minimum of 1.52 g of DHA and 1.08 g of EPA 
825 
per day offered for at least 6 months seems to be required to have an effect. A higher percentage of 
826 
DHA in relation to EPA also appears to be favourable. Adequately sized and properly controlled 
827

Figure 3. Insulin resistance and its metabolic effects. The increase in hepatic TAG, cholesterol and 
1321 
DAG is consequent to the decrease in fatty acid β-oxidation and increase in de novo fatty acid and 
1322 
TAG synthesis. These alterations lead to an increase in hepatic oxidative stress and inflammation. 
1323 
Insulin resistance is considered one of the main reasons for hepatic TAG accumulation, which is 
1324 
considered the first “hit” to NAFLD development. Insulin resistant adipose tissue increases lipolysis 
1325 
and is more inflamed, resulting in higher levels of circulation NEFAs, which can be taken up by the 
1326 
liver and esterified into TAG, and of inflammatory mediators. In addition, insulin resistance decreases 
1327 
the glucose uptake and the glycogen synthesis in muscle cells, causing less glucose utilization and 
1328 
raising the circulating glucose levels. Glucose can be taken up by liver by an insulin-independent 
1329 
transporter and be converted to pyruvate. Pyruvate is a precursor of acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA, 
1330 
which can be converted into fatty acids through de novo lipogenesis reactions.
