Abstract
Objectives—We compared an evidence-based model of group prenatal care to traditional 
individual prenatal care on birth, neonatal, and reproductive health outcomes.
Methods—We performed a multisite cluster randomized controlled trial in 14 health centers in 
New York City (2008–2012). We analyzed 1148 pregnant women aged 14 to 21 years, at less than 
24 weeks of gestation, and not at high obstetrical risk. We assessed outcomes via medical records 
and surveys.
Results—In intention-to-treat analyses, women at intervention sites were significantly less likely 
to have infants small for gestational age (< 10th percentile; 11.0% vs 15.8%; odds ratio = 0.66; 
95% confidence interval = 0.44, 0.99). In as-treated analyses, women with more group visits had 
better outcomes, including small for gestational age, gestational age, birth weight, days in neonatal 
intensive care unit, rapid repeat pregnancy, condom use, and unprotected sex (P = .030 to < .001). 
There were no associated risks.
Conclusions—CenteringPregnancy Plus group prenatal care resulted in more favorable birth, 
neonatal, and reproductive outcomes. Successful translation of clinical innovations to enhance 
care, improve outcomes, and reduce cost requires strategies that facilitate patient adherence and 
support organizational change.
Bundling health care services—integrating prevention and treatment—is a strategy to meet 
“triple aim” goals: enhanced health care quality, improved health outcomes, and lower 
cost.1,2 The institutional benefits of bundling health care include reduced infrastructure and 
cost, the opportunity to provide additional services, and collaborative partnerships. Patient 
benefits include integrated services and reduced barriers to care.
Pregnancy is an important window of opportunity, with frequent health care contact. 
Nonetheless, adverse birth outcomes remain leading causes of US infant morbidity and 
mortality3 and are concentrated among disadvantaged groups.4 Pregnant adolescents also 
have higher rates of sexually transmitted infection (STI) than do their nonpregnant 
counterparts and those who are nulliparous.5 Taken together, adolescent women from 
socially disadvantaged groups face adverse reproductive and sexual health disparities.
Yet, bundled preventive interventions are not as common as are those that address individual 
risk factors.6 Regarding pregnancy, interventions among pregnant adolescents target either 
reproductive or sexual health, both with limited effectiveness. Clinical interventions such as 
progesterone administration and cervical cerclage prevent preterm birth in singleton 
gestations with previous preterm birth or short cervix.7 However, one half of women who 
deliver preterm have no known risks.8 An independent review of prenatal care models found 
only 1 randomized controlled trial (RCT) that demonstrated improved health outcomes.9 
This study, from our research team, compared CenteringPregnancy group prenatal care to 
standard individual prenatal care. Our previous research documented that women 
randomized to group prenatal care had a 33% lower rate of preterm delivery.10 We also

 documented improved outcomes among women randomized to group prenatal care that 
bundled reproductive health promotion (CenteringPregnancy Plus): greater than 50% 
reduction in rapid repeat pregnancy among all women and incident STI among 
adolescents.11
Translating evidence to routine health care practice is a National Institutes of Health 
priority.12 It is important to determine whether clinical interventions with demonstrated 
efficacy can be implemented to produce clinical benefits comparable to those observed 
during efficacy studies. First developed in 1968 to improve well-child care, group care 
consists of the same components of individual care visits coupled with education and skills 
building and takes place in a group of patients.13 Previous research across a range of health 
conditions suggests many clinical and psychosocial benefits, including improved patient 
self-management, adherence, satisfaction, and clinical outcomes.14 More time between 
patients and health care providers results in more patient-centered care.
We conducted a multisite cluster RCT to assess the clinical effectiveness of group prenatal 
care bundled with reproductive health promotion compared with the clinical effectiveness of 
standard individual prenatal care. Cluster randomized trials can evaluate changes in service 
provision under conditions of actual use and are characterized by their multilevel nature15: 
in this case, pregnant women clustered into prenatal care settings. We hypothesized that 
women at clinical sites randomly assigned to deliver group prenatal care would have better 
reproductive and sexual health outcomes than those of women at sites randomized to 
individual care and that greater exposure to group prenatal care would be associated with 
better outcomes. Specifically, a priori outcomes included gestational age at delivery, infant 
birth weight, and small for gestational age as well as incident STI, rapid repeat pregnancy, 
and behavioral risk factors (e.g., condom use). We also included admission to and days in 
the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).
METHODS
We conducted a cluster RCT16 in 14 clinical sites, including 4 community health centers and 
10 hospitals in New York City that serve predominantly low-resource women. We calculated 
the sample size using Optimal Design for Multilevel and Longitudinal Research, version 
0.23 (http://www.wtgrantfoundation.org). On the basis of results from our previous study 
(d=0.21–0.39), with power at 0.80 and α set to 0.05, we needed 14 sites and 90 patients per 
site to detect a small or medium effect size of d=0.25. We determined these estimates by an 
intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.001.
We initially selected clinical sites on the basis of a convenience sample. They could not be 
conducting group prenatal care, but they had to be committed to changing their practice to 
offer group prenatal care (including clinical leadership support) and have sufficient space. 
Sites were aware that they would be trained to offer group care either immediately 
(intervention condition) or after completion of study recruitment (delayed intervention 
condition). To minimize selection bias, we identified health centers and recruited before 
randomization. We randomized sites using a computer-generated sequence in stratified 
blocks to account for lags in recruitment and the time required for training and

 implementation. We enrolled participants between 2008 and 2011, with follow-up 1 year 
postpartum completed in 2012.Wethen offered training and support to sites randomized to 
individual care to implement group care.
Patient Selection and Recruitment
Research staff referred adolescents aged 14 to 21 years attending an initial prenatal care visit 
at participating clinical sites to the study or recruited them directly. We focused on 
adolescents because they are the most vulnerable to adverse perinatal and reproductive 
health outcomes. Inclusion criteria were pregnancy at less than 24 weeks gestation, 
pregnancy not considered high risk, ability to speak English or Spanish, and willingness to 
participate in group prenatal care. To reduce poststratification patient selection bias,17 we 
asked all women to consent to receive group prenatal care, if available at their site, without 
specifying at recruitment whether group care was available.
Women completed structured interviews at 4 time points: during second (mean ± SD=18.72 
± 3.29 weeks gestational age) and third (mean ± SD=29.99 ± 5.28 weeks gestational age) 
trimester as well as postpartum at 6 (mean ± SD =26.07 ± 5.21 weeks) and 12 (mean ± 
SD=57.30 ± 13.50 weeks) months. We completed interviews in English (77.7%) or Spanish 
(22.3%) using audio handheld assisted personal interview technology. Respondents listened 
over headphones to spoken questions displayed on computer screens. They were paid $20 
per interview. Trained staff reviewed maternal and child medical records by using case 
report forms to extract uniform data.
Intervention
We implemented CenteringPregnancy Plus group prenatal care. Members of the research 
team at Yale University and at the Centering Healthcare Institute (Boston, MA) provided 
training and resources. Training included (1) onsite organizational preparation to assist with 
conversion of health systems to accommodate group care (e.g., staffing, scheduling); (2) 2-
day basic training with clinical and administrative staff that included group prenatal care and 
research overviews, logistics and planning (e.g., recruitment, scheduling), curriculum 
review, and skills building on facilitative leadership and HIV and STI prevention; (3) 
webcasts to review session content; and (4) advanced facilitation training for providers who 
had run an entire group series.
Described in detail previously,10,11,18 CenteringPregnancy Plus begins with standard clinical 
intake (a history and a physical) conducted individually. Thereafter, all care occurs within 
the group except concerns requiring privacy or urgent medical attention. Groups included 8 
to 12 women of the same gestational age, and a credentialed clinician (e.g., obstetrician, 
midwife) and cofacilitator (e.g., nurse, medical assistant) facilitated the groups. There were 
10 sessions lasting 120 minutes that followed the clinical guidelines of the American 
Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.
At arrival, participants engaged in self-management activities, including taking weight and 
blood pressure, charting progress in health records, and completing brief self-assessment 
surveys to trigger discussion. The clinician completed fundal height and heart rate 
monitoring in a private area within the group space. Twenty hours of group prenatal care

 provided much more extensive care, including facilitated discussions on many issues related 
to pregnancy, childbirth, and postpartum (Massey et al.18 provide a detailed description). 
Structured reproductive health promotion activities were delivered during 4 of the 10 
sessions and included activities to improve sexual self-efficacy, HIV knowledge, 
interpersonal sexual communication, perceived risk, and social norms.
Study Endpoints
We specified primary outcomes a priori during clinical trial registration (http://
www.clinicaltrials.gov, NCT00628771). Primary birth and neonatal outcomes consisted of 
gestational age at delivery dichotomized as term or preterm (< 37 weeks); infant birth weight 
dichotomized as normal or low birth weight (< 2500 g); small for gestational age (< 10th 
percentile in weight for gestational age); and breastfeeding initiation.
We also examined NICU rates and length of stay as a major driver of cost. Primary 
reproductive outcomes included incident STI 12 months postpartum, which was diagnosed 
via urine-based ligase chain reaction; rapid repeat pregnancy within 12 months; and 2 
behavioral indicators of risk in the past 6 months (i.e., percentage condom use, number of 
unprotected sexual intercourse occasions).
Statistical Analyses
We performed primary analyses on our prespecified hypotheses using intention-to-treat 
principles, with study condition (group vs individual care) as the predictor. We employed 
multilevel mixed models to control for interdependence owing to site clustering (e.g., 
gestational age ICC=0.002; condom use ICC= 0.013), with effect of site modeled as a 
random effect.15 We conducted linear models for continuous variables, logistic models for 
dichotomous variables, and models with Poisson distribution for count data and skewed 
distributions (e.g., gestational age in days, days in NICU).
In real-world clinical settings, where nonadherence is expected,19 significant deviations in 
study protocol may result in biased estimates of the magnitude of treatment effects. When 
nonadherence to study protocol is substantial, effects of treatment as assigned and as 
received should be estimated separately.20 Therefore, we conducted planned as-treated 
analyses to identify potential associations between exposure and outcomes. We classified 
patients according to the amount of intervention received, with the number of group visits 
(range=0–10) as the primary predictor. We assigned patients at sites randomized to 
individual care and those at sites randomized to group care but who attended no group visits 
a “0.” Unadjusted models included only the effect of number of group prenatal visits 
attended.
Adjusted models included the number of group visits, controlling for characteristics 
associated with group attendance; specifically, those who attended more group visits were 
more likely to be born outside the United States, to live with their family of origin, to be 
nulliparous, to have begun intervention earlier in pregnancy, and to have attended fewer 
individual care visits (all P≤.02). For outcomes with baseline data (e.g., percentage condom 
use, unprotected sexual intercourse), adjusted models also included baseline scores. Finally, 
we used post hoc analyses to evaluate the impact of receiving at least the minimal

 intervention dose: 50% of the group prenatal visits scheduled (5 of 10). We conducted 
analyses using SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 21.0 (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY).
RESULTS
As shown in the CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) diagram (Figure 
1), 16 clinical sites were originally included; 14 agreed to randomization, and 13 remained 
in the study. One site randomized to intervention never conducted group prenatal care and 
dropped out after recruiting only 35 patients. Two small sites (1 per condition) recruited 63 
and 67 women, respectively. All other sites recruited at least 80 women (80–106), with 610 
women recruited at intervention sites and 623 women recruited at delayed intervention sites. 
Follow-up rates were comparable.
Participant Characteristics
Of the 1549 eligible women, 1233 enrolled (participation rate=80%). Those who agreed to 
participate were more likely to be Black (38% vs 27%; χ2(1)=23.36; P<.001) and were 
slightly younger (mean ± SD=18.63 ± 1.73 vs 19.00 ± 1.67; t(1548)= –3.46; P=.001). We 
limited analyses to women with birth outcomes data, singleton birth, and no history of 
preterm birth. The final analytic sample included 1148 women.
After controlling for intraclass correlation (patients within clinical settings), the only 
difference was that women at sites randomized to group care were more likely to be married 
(14.9% vs 10.5%; Table 1). There were no significant differences in any clinical 
characteristics, such as parity, gestational age at study entry, or history of STI.
Intention-to-Treat Analysis
Participants in group prenatal care were less likely to deliver a baby small for gestational age 
than were those in individual care (11.0% vs 15.8%, respectively; Table 2)—a 34% risk 
reduction (odds ratio [OR]=0.66; 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.44, 0.99; P=.04). These 
results were stable after adjusting for both clinical sites and prenatal care groups. Survival 
analyses indicated that there were also differences in the timing of births for small for 
gestational age (χ2(1)= 5.79; P=.02). Specifically, women in group prenatal care were less 
likely to have a small-for-gestational-age infant, and when they did the child was born at a 
later gestational age.
Small-for-gestational-age babies born to mothers at clinical sites that were randomized to 
group care were slightly less likely to be born preterm (8.3% vs 13.6%, respectively) and 
less likely to be admitted to the NICU (14.0% vs 18.7%, respectively); however, we are 
referring to only 148 infants born small for gestational age, and these differences were not 
statistically significant. There were no differences in other birth, neonatal, or reproductive 
health outcomes on the basis of intention-to-treat analyses (Table 2).
As-Treated Analysis
At sites randomized to group prenatal care, 22% of women (n=127) attended no group visits; 
they received an average of 8.65 (SD=4.25) individual visits. Among those who attended at 
Ickovics et al.

 least 1 group visit, the mean number of group visits was 5.29 (SD=2.50; range=1–10), 
indicating only modest adherence; these women also attended an average of 5.61 (SD=3.55) 
individual prenatal care visits, for a total of 9.30 (SD=3.82) visits. Women at sites 
randomized to individual care attended an average of 8.88 (SD=4.19) individual prenatal 
care visits. There was no difference in the total number of prenatal care visits between study 
conditions (B [SE]=1.06 [0.68]; P=.15).
The greater the number of group prenatal care visits that women attended, controlling for the 
number of individual prenatal care visits attended, the lower their odds of delivering a baby 
small for gestational age, preterm, or low birth weight (Table 3). Although there was no 
difference in admission to the NICU, attending more group prenatal care sessions was 
associated with having babies who spent fewer days in the NICU (B [SE]=−0.30 [0.02]; P<.
001). Regarding reproductive health outcomes, attending more groups was associated with a 
lower likelihood of rapid repeat pregnancy, more condom use (B [SE]=1.43 [0.62]; P=.02), 
and fewer acts of unprotected sexual intercourse (B [SE]= −0.03 [0.01]; P<.01). Results 
were unchanged when we included a restricted range of visits from 0 to 7, taking into 
account person-time of observation because women naturally entered prenatal care at 
different points during pregnancy and had varying lengths of gestation.21
Finally, we conducted post hoc analyses to evaluate the impact of receiving at least a 
minimal dose: 50% of group prenatal visits scheduled (5 of 10). Five group prenatal care 
visits was the mean and modal number of visits for those at sites randomized to group care. 
The results of post hoc analyses generally replicated the results of the as-treated analyses (all 
P≤.05). Women who attended at least 50% of group sessions were significantly less likely 
than those who attended 4 or fewer sessions to have a preterm birth (4.1% vs 12.0%) or low 
birth weight baby (5.2% vs 10.7%) and had babies who spent fewer days in the NICU (mean 
± SD=0.81 ± 2.44 days vs 1.99 ± 9.51 days). Women who attended at least 50% of the group 
sessions also were less likely to experience rapid repeat pregnancy (16.9% vs 29.4%), used 
condoms more frequently (mean ± SD=50.30% ± 40.43% vs 39.84% ± 39.83%), and 
engaged in fewer acts of unprotected sex (mean ± SD=6.75 ± 14.14 vs 7.55 ± 13.00).
DISCUSSION
This cluster RCT demonstrated the effectiveness of group prenatal care bundled with a 
reproductive health promotion intervention in real-world clinical settings for decreasing the 
risk of delivering small-for-gestational-age infants. Although statistical significance was 
modest (P=.04), our effect size was moderate and in line with other intervention effects 
shown to prevent small for gestational age, such as antiplatelet therapy and 
supplementation.22 Being born small for gestational age has social and health implications 
across the developmental life span, including neurodevelopmental delays, obesity, and 
chronic diseases such as adult-onset diabetes and hypertension.23,24 Barker suggests that 
chronic disease originates during intrauterine development and that impaired fetal growth 
permanently changes the body’s structure, function, and metabolism.25 Previously having a 
small for gestational age infant also increases the risk of future poor reproductive 
outcomes.26

 Although other birth, neonatal, and reproductive health outcomes were not significantly 
different using intention-to-treat analyses, in as-treated analyses a greater number of group 
prenatal care visits was associated with better health outcomes, such as a lower risk of 
preterm and low birth weight, fewer days in the NICU, and a lower risk of rapid repeat 
pregnancy—even after controlling for the number of traditional individual prenatal care 
visits. These findings are consistent with those of a previous RCT in which group prenatal 
care resulted in better reproductive and sexual health outcomes.10,11
This trial was designed to determine whether an evidence-based model of group prenatal 
care could be implemented in a broader range of urban clinical settings. We did not replicate 
the finding that demonstrated a reduction in rates of preterm delivery using intention-to-treat 
analyses. Instead, we found a slight but significant reduction in the risk for being small for 
gestational age. In this translational study, we observed substantial adherence challenges: 1 
in 5 women at clinical sites randomized to group prenatal care never attended any group 
prenatal care, and the average number of group visits was 5 of 10.
Also, there was variation in terms of implementation fidelity. For example, clinical sites with 
fewer adolescents struggled to fill groups with women who met study inclusion for age. 
Consequently, some sites populated groups with patients with a broader range of gestational 
ages (i.e., across a 2-month period, resulting in some patients entering groups later and 
others delivering earlier). Other sites formed smaller groups and had to cancel sessions if too 
few women showed up for group care. This illustrates, in part, barriers faced by clinical sites 
when moving from individual patient care to scheduled group visits27 and likely reduced 
statistical power to detect intention-to-treat effects. Improving adherence to group care may 
result in positive outcomes, highlighting the need for patient support to attend prenatal care 
and implementation support at the practice and health system levels.
Limitations and Strengths
There are several limitations to our study. First, neither clusters nor participants could be 
blinded to study condition. However, bias was minimized by postrecruitment randomization 
(at the site level), and patients did not know whether their site was randomized to group or 
individual care until after consent. We have no information on content or emphasis of 
standard care. Low adherence could make it difficult to detect differences between 
conditions. As-treated analyses indicated the potential for more widespread effects to be 
observed with greater patient adherence, but these results should be interpreted with caution. 
Sites were urban health centers serving predominantly disadvantaged women of color; 
therefore, results may not be generalizable to other settings.
Furthermore, participants were limited to adolescents aged 14 to 21 years at higher risk for 
adverse maternal–child health outcomes28; thus, results may not be generalizable to older 
women. However, results could have implications for reducing persistent racial and ethnic 
disparities in birth and sexual health outcomes via the implementation of group prenatal 
care.29 Finally, as with any study—especially following participants for more than 1 year—
other clinical, behavioral, and psychosocial factors could have confounded our results.

 The cluster randomized design has many strengths, including evaluating effectiveness under 
conditions of actual use and the possibility of generalizing results to clinical practices 
similar to those in this trial.20 This design maintains the rigor and internal validity of a RCT 
while enhancing external validity through essential methodological features identified by 
Glasgow: (1) representative patients (i.e., urban settings, not homogenous nor least 
medically complex), (2) diverse ambulatory clinical practice settings (i.e., not just those with 
greatest expertise or the most resources), (3) a comparison condition that represents standard 
of care rather than no treatment, and (4) multiple outcomes.30 Results have implications for 
innovations in prenatal care, including clinical adoption, implementation, and sustainability.
Conclusions
Future research must replicate the effects of group prenatal care on maternal and child 
outcomes and identify potential mechanisms of effect: How does group care improve 
outcomes? Is it additional time afforded for education and skills building in groups, 
opportunity for social support, or inclusion of self-care that relates to outcomes observed? 
Adherence is another critical issue: What are patient and provider factors that influence 
adherence to prenatal care and how can we promote adherence (e.g., routine text messaging 
not widely available during study)? Cost and cost-effectiveness analyses are needed to 
evaluate potential savings and conditions under which cost savings may be incurred. Finally, 
future translational, dissemination, and implementation research should continue to identify 
factors that influence uptake, fidelity, sustainability, and the scale-up of innovations in 
patient-centered care that could improve health outcomes for mothers and babies.
Evidence of effectiveness is essential but not sufficient to ensure the adoption and 
sustainability of group prenatal care. Despite interest and investment in translational 
research, there remains an enormous gap between what we know can maximize the quality 
of health care delivery and what occurs in practice.31 Fuchs and Milstein argue that 
innovations do not diffuse quickly in health systems, owing in part to resistance from 
physicians, hospital administrators, insurers, and others.32 Group medical visits are 
challenging because they fundamentally trans-form traditional practice and require 
operational changes (e.g., scheduling, space, clinical workflow); however, group visits have 
been used in diverse settings and have resulted in benefits for patients, clinicians, and 
organizations.14
The successful translation of clinical innovations requires strategies that facilitate practice 
improvements and organizational change.30,33,34 It requires a commitment to 
implementation research and a willingness to change clinical practices to improve patient 
and population health. This may be no more important than during prenatal care, when 
interventions may lead to improved health trajectories across the life span for mothers and 
their children.

gonorrheae; STI = sexually transmitted infection.
Population size was n = 1148. Analyses were on the basis of the actual number of group prenatal care visits attended, regardless of study condition. 
All patients at clinical sites randomized to individual care received a “0” for number of group visits as did those who were at clinical sites 
randomized to group care but never attended (n = 127).
aAnalyses controlled for correlates of group visit attendance: born outside United States, living situation, nulliparous, gestational age at study entry, 
and individual care prenatal visits.
bNot registered as primary outcome but included as driver of cost. Number of days in the NICU was associated with number of group visits: each 
increase in the number of group prenatal care visits attended reduced the number of days in the NICU by 0.30 (B [SE] = −0.30 [0.02]; P < .001).
cRestricted to women with laboratory testing for CT and NG 1 year postpartum.
