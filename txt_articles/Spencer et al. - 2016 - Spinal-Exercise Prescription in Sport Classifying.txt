Context:
Identification of strategies to prevent spinal injury,
optimize rehabilitation, and enhance performance is a priority for
practitioners. Different exercises produce different effects on
neuromuscular performance. Clarity of the purpose of a
prescribed exercise is central to a successful outcome. Spinal
exercises need to be classified according to the objective of the
exercise and planned physical outcome.
Objective:
To define the modifiable spinal abilities that
underpin optimal function during skilled athletic performance,
clarify the effect of spinal pain and pathologic conditions, and
classify spinal exercises according to the objective of the
exercise and intended physical outcomes to inform training and
rehabilitation.
Design:
Qualitative study.
Data Collection and Analysis:
We conducted a qualitative
consensus method of 4 iterative phases. An exploratory panel
carried out an extended review of the English-language
literature using CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE, and PubMed to
identify key themes and subthemes to inform the definitions of
exercise categories, physical abilities, and physical outcomes.
An expert project group reviewed panel findings. A draft
classification was discussed with physiotherapists (n ¼ 49) and
international experts. Lead physiotherapy and strength and
conditioning teams (n ¼ 17) reviewed a revised classification.
Consensus was defined as unanimous agreement.
Results:
After the literature review and subsequent analy-
sis, we defined spinal abilities in 4 categories: mobility, motor
control, work capacity, and strength. Exercises were subclassi-
fied by functionality as nonfunctional or functional and by spinal
displacement as either static (neutral spinal posture with no
segmental displacement) or dynamic (dynamic segmental
movement). The proposed terminology and classification sup-
port commonality of language for practitioners.
Conclusions:
The spinal-exercise classification will support
clinical reasoning through a framework of spinal-exercise
objectives that clearly define the nature of the exercise
prescription required to deliver intended physical outcomes.
Key Words:
spine, back, classification
Key Points

njury epidemiologic data have suggested that the
prevalence of back pain in athletes ranges from 30%
to 50%.1,2 Injury-surveillance data of Great Britain
Olympic athletes collated by the Injury/Illness Performance
Project under the auspices of the UK Sport/English Institute
of Sport (EIS) between 2009 and 2012 across 11 Olympic
sports have indicated that thoracic and lumbar spine injury
(LSI) accounted for 14.2% of all injuries and resulted in
737 days missed from training and competition.3 Injury is
prevalent in sports that place substantial demands on the
spine through intensive or repetitive directional loading,4,5
including gymnastics, diving, weight lifting, cricket, and
rowing. Identifying strategies to prevent spinal injury,
optimize spinal rehabilitation, and enhance spinal perfor-
mance is a priority for practitioners.
Spinal function has been defined as the ability to create,
absorb, and transfer force and motion to the terminal
appendicular segment during the performance of skilled
motor tasks.6 Theoretical definitions of core stability (CS),
however, do not represent the relationship between passive
anatomical structures and the complex neuromuscular
system coordination required to maintain spinal integrity
under varying loads and motion demands. The nature of
spinal integrity during sport activity is task specific.
Therefore, the theoretical basis of ‘‘optimal’’ movement
efficiency is an expression of the coordinated interaction of
numerous physical abilities underpinning spinal function.7
Specificity of training enables the development of
targeted outcome measures to enhance performance.
During rehabilitation, practitioners also must consider the

 effect of pathologic conditions and pain on specific physical
abilities and identify effective strategies to address
dysfunction. The use of exercise is accepted unequivocally
as part of a multifaceted approach to training and
rehabilitation.8 Identification of suboptimal physical per-
formance forms the basis of clinical reasoning to inform
exercise prescription.
Historically, the nature of spinal-exercise prescription has
been subject to widespread debate9,10 centered on the relative
understanding and importance of CS and driven by its role in
the management of chronic low back pain (LBP).11 Whereas
researchers12–15 have made substantial progress in detailing
the components of spinal stability and its relationship with
spinal mobility, unidimensional paradigms of exercise
prescription persist. For example, attempts have been made
to isolate groups of core muscles or their function despite the
important synergistic contributions of many different
muscles to balance stability and movement demands.16
Furthermore, given that different exercises produce different
effects on neuromuscular performance, use of the term CS is
problematic, as it does not adequately define the intent of an
exercise, and it often is used by practitioners attempting to
deliver several different training or rehabilitation outcomes.
Therefore, spinal exercises, and often exercises in general,
are frequently described by name, equipment used, or place
performed (eg, Pilates/core exercises, mat exercises, gym-
nasium exercises) rather than by intent, loading, and
execution. If exercise intention is not delineated, miscom-
munication may occur among practitioners. Therefore, the
purpose of our study was 2-fold: (1) to define the modifiable
spinal abilities that underpin optimal function during skilled
athletic performance and clarify the effect of spinal pain and
pathologic conditions and (2) to classify spinal exercises
according to the objective of the exercise and intended
physical outcomes to inform training and rehabilitation.
METHODS
We used a qualitative consensus method of 4 iterative
phases (Figure 1). A conceptual framework was defined to
underpin the study methods (Figure 2). The framework
formed an analytical tool that was used in phase 1 to
organize the ideas emerging from the literature. It provided
a structure of starting principles and assumptions that
illustrate a broad concept.
Phase 1
An exploratory panel consisting of 2 senior physiother-
apists and 2 senior strength and conditioning coaches (S.S.,
A.W., and 2 nonauthors) with extensive experience in
spinal training and rehabilitation at the EIS was formed to
carry out an extended review of the literature to (1) identify
modifiable spinal abilities defining optimal function during
skilled athletic performance, (2) clarify the effect of spinal
pain and pathologic conditions on specific physical
abilities, and (3) define categories of exercise objectives
and physical outcomes (Table 1). The literature search used
sensitive topic-based strategies designed for each database.
Search dates were from database inception to July 31, 2013,
to inform phase 1. We subsequently updated the search to
July 31, 2015, to reflect contemporary literature.
We searched the databases of CINAHL, EMBASE,
MEDLINE, and PubMed. The search strategy consisted
of search terms informed by the conceptual framework. For
anatomical and neuromuscular interactions in functional
spinal control, we used the terms core, function (spinal),
neuromuscular (control), and stability (spinal). Search
terms for spinal abilities defining optimal function during
skilled athletic performance were mobility, motor control,
performance (athletic/sporting), power, rate of force
development (RFD), strength, and strength endurance.
For the effect of spinal pain and pathologic conditions, we
used the terms low back injury, LBP, lumbar spine,

 pathology (spine), and sport. Search terms for exercise
specificity and physical adaptation were exercise, injury
prevention, outcome measures, physical/physiological ad-
aptation, rehabilitation, and training. We excluded studies
not written in English but did not place restrictions on study
design. A total of 1614 studies were retrieved from the
initial searches. Findings from studies were analyzed in the
context of any methodologic limitations. Key themes and
subthemes (eg, exercise objective grouping, subclassifica-
tion requirements) were identified to inform the definitions
of physical abilities, exercise categories, and physical
outcomes.
Phase 2
An expert project group was convened to review and
revise the exploratory panel findings. The group consisted
of 5 physiotherapists and 5 strength and conditioning
coaches holding national leadership positions within EIS
and regularly engaging in spinal training and rehabilitation
(S.S., A.W., and 8 nonauthors; Table 1). Independently,
they identified areas for discussion and review. Collective-
ly, they agreed on modifications to the definitions of
physical abilities, exercise categories, and physical out-
comes and formulated a draft classification informed by the
conceptual framework of the study. An example of an area
discussed and modified was the separation of work capacity
(WC) and strength into 2 distinct physical performance
variables.
Phase 3
A researcher (S.S.) presented the draft classification to all
EIS physiotherapists (n¼ 49) at a consensus forum and sent
it to key experts in the field for international expert review.
Data were analyzed to inform emerging themes and
subthemes that subsequently were integrated into a revised
classification. Examples of themes included understanding
and managing practitioner bias, clarity of presentation, and
agreed terminology/use of language.
Phase 4
Two of the investigators (S.S., A.W.) presented the
classification to members of the EIS technical lead
physiotherapy and strength and conditioning teams (n ¼
17) for discussion. The discussion focused on the strengths
of the framework and its potential application in elite sport.
Definition of Consensus
Consensus was defined as unanimous agreement and was
achieved at each phase. The classification was accepted by
unanimous agreement with minor amendments. We present
the definitive classification in the Results section.
RESULTS
Objective 1
Objective 1 was the identification of modifiable spinal
abilities that underpin optimal function during skilled
athletic performance. Spinal abilities were defined in 4
distinct categories: mobility, motor control, WC, and
strength.12,17�19 The extents to which each category
contributes to spinal neuromuscular control,6 the effect of
pain and pathologic conditions, and how exercise interven-
tions are used to influence targeted physical outcomes were
important to consider. The modifiable spinal abilities that
underpin optimal function during skilled athletic perfor-
mance are summarized in Figure 3 and defined in the
Appendix.
Mobility. Mobility was defined as freedom of movement
at spinal segments. It provides the basis for the
development of motor control20 and optimal spinal
function.21 Furthermore, the relationship between axial
mobility and athletic performance has been established.22,23
Deficits in spinal movement have been identified in
athletes with a history of LBP,24�26 for whom changes in
mobility are a product of the interaction between soft tissue
and articular dysfunction. It is plausible that abnormal
movement patterns or repetitive directional loading result in
the consistent absence of mechanical tension associated
with connective tissue remodeling and eventual loss of
muscle fiber length.27,28 Loss of mobility could also
represent an adaptive or maladaptive mechanism by which
the body attempts to achieve active stability and maintain a
level of function in the presence of pain, physical stress, or
failed motor control.29
A myriad of therapeutic interventions are used to
influence the neurophysical mechanisms associated with
loss of mobility (hypomobility), such as focal articular or
tissue restriction, pain, and altered muscular tone.30

 Exercise is frequently used to influence spinal motion, and
mobility exercises can also be performed in combination
with limb movement to augment tissue elongation
throughout a continuous myofascial line.31 Reliable
assessment of spinal motion has been established,32�35
and effective restoration of spinal range of motion after
flexibility training has been demonstrated in participants
with LBP.36,37 Support for including this component
within the classification is primarily based on clinical
concepts.
Motor Control. Maintenance of spinal integrity during
skilled movement tasks depends not only on muscular
capacity but also on the ability to process sensory input,
interpret the status of stability and motion, and establish
strategies to overcome predictable and unexpected
movement challenges.38 The spinal stability required
during athletic performance is task specific and governed
by the nature of the intended movement, the magnitude of
imposed load, and the perception of risk associated with the
activity.39 The central nervous system, therefore, determines
the requirements for stability and coordinates contraction of
deep and superficial core muscles using both feed-forward
and feedback control mechanisms.8,40 In the presence of
pain, the relationship between task demand for stability and
muscular recruitment becomes disrupted, resulting in
delayed trunk-muscle reflex responses and excessive outer-
core muscular activation.41�43 Classification systems have
been developed to establish the nature of adaptive motor
responses in the presence of pain and identify maladaptive
motor-control impairments contributing to spinal pain
disorders.44,45
Motor adaptation to pain has been demonstrated in
athletes with LBP46 and groin pain47 after recovery from a
recent occurrence of LBP48 and is observable in patients
with recurrent LBP during periods of remission.49 Further-
more, reflex response latencies can preexist within a
healthy athletic population, substantially increasing the
risk of sustaining an LSI.50 Evidence has suggested that
motor adaptation to pain can be influenced through
exercise-based intervention. Segmental-stabilization exer-
cises first described by Richardson and Jull51 focus on
retraining coordinated cocontraction of the deep trunk
muscles through simultaneous isometric cocontraction of
the transversus abdominis and multifidus in a static-neutral
spine position. Exercise has been shown to effectively
restore delayed or reduced activation of the transversus
abdominis52 and multifidus,53 with positive effects persist-
ing after cessation of training.54 Despite its scientific
foundation and widespread anecdotal support, impaired
feed-forward activation of local stabilization muscles in
patients with LBP has been challenged.55 Furthermore,
evidence also led researchers to question the ability to
better influence anticipatory muscle patterning after the
performance of segmental-stabilization exercises56 aligned
with the preferential effect on pain and dysfunction than
after any other form of active exercise.57
The ability to dissociate spinal and appendicular
movements provides a static platform for force absorption
and transference and is a product of mobility and
neuromuscular control of the limbs and maintenance of a
static-neutral lumbar position. During sporting activities
imparting high loads through the spine, forces need to be
distributed evenly to minimize loading of vulnerable tissues
in the spine.58,59 The inability to control a neutral position
increases the potential for tissue damage, especially during
repetitive-loading activities. Clinical tests reliably identify
the performance of dissociation tasks under both low- and
high-load conditions,60 with movement-control deficits
identified in patients with LBP.61 Hodges62 hypothesized
that failed load transfer during low-load conditions is
primarily due to inadequate motor-skill competence or
altered mechanical behavior associated with pain or the
threat of pain or injury. Failure under higher loads may be
attributed to other factors (eg, insufficient muscular
capacity), requiring detailed assessment to establish the
nature of the movement-control loss.

 During dynamic spinal movement, coordinated neuro-
muscular control of intersegmental articulation is provided
by precise coordination of the surrounding musculature.63
Proximal-to-distal segmental sequencing is critical for
performing skills that demand maximum speed to be
produced at the end of the distal segment in the kinetic
chain, such as kicking or throwing.22 Failed load transfer
during segmental motion results in aberrant motor patterns,
which hypothetically could result in tissue damage through
uneven load distribution and focal tissue stress.45,64
Conversely, changes in motor control in some subgroups
with LBP have been associated with a compromised ability
to coordinate spinal motion due to excessive aberrant
muscular cocontraction, resulting in an inability to perform
controlled segmental movements.65 Sequential segmental-
control exercises, such as dynamic pelvic tilting, are
intended to establish or retrain appropriate muscular
recruitment, coordinated dynamic motor control, and
proprioceptive awareness.66
Facilitation of skilled motor learning during rehabilita-
tion requires autonomous engagement in the learning
process.67 When the participant is motivated to learn a

 new motor skill, the new task needs to be clearly detailed
(eg, through instruction, demonstration).68 In addition, the
process must provide neuromuscular challenge through
progressive difficulty69 and variability,70 underpinned by
regular deliberate practice71 with appropriate knowledge of
results and performance related to the task.72
Work Capacity. Work capacity is synonymous with
local muscular endurance.73 This can be defined as the
ability to produce or tolerate variable intensities and
durations of work and contributes to the ability of an
athlete to perform efficiently in a given sport.73,74 Work
capacity is a training outcome and not a performance
outcome. The accumulation of training over many weeks
and months results in chronic local adaptation to muscle,
tendon, and metabolic biogenesis.75�82 This adaptation
increases the ability of the system to produce more work
during repeated efforts, allows the local musculature to
tolerate or demonstrate resilience to a larger training
volume of work,74 and supports the performance of work
closer to the intensity and duration required for sporting
performance.
By comparison, strength endurance has been described as
a performance-outcome test completed in isolation whereby
the goal is to achieve a specific amount of work at a given
intensity, such as maximum number of repetitions at 50%
of 1-repetition maximum or at a specific submaximal
load,83�85 with less emphasis placed on the physiologic
adaptation required for WC development. The American
College of Sports Medicine73 has also defined strength
endurance as high-intensity endurance. Therefore, strength
endurance can be used as a proxy measure of WC or as a
training variable within WC.73
The inability to meet mechanical-loading demands due to
insufficient neuromuscular capacity may result in loss of
optimal motor control and in biomechanical inefficiency.86
Trunk WC is underpinned by the ability to transfer, absorb,
or dissipate repeated or sustained submaximal forces
through appropriate strength endurance, providing a
platform for the development and performance of specific
strength qualities.
A reduction in trunk muscle endurance and changes in
endurance ratios have been identified in patients with a history

 of LBP,87�89 and insufficient abdominal muscular endurance
has been identified as a risk factor for injury recurrence.90
Furthermore, structural degeneration of the lumbar muscula-
ture in patients with LBP has been characterized by fatty
infiltration, muscular atrophy, and fiber-type modification.91,92
Static stabilization (pillar) exercises are frequently prescribed
to produce sufficient muscular activation to develop spinal-
endurance qualities during rehabilitation.16 Targeted exercise
has been shown to improve muscular strength,93 endurance,94
and cross-sectional area.95
Strength. Muscular strength can be defined as the ability
to produce force, and maximal strength is the largest force
the musculature can produce.96 The RFD has been defined
as the rate of rise of contractile force at the beginning of a
muscle action and is time dependent.97 The RFD from the
trunk musculature can either augment global external
power production (dynamic RFD) or protect the spine by
‘‘stiffening’’ against yielding forces (static RFD). The
production of force or torque and stiffness depends on
morphologic and neurologic factors in the neuromuscular

 system. Morphologic factors include cross-sectional area,
muscle-pennation angle, fascial length, and fiber type.98
Neurologic factors include motor-unit recruitment, firing
frequency, motor-unit synchronization, and intermuscular
coordination.99
For dynamic RFD and power, a growing body of
evidence100,101 has shown that athletes who produce the
greatest external power are the most successful in their
events. Peak RFD has a strong relationship with peak power
and has been used as a proxy measure of peak power.96
Watkins et al102 suggested that the trunk musculature assists
in stabilizing and controlling the load response for
maximum power during movements, such as the golf
swing. During a single movement, maximum power is the
greatest instantaneous power for producing maximum
velocity of movements, such as striking, kicking, jumping,
or throwing.103 All of these tasks require segmental
sequential coordination to augment external global power
output.
Static RFD or stiffness can be defined as the trunk’s
ability to resist deformation from yielding forces and
maintain spinal posture.104,105 Muscular trunk stiffness
requires contractile forces equal to the rate, direction, and
magnitude exerted against the trunk to minimize the
transmission of force to the spine. The morphologic and
neurologic qualities required for appropriate stiffness are
similar to those needed for power production.99,106,107 The
demand of the task can require the trunk to brace against a
rapid RFD under relatively low loads, biasing challenge
toward the neurologic system.108 By contrast, a high
imparted force also challenges the neurologic system but
requires the morphologic qualities of the trunk musculature

 to produce enough stiffness to protect the stability of the
spine.98,109
The association between trunk strength and the presence of
LBP remains unclear, with evidence to both support110�113 and
contest114,115 the relationship. Despite the suggestion that trunk
endurance provides greater prophylactic value,116 strength and
power are essential physical requirements for performance in
many sports and represent the final stages of exercise
progression for athletes during rehabilitation for LSI.18 In
addition, failing to redevelop sufficient trunk strength during
the rehabilitation process may compromise the ability to
maintain spinal integrity on return to sporting activity and
increase the risk of injury recurrence.
Objective 2
Objective 2 is the classification of spinal exercises
according to the objective of the exercise and intended
physical outcomes. The classification of exercises was
informed by empirical literature (eg, motor control, WC,
and strength) and the application of research within clinical
practice (eg, mobility development). Exercises were
classified according to the objective of the exercise and
the intended physical outcome. In addition, exercises were
subclassified by functionality as nonfunctional or functional
and by spinal displacement as static (maintenance of a
neutral spinal posture with no appreciable segmental
displacement) or dynamic (exercises involving appreciable
dynamic segmental movement).
Subclassification 1: Functionality. Functional exercises
have been described as a continuum of exercises that enable
athletes to effectively manipulate their body weight in all
planes of movement to achieve optimal athletic
performance.20 They are performed in weight-bearing
(standing, single-legged standing, squatting, lunging) or
sport-specific (multiple planes of motion involving multiple
joints) positions. By contrast, nonfunctional exercises are
typically performed in partial weight-bearing positions

621
 (sitting, kneeling, prone kneeling, lying) across a single
plane of motion with movement isolated to fewer joints.117
An advantage of nonfunctional spinal exercises is the
ability to influence mechanical loading within specifically
targeted muscle groups through the use of gravitational
force, lever length (by manipulating body position), and
superimposed load.118 Both functional and nonfunctional
spinal exercise prescriptions can be used to develop
effective interaction (dynamic correspondence119) among
physical abilities into sport-specific performance.
Subclassification 2: Spinal Displacement. During
athletic activity, spinal function provides a static platform
for force absorption and transference or a dynamic
contribution to whole-body motion. The need for these
abilities depends on the movement demands of the sport,
which frequently require both components. During
activities that involve high-loading characteristics, the
central nervous system uses stiffening strategies by
cocontracting the antagonist trunk muscles with little or
no appreciable segmental displacement. In contrast, during
tasks requiring appreciable dynamic segmental movement,
the central nervous system controls this motion through the
precision of timing and pattern of muscle activity.12 The
ability to dissociate spinal and appendicular motions and
perform sequential segmental spinal movement represent 2
discrete skill-based movement competencies.

 Spinal-Exercise Classification. The definitive spinal
exercise classification (SEC) is summarized in Figure 4.
Definitions of each exercise objective and examples of
exercises related to each intended physical outcome are
displayed in Table 2 and Figures 5 through 11. Exercises
can be delineated further by plane of motion or globally
targeted muscular contraction (eg, sagittal-plane
movement, anterior-chain muscular activation).118
DISCUSSION
Confusion has existed about CS, how it is trained, and its
application to functional performance.10 In addition, the
most effective exercises for the treatment of LBP remain
largely unknown, and researchers have been unable to
direct a specific exercise prescription to patients in a given
pathologic subgroup. During recent years, investigators
have highlighted the complex interactions among anatom-
ical, neurophysiological, and psychosocial factors influenc-
ing spinal control. Not synthesizing contemporary evidence
can lead to reductionist opinion and unidimensional
paradigms of exercise prescription when, in reality, the
spine functions across a vast spectrum of movement
demands, demonstrating complex interactions among many
different modifiable physical abilities.
We used qualitative consensus methods for systemati-
cally defining the classification system to ensure accept-
ability to elite sport practitioners. The 4 phases worked well
to ensure challenges to identified themes and subthemes,
with conclusions drawn from individuals experienced in
sport at the elite level. The definitive SEC consolidates
approaches to spinal exercise to develop a practical,
conceptual representation of rehabilitation options applica-
ble within a diverse spectrum of musculoskeletal practice.
Furthermore, the classification supports multidisciplinary
team integration within the rehabilitation process, demon-
strating validity for use by strength and conditioning
professionals as the athlete transitions toward perfor-
mance-focused training after injury.
The intention of the SEC is to encourage detailed clinical
reasoning, with practitioners identifying specific physical
dysfunction or dysfunctions and considering exercise
prescription within the context of a clinical diagnosis or
the prevailing circumstances (eg, sport-specific perfor-

623
 mance targets). When determined, targeted exercise
objectives define the nature of the exercise prescription
required to deliver an intended physical outcome. For
practitioners to effectively use the SEC, spinal abilities
need to be identified using outcome measures with
established measurement properties. Moreover, athletes
frequently compensate for suboptimal abilities in various
aspects of physical performance. When the process of
athlete evaluation identifies multidimensional physical
dysfunction, restoration of mobility and fundamental motor
control must precede the development of WC and strength.
The SEC provides a platform for further research. Future
studies are required to establish patterns of physical dysfunc-
tion within specific pathologic subgroups, evaluate the efficacy
of exercise prescription in the development of specific physical
performance abilities, and assess the effect of targeted exercise
within sporting populations that have pathologic conditions.
The ability to exhibit a wide breadth of physical abilities
enhances performance and supports the capacity to adapt to the
variable nature of stress during sporting activity, contributing
to the foundation of injury prevention.120
The strengths of our study were the attempts to define a
common language; integrate a breadth of literature; and
comprehensively evolve and incorporate, rather than
replace or discredit, existing theoretical frameworks
extrapolated from a rapidly expanding knowledge base.
The key limitation of our study was the predominantly
national focus of the consensus process, although interna-
tional experts were included at key stages.
CONCLUSIONS
Maintenance of spinal integrity during skilled athletic
performance requires precise neuromuscular control to
balance task demands for stability and motion. Economy
of motion is a function of discrete, interdependent physical
abilities. When investigating intrinsic contributions to spinal
injury, reductionist approaches may not accurately identify
the factors associated with causality and predisposition.
Furthermore, comprehensive restoration of physical abilities
during rehabilitation is fundamental in attaining optimal
athletic performance and mitigating injury risk on return to
sporting activity. Exercise specificity forms the basis of
targeted adaptation, in which the intended physical outcome
must dictate the nature of the exercise prescription. The SEC
contextualizes spinal function and provides a basis for
clinical reasoning and targeted exercise selection in the
prevention and management of spinal injuries in sport.
