Poor sleep is associated with CSF
biomarkers of amyloid pathology in
cognitively normal adults
ABSTRACT
Objective: To determine the relationship between sleep quality and CSF markers of Alzheimer dis-
ease (AD) pathology in late midlife.
Methods: We investigated the relationship between sleep quality and CSF AD biomarkers in
a cohort enriched for parental history of sporadic AD, the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer’s
Prevention. A total of 101 participants (mean age 62.9 6 6.2 years, 65.3% female) completed
sleep assessments and CSF collection and were cognitively normal. Sleep quality was measured
with the Medical Outcomes Study Sleep Scale. CSF was assayed for biomarkers of amyloid
metabolism and plaques (b-amyloid 42 [Ab42]), tau pathology (phosphorylated tau [p-tau]
181), neuronal/axonal degeneration (total tau [t-tau], neurofilament light [NFL]), neuroinflammation/
astroglial activation (monocyte chemoattractant protein–1 [MCP-1], chitinase-3-like protein 1 [YKL-
40]), and synaptic dysfunction/degeneration (neurogranin). To adjust for individual differences in total
amyloid production, Ab42 was expressed relative to Ab40. To assess cumulative pathology, CSF
biomarkers were expressed in ratio to Ab42. Relationships among sleep scores and CSF biomarkers
were assessed with multiple regression, controlling for age, sex, time between sleep and CSF meas-
urements, and CSF assay batch.
Results: Worse subjective sleep quality, more sleep problems, and daytime somnolence were
associated with greater AD pathology, indicated by lower CSF Ab42/Ab40 and higher t-tau/
Ab42, p-tau/Ab42, MCP-1/Ab42, and YKL-40/Ab42. There were no significant associations
between sleep and NFL or neurogranin.
Conclusions: Self-report of poor sleep was associated with greater AD-related pathology in cog-
nitively healthy adults at risk for AD. Effective strategies exist for improving sleep; therefore
sleep health may be a tractable target for early intervention to attenuate AD pathogenesis.

To delay or prevent dementia due to Alzheimer disease (AD), it is critical to identify modifiable
risk factors. Sleep quality is a promising target for intervention during the preclinical phase of
AD, when pathogenesis has begun but cognition is still intact.1 Sleep is associated with AD
brain pathophysiology, including amyloid mis-metabolism and deposition, tau hyperphosphor-
ylation and aggregation, and neuronal and synaptic dysfunction and degeneration. We pre-
viously found that self-report of poor sleep was associated with greater brain amyloid burden, as
measured by PET with Pittsburgh compound B (PiB).2 In young men, sleep deprivation
diminished the diurnal fluctuation of CSF amyloid levels.3 In rodent models of AD, sleep
restriction alters amyloid metabolism and tau phosphorylation,4–6 and tau-deficient mice show

 disturbed sleep architecture.7 Maintenance of
axons8 and synapses occurs during sleep,9 and
sleep loss elevates inflammation and microglial
activation.10
Preclinical AD brain pathology can be de-
tected via CSF biomarkers; however, little is
known of their relationship with sleep. CSF
b-amyloid 42 (Ab42, a marker of amyloid
deposition) may be associated with sleep-
disordered breathing11 and sleep fragmenta-
tion.12 However, less is known about other
markers of AD pathophysiology. Further-
more, CSF biomarkers combined in ratios
have superior diagnostic and prognostic power
compared to single biomarkers.13,14 Therefore we
examined the relationship between self-reported
sleep and CSF biomarkers of amyloid deposition
and plaque formation (Ab42), tau phosphoryla-
tion state and tau pathology (phosphorylated tau
[p-tau]), axonal degeneration (total tau [t-tau],
neurofilament light [NFL]), neuroinflammation
(monocyte chemoattractant protein–1 [MCP-
1], chitinase-3-like protein 1 [YKL-40]), and
synaptic dysfunction/degeneration (neurogra-
nin) in cognitively healthy adults in late middle
age.
METHODS Participants and study design. Participants
were drawn from a longitudinal cohort enriched with parental
history of AD, the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer’s Prevention
(WRAP).15 Beginning in 2001, 1,5001 WRAP participants were
recruited from the community via advertisements and word of
mouth and were aged 40–65 years at study entry. Participants
underwent extensive cognitive testing and medical history assess-
ment at baseline, 4 years later, and every 2 years subsequently at
the University of Wisconsin–Madison. Beginning in 2010, par-
ticipants were sequentially recruited by letter and telephone into
substudies that included CSF collection. Recruitment into CSF
substudies was based on temporal proximity to recent or
upcoming evaluations for the parent study (average interval was
0.84 years), as well as self-reported interest in substudies that were
advertised at WRAP participant events. All WRAP participants
were included in the present analysis who had assayed CSF
samples, completed sleep questionnaires, and were cognitively
normal. When CSF was available from multiple time points, the
data from the CSF sample collected closest to the sleep ques-
tionnaire were used.
Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient
consents. The study was approved by the University of

CSF collection and quantification. CSF was collected in the
morning (mean 10:22 AM 6 1 hour 12 minutes SD) following
a 12-hour fast. Lumbar puncture was performed with a Sprotte
25- or 24-gauge spinal needle at L3/4 or L4/5, using gentle
extraction into polypropylene syringes. Approximately 22 mL of
CSF was gently mixed to remove gradient effects and centrifuged
at 2,000 g for 10 minutes. A total of 0.5 mL aliquots of super-
natants was frozen in polypropylene tubes and stored at 2808C.
The samples were sent in 2 batches to the University of Goth-
enburg in Sweden to be assayed. For the Ab42/Ab40 ratio, CSF
Ab42 and Ab40 were measured by electrochemiluminescence
using an Ab triplex assay (MSD Human Ab peptide Ultra-
Sensitive Kit, Meso Scale Discovery, Gaithersburg, MD). For

 all other ratios, CSF Ab42 was quantified with a sandwich
ELISA, as were t-tau and p-tau181 (INNOTEST b-amyloid1-
42, hTAU-Ag, and phospho-tau[181P], respectively; Fujirebio
Europe, Ghent, Belgium). Sandwich ELISAs were also used to
assay CSF YKL-40 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) and NFL
(NF-light ELISA kit, UmanDiagnostics AB, Umeå, Sweden).
MCP-1 was measured using the Meso Scale Discovery technique
(MSD Human MCP-1; Meso Scale Discovery). All assays were
conducted by board-certified laboratory technicians blinded to
participant clinical characteristics. Assays were completed in
a single round of analyses using one batch of reagents, yielding
intra-assay coefficients of variation below 10%.
CSF measures were selected for this analysis based on their
ability to predict subsequent amyloid accumulation, as we have
reported previously in an overlapping sample.13 For statistical
analyses, Ab42 was expressed in ratio to Ab40 (the more abun-
dant, nontoxic fragment), to assess the pathologic species (Ab42)
while accounting for individual differences in amyloid produc-
tion. T-tau, p-tau181, NFL, MCP-1, YKL-40, and neurogranin
were expressed in ratios to Ab42 to reflect coincident pathologies
and because these ratios have better diagnostic and prognostic
power than each species expressed alone.13,14 CSF Ab42 decreases
as plaque burden increases, whereas the other CSF markers ana-
lyzed are elevated when pathology is greater. Therefore lower
Ab42 and Ab42/Ab40 indicate greater pathology, while ratios
of other CSF markers to Ab42 indicate greater pathology when
they are elevated.13
Sleep assessment. Sleep was assessed with the Medical Out-
comes Study (MOS) Sleep Scale and the Epworth Sleepiness
Scale (ESS). The MOS Sleep Scale was selected because it assesses
multiple sleep domains with low participant burden and good
internal consistency.16 It gives scores in 6 sleep domains, derived
from 12 questions (table 1). Responses were elicited for the last 4
weeks using a 6-point scale, then converted to a 0–100 scale
before being summed to give sleep scores. Primary analyses
focused on scores we previously found to be associated with brain
amyloid burden measured by PiB-PET: sleep adequacy, somno-
lence, and sleep problems index.2 Secondary analyses of symp-
toms of sleep-disordered breathing (snoring and waking short of
breath) were conducted to better understand the relationship
between sleep and CSF biomarkers. Higher scores indicate more
of the construct being measured, such that worse sleep is reflected
by lower sleep adequacy and higher somnolence and sleep
problems index. The ESS was selected because it is a widely used
tool in clinical sleep research for assessing daytime sleepiness and
sleep propensity, with good internal validity and test–retest reli-
ability.17 Participants use a 4-point scale to rate their likelihood of
dozing off in 8 common situations, with higher scores indicating
greater sleepiness (range 0–24).
APOE, family history, and cognitive assessment. Partici-
pants were classified as carriers or noncarriers of one or more
APOE e4 alleles, determined by standard PCR techniques. Pos-
itive parental history of AD was defined as having one or both
parents with AD as determined by a validated interview18 or
autopsy-confirmed or probable AD as outlined by research cri-
teria.19 Detailed medical history and phone interviews were
conducted to confirm family history negative participants. Global
cognitive function was assessed with the Mini-Mental State
Examination,20 and learning and memory with the Rey Auditory
Verbal Learning Test.21 Clinical diagnosis of cognitively normal
was determined by consensus of a multidisciplinary panel, based
on physical examination, medical and social history, neuro-
psychological testing, and self-reports and informant reports of
cognitive and functional status.
Statistical analysis. Separate multiple regression models were
run for each combination of CSF and sleep measures, with CSF
as the dependent variable and sleep as the independent variable,

 with covariates sex, age at CSF sample, CSF assay batch, and time
between CSF sample and sleep assessment (all mean centered). Due
to missing data, the number of participants included in each anal-
ysis ranged from 94 to 101. Ratios of CSF values to Ab42 were log-
transformed to achieve normal distributions. Casewise diagnostics
did not reveal any outliers (63 SD from the mean) that
warranted removal, based on influence (Cook distance ,0.039)
or leverage (DFBETA ,0.197). To account for multiple
comparisons, a false discovery rate approach was used, which
controls error while preserving power by adjusting the p value
criterion for significance based on the number of tests
performed.22 All analyses were conducted with IBM SPSS 23
(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).
RESULTS A total of 101 members of the WRAP
cohort met criteria for inclusion (completed CSF as-
says, MOS Sleep Scale, and ESS). Participant charac-
teristics are summarized in table 2. The sample was in
late midlife (age 63.76 6 6.18 years at time of sleep
questionnaires), cognitively normal, and enriched
with AD risk (73.3% with family history of AD,
29.7% APOE e41).
Regression results are summarized in table 3 and
significant relationships between CSF biomarkers and
sleep scores are plotted in the figure. Lower Ab42/
Ab40 was associated with lower sleep adequacy
(figure, A), indicating that less adequate sleep was
associated with greater amyloid pathology. Ab42/
Ab40 was not significantly associated with somno-
lence, sleep problems index, or ESS. Elevated NFL/
Ab42 was associated with greater somnolence (figure,
B). There was no significant relationship between
NFL/Ab42 and the other sleep measures examined
here. T-tau/Ab42 and p-tau/Ab42 were significantly
higher with lower sleep adequacy and greater somno-
lence and sleep problems index (figure, C–H). Nei-
ther t-tau/Ab42 nor p-tau/Ab42 was related to ESS.
Higher YKL-40/Ab42 was associated with lower
sleep adequacy and greater sleep problems index
(figure, I and J). There was no significant relationship
between YKL-40/Ab42 and daytime sleepiness (som-
nolence or ESS). Higher MCP-1/Ab42 was associ-
ated with greater somnolence (figure, K) but no other
sleep measures. Neurogranin/Ab42 was not associated
with any of the sleep measures. Greater tau was asso-
ciated with lower sleep adequacy. There were no other
significant relationships between sleep and CSF bio-
markers expressed alone (table e-1 at Neurology.org).
There were no significant interactions with APOE e4
status or age. There was no significant association
between CSF biomarkers and self-report of sleep-
disordered breathing symptoms or sleep duration.
Depression, body mass index (BMI), education, car-
diovascular disease, and sleep-affecting medications
(table e-2) did not explain any additional variance in
CSF biomarkers (table e-3), except for BMI with log
(NFL/Ab42). The relationship between somnolence
and log(NFL/Ab42) remained statistically significant

DISCUSSION Self-report of less adequate sleep,
greater daytime sleepiness, and more sleep problems
were associated with CSF biomarkers of amyloid
deposition in combination with tau pathology, axonal
degeneration, and neuroinflammation.
We have previously shown that self-report of poor
sleep was associated with greater brain amyloid bur-
den, measured with PiB-PET.2 The CSF results re-
ported here mirror the PiB-PET findings, and reveal
further relationships between sleep and CSF bio-
markers of cumulative AD pathology. CSF bio-
markers give complimentary information to amyloid
PET scans. First, abnormalities may become apparent
in CSF before PET.23 Second, CSF can be collected
and assayed using widely available methods, whereas
PET remains more expensive and requires substantial
infrastructure. Finally, whereas a PET scan assesses
only a single form of pathology, CSF can be assayed
for multiple pathologic species simultaneously.
CSF biomarker ratios indexing multiple patholo-
gies capture the temporal relationship between
pathologies, which is a better indicator of disease stage
than absolute levels of individual pathologies because
AD is a progressive and multifactorial neurodegener-
ative disease.1 Multipathology ratios have superior
predictive power for development of neuropathologic
features of AD13 and appear to provide superior diag-
nostic markers of AD.14 Our findings confirm their
utility in the context of sleep, given that multipathol-
ogy biomarkers were associated with more sleep do-
mains than single-pathology markers. In particular,
the only single-pathology markers associated with
sleep were amyloid and tau, which were associated
with lower sleep adequacy. Yet when expressed in
ratio to each other, they were also associated with
daytime somnolence and sleep problems. The value
1/Ab42 was associated with sleep scores in a similar
but not identical pattern to the ratios, confirming that
the ratios capture information that is different from
single markers and that our results were not driven by
Ab42 in the denominator. This is further supported
by effect sizes, which were greater for CSF ratios than
1/Ab42.
There is evidence that sleep affects AD pathology
through multiple pathways. Sleep disturbance may
promote amyloid plaque formation through increased
amyloid production or reduced amyloid clearance.
Orexin, an important regulator of the sleep–wake
cycle, has been shown to drive production and
deposition of Ab in transgenic mice, possibly by
promoting wakefulness.3 It has also been shown in
mice that clearance of exogenous amyloid is greater
during sleep, as a result of increased glymphatic flow.4
Thus sleep disruption could promote a buildup of
soluble amyloid, leading to aggregation into plaques.
These hypotheses remain to be tested in humans.
Interestingly, CSF biomarkers of AD pathology
were associated with daytime sleepiness indexed
by MOS somnolence but not ESS. We previously
observed the same distinction with PET-measured
amyloid burden.2 The difference could be due to
the nature of the daytime sleepiness: ESS indexes
irresistible sleepiness (falling asleep in inappropriate
situations such as driving) whereas somnolence may
index resistible sleepiness (feeling drowsy and delib-
erate napping). Orexin, a wake promoter, is ele-
vated in patients with mild cognitive impairment
and associated with tau pathology.24 It is possible
that the sleep disturbance reported here in conjunc-
tion with resistible, but not irresistible, sleepiness
reflects an abnormal upregulation of the orexin
system.
YKL-40 and MCP-1 in CSF are indicative of neu-
roinflammation and astroglial activation associated
with amyloid plaques, with diagnostic and prognostic
utility for AD.25–27 Sleep restriction broadly promotes
proinflammatory cytokines, possibly by disrupting
diurnal fluctuations of growth and stress hormone
release, and their modulation by slow-wave sleep.10
Both neurotoxic and neuroprotective roles have been
proposed for YKL-40 and MCP-1 during early stages
of amyloid plaque formation27 and further study is
required to interpret their relationship with poor
sleep.
Degeneration of synapses is an early feature of AD
indexed by neurogranin, a postsynaptic protein with
diagnostic utility for AD.28 Maintenance of mem-
branes and synapses is upregulated during sleep8,9;
therefore we hypothesized that sleep disturbance would
increase synaptic injury. However, we found no rela-
tionship between neurogranin and sleep. Synaptic
degeneration in AD may be secondary to amyloid
and tau pathology29; therefore it may be that a relation-
ship between synaptic injury and sleep is not yet
detectable in this relatively young healthy cohort.
We did not find a relationship between CSF bio-
markers and symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea

Association of CSF biomarkers with sleep scores
(A–K) Regression results and 95% confidence intervals are plotted for the significant relationships between CSF biomarkers and sleep scores. CSF
measures are adjusted for age, sex, CSF batch, and time between CSF sample and sleep questionnaire. Higher sleep scores indicate more of the construct
being measured. Ab 5 b-amyloid; MCP-1 5 monocyte chemoattractant protein–1; NFL 5 neurofilament light; p-tau 5 phosphorylated tau; t-tau 5 total tau;

 (OSA). This lack of relationship is surprising, given
consistent findings that OSA is a risk factor for
dementia, possibly promoting AD pathogenesis
via sleep fragmentation30 or hypoxia.31 It is possible,
however, that OSA impedes the transfer of proteins
into the CSF, altering the relationship between CSF
concentrations and CNS pathology in patients with
OSA.11 Alternatively, OSA severity in this sample
may have been too low to detect a relationship with
CSF, as on average participants rated their snoring
frequency as low. Sleep-disordered breathing often
goes undetected by patients, and subjective reports
are not reliable in detecting sleep apnea. Neither
snoring nor waking short of breath was significantly
correlated with sleep adequacy, somnolence, ESS,
or each other. This fits with literature showing that
snoring and daytime sleepiness add distinct infor-
mation to predict SDB.32 Given that we did not
directly test for OSA, further studies measuring
sleep and breathing are needed to understand the
contribution of sleep-disordered breathing to the
relationship between poor sleep and CSF bio-
markers of AD.
Sleep disturbances may have an effect on AD
pathology, but on the other hand, AD pathology
may affect sleep quality. Animal models show that
increasing amyloid plaque burden is accompanied
by increasingly fragmented sleep, which is rescued
by elimination of Ab deposits in the mouse brain
by active immunization.33 In humans, there is evi-
dence that amyloid plaques disrupt slow-wave sleep,
impairing memory consolidation.34 Slow-wave sleep
is important for feeling refreshed35; therefore our
finding that perceptions of inadequate sleep were
related to more AD pathology could reflect an
inability to obtain sufficient slow-wave sleep as
a result of amyloid plaques or possibly elevated pres-
ence of oligomeric forms of Ab.
Limitations of this study include the cross-
sectional design and use of subjective sleep measures.
There is evidence of bidirectional relationships
between sleep and amyloid3,33 that cannot be disen-
tangled by this cross-sectional study design. Longitu-
dinal follow-up within individuals will be important
to determine the course of sleep and brain pathology
in preclinical AD. Variability in CSF collection time
may have contributed some unaccounted for variance
in amyloid levels, and mean collection time was 10:22
AM, close to a 10 AM nadir in CSF amyloid reported
by one study.36 However, the diurnal fluctuation was
smaller in older adults, and we found no correlation
between CSF collection time and amyloid levels.
This study measured sleep through self-report.
Objective sleep measures such as actigraphy and poly-
somnography would clarify the contribution of sleeping
brain activity, breathing, and sleep-wake rhythmicity to
AD pathogenesis. However, the investigation of self-
reported sleep quality is itself an important clinical
question. There is substantial interindividual variability
in the effect of sleep disturbance on cognitive and phys-
iologic functioning.37 Furthermore, sleep health is mul-
tidimensional,38 and current objective techniques (e.g.,
polysomnography and actigraphy) do not fully capture
“adequate” sleep.39 Thus self-report provides important
complementary information on functional outcomes
and perceptions.
These results add to a growing body of evidence
linking sleep quality with AD neuropathology. Our
findings demonstrate that the relationship between
sleep and AD pathology is present in late midlife in
the absence of cognitive impairment. Furthermore,
we show that the relationship is detectable using
self-report and CSF biomarkers, tools that are rela-
tively inexpensive and accessible, making them
appealing for further research in large cohorts and
clinical trials. ESS is a simple and widely used mea-
sure of sleep dysfunction in clinical sleep research.
Given the lack of associations shown here with
CSF, and previously with PET biomarkers of AD,2
we recommend that other sleep measures be included
in studies of the relationship between sleep and AD.
Findings were not altered by race, education, depres-
sive symptoms, BMI, or use of sleep medications.
Sleep may be a modifiable risk factor for AD dur-
ing the earliest stages of the disease, before dementia
symptoms appear. Although the effect sizes reported
here are modest, it is estimated that delaying AD
onset by a mere 5 years would reduce AD cases by
5.7 million and save $367 billion in health care
spending in the United States.40 Many effective phar-
maceuticals, devices, and behavioral interventions are
already available in the clinic for improving sleep
quality. Follow-up studies are needed to identify the
aspects of sleep that are most amenable to modifica-
tion and most effective in affecting AD pathology, to
ultimately delay AD or diminish AD symptoms.
