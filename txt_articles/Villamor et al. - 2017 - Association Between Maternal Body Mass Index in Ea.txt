IMPORTANCE Maternal overweight and obesity are associated with increased risks of preterm
delivery, asphyxia-related neonatal complications, and congenital malformations, which in
turn are associated with increased risks of cerebral palsy. It is uncertain whether risk of
cerebral palsy in offspring increases with maternal overweight and obesity severity and what
could be possible mechanisms.
OBJECTIVE To study the associations between early pregnancy body mass index (BMI)
and rates of cerebral palsy by gestational age and to identify potential mediators
of these associations.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Population-based retrospective cohort study of women
with singleton children born in Sweden from 1997 through 2011. Using national registries,
children were followed for a cerebral palsy diagnosis through 2012.
EXPOSURES Early pregnancy BMI.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Incidence rates of cerebral palsy and hazard ratios (HRs)
with 95% CIs, adjusted for maternal age, country of origin, education level, cohabitation with
a partner, height, smoking during pregnancy, and year of delivery.
RESULTS Of 1 423 929 children included (mean gestational age, 39.8 weeks [SD, 1.8];
51.4% male), 3029 were diagnosed with cerebral palsy over a median 7.8 years of follow-up
(risk, 2.13 per 1000 live births; rate, 2.63/10 000 child-years). The percentages of mothers
in BMI categories were 2.4% at BMI less than 18.5 (underweight), 61.8% at BMI of 18.5
to 24.9 (normal weight), 24.8% at BMI of 25 to 29.9 (overweight), 7.8% at BMI of 30 to 34.9
(obesity grade 1), 2.4% at BMI of 35 to 39.9 (obesity grade 2), and 0.8% at BMI 40 or greater
(obesity grade 3). The number of cerebral palsy cases in each BMI category was 64, 1487, 728,
239, 88, and 38; and the rates per 10 000 child-years were 2.58, 2.35, 2.92, 3.15, 4.00, and
5.19, respectively. Compared with children of normal-weight mothers, adjusted HR of cerebral
palsy were 1.22 (95% CI, 1.11-1.33) for overweight, 1.28 (95% CI, 1.11-1.47) for obesity grade 1,
1.54 (95% CI, 1.24, 1.93) for obesity grade 2, and 2.02 (95% CI, 1.46-2.79) for obesity grade 3.
Results were statistically significant for children born at full term, who comprised 71% of all
children with cerebral palsy, but not for preterm infants. An estimated 45% of the association
between maternal BMI and rates of cerebral palsy in full-term children was mediated through
asphyxia-related neonatal morbidity.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among Swedish women with singleton children, maternal
overweight and obesity were significantly associated with the rate of cerebral palsy.
The association was limited to children born at full term and was partly mediated
through asphyxia-related neonatal complications.

C
erebral palsy is the most common pediatric motor
disability. In the United States, the estimated preva-
lence by age 8 years was 3.1 per 1000 live births in
2008,1 and in Sweden, 2.2 per 1000 live births in 2006.2
Despite advances in obstetric and neonatal care, cerebral
palsy prevalence increased from 1998 through 2006 in
children born at full term.2 Cerebral palsy constitutes a sig-
nificant lifetime disability for children and their families,
and is associated with chronic diseases3 and a shortened
life expectancy.4
Few preventable factors are known to affect the risk of
cerebral palsy. Although preterm delivery is a risk factor,
most children with cerebral palsy are born at full term and
the causes of cerebral palsy in this group remain largely
unknown.5 Birth asphyxia has been implicated, but its contri-
bution relative to other perinatal factors is controversial.5
Maternal obesity is a major prenatal risk factor for obstet-
ric complications,6 preterm delivery,7 asphyxia-related neo-
natal morbidities,8 and possibly cognitive and behavioral de-
velopmental disabilities in children.9 An association between
high maternal body mass index (BMI) and cerebral palsy has
been suggested10-14 but never addressed in a nationwide in-
vestigation with sufficiently large numbers of cases to allow
exploration of possible causal pathways.
The aims of this population-based study were to eluci-
date the association between maternal overweight and obe-
sity on the incidence of cerebral palsy, and to examine whether
an association could be mediated by overweight or obesity–
related pregnancy or neonatal complications.
Methods
Study Design
The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee at
Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden. The need for par-
ticipants’consent was waived because the data were anony-
mized. This population-based retrospective cohort study
included live singleton births at 22 or more completed gesta-
tional weeks, recorded in the Swedish Medical Birth Register
from 1997 through 2011. Using the person-unique national
registration numbers of mothers and children,15 the Medical
Birth Register was cross-linked with the National Patient,
Cause of Death, Total Population, and Education Registers.
The Medical Birth Register includes data on more than
98% of all births in Sweden.16 Information on prenatal,
obstetric, and neonatal care is prospectively recorded on
standardized forms that are forwarded to the registry after
the mother and infant are discharged from the hospital.16 The
National Patient Register includes diagnostic information on
hospital admissions since 1987 and hospital out-patient care
from 2001.17,18 The Cause of Death Register includes informa-
tion on all deaths in Sweden.19 Diagnoses and causes of death
are coded according to the Swedish version of the Interna-
tional Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) since
1997. The Total Population Register contains information on
country of birth.20 The Education Register records the high-
est level of education and is updated yearly.21
Exposure
Maternal BMI (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by
height in meters squared) in early pregnancy was calculated
from self-reported height and weight measured in light
clothing at the first prenatal visit, which occurs within the
first 14 weeks of gestation for 90% of pregnant women.16
The correlation of height values between consecutive preg-
nancies by the same mother is 0.98.22 Hence, to reduce
measurement error, we computed the median height across
pregnancies for multiparous women.23 Maternal BMI was
classified according to the World Health Organization as
underweight (<18.5), normal weight (18.5-24.9), overweight
(25.0-29.9), obesity grade 1 (30.0-34.9), obesity grade 2
(35.0-39.9), or obesity grade 3 (≥40.0).24 We also considered
BMI as a continuous exposure.
Covariates
Maternal age at delivery was calculated as date of delivery
minus mother’
s birth date. Parity was defined as the number
of births of each mother. Information on whether the mother
cohabited with the child’
s father, a socioeconomic status
indicator, was obtained at the first prenatal visit. Mothers
were asked about smoking at the first prenatal visit and at 30
to 32 gestational weeks. Those who reported smoking at
either visit were classified as smokers, whereas mothers who
only stated that they were nonsmokers were classified as
nonsmokers. This approach has been validated using coti-
nine markers.25 Mothers’country of birth and educational
level were also considered.
AllwomeninSwedenareofferedultrasounddatingofpreg-
nancy no later than early in the second trimester, and 95%
accept.26 Gestational age in completed weeks was estimated
by early second trimester ultrasound dating in 87.7%, the date
of the last menstrual period in 7.4%, and postnatal assess-
ment in 4.9%. The length of gestation was categorized as full
term (≥37 weeks), moderately preterm (32-36 weeks), very pre-
term (28-31 weeks), or extremely preterm (22-27 weeks). We
examined the association of maternal BMI with cerebral palsy
stratified by categories of gestational length.
We considered known consequences of maternal obesity
as potential mediators of the association between early preg-
nancy BMI and cerebral palsy, including mode of delivery,
Key Points
Question Is maternal obesity in early pregnancy associated
with incidence of cerebral palsy in the offspring regardless
of gestational age at delivery?
Findings In this nationwide cohort study of 1.4 million singleton
Swedish children, maternal overweight and obesity were
statistically significantly associated with increased rates of cerebral
palsy. The association was restricted to children born at full term
and partly mediated through asphyxia-related neonatal
complications.
Meaning Maternal obesity was associated with an increased rate
of cerebral palsy in the offspring, partly mediated by birth asphyxia.

traumatic delivery, macrosomia (birth weight ≥4000 g), neo-
natal infections and asphyxia-related neonatal morbidities
(both within 28 days after birth), low Apgar score (<7) at 5
minutes, and congenital malformations. Categorization of
covariates is provided in Table 1 and Table 2 and ICD-10 codes
for diseases in mothers and children are provided in eTable 1
in the Supplement.
Outcomes
Information on cerebral palsy was based on diagnostic codes
from the National Patient Register (ICD-10 code G80), diag-
nosed from 1997 through 2012. The quality of cerebral palsy di-
agnoses and registration in Sweden is high. About 40% of in-
cluded cases are from country regions with well-established
population-based cerebral palsy registries (Western Sweden
since 1954 and South of Sweden since 1990). In these regis-
tries, all reported cases are systematically validated through
medical record review, physical examination, or both by pedi-
atric neurologists who are experts on cerebral palsy. Children
from other regions are typically diagnosed by child neurolo-
gists, and a few by pediatricians experienced in child neurol-
ogy. During the study period, children with cerebral palsy were
entered in the Swedish National Quality Registry, which in-
cludes guidelines for diagnosis and classification.
The primary outcome was cerebral palsy of any type. We
also considered the associations between early pregnancy BMI
and subtypes of cerebral palsy (ICD-10 codes in eTable 1 in the
Supplement).
Statistical Analysis
Because the time of follow-up differed between participants,
we estimated person-time incidence rates of cerebral palsy.
Children were followed from birth to age at diagnosis of cere-
bral palsy, death, or end of follow-up (December 31, 2012),
whichever came first. We first compared unadjusted rates be-
tween categories of maternal characteristics at baseline, preg-
nancy complications, and offspring diagnoses. Because the
probabilityofbeingdiagnosedwithcerebralpalsychangeswith
age, we calculated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs with the
use of Cox proportional hazards models in which the out-
come was age at first diagnosis of cerebral palsy. Next, we es-
timated rates of cerebral palsy in each BMI category. Ad-
justed HRs were obtained from multivariable Cox models with
covariates including maternal age, country of origin, educa-
tionlevel,cohabitationwithpartner,height,smoking,andyear
of delivery. For the computation of 95% CIs, we specified the
robust sandwich estimate of the covariance matrix in all Cox
models to account for the correlation of measures among mul-
tiparous women. Tests for linear trend were conducted by in-
troducing a variable representing ordinal categories of BMI as
a continuous predictor into the models. To assess potential
nonlinear associations between BMI and cerebral palsy inci-
dence, we estimated HRs for cerebral palsy in 13 fine BMI cat-
egories (eFigure 1A in the Supplement). In addition, we per-
formed Cox regression with linear and nonlinear terms for BMI
as a continuous predictor. Nonlinear terms were derived from
restricted cubic spline models27 with 3 to 9 knots (eFigure 1B
in the Supplement). We used a stepwise algorithm to test the
fit of the nonlinear (spline) terms. None of these terms of-
feredasignificantlybetterfitthanthelineartermforBMIalone
in any of the models tested. Hence, we estimated the HR per
unit BMI assuming that the association with cerebral palsy was
linear (eFigure 1C in the Supplement). Because the validity of
a cerebral palsy diagnosis may differ between young infants
and older children, we conducted supplemental analyses af-
ter excluding infant deaths and infants diagnosed with cere-
bral palsy before 1 year of age.
Because maternal BMI is associated with risk of infant
mortality28 and asphyxia-related morbidity8 in infants born at
full term, we decided a priori to estimate rates of cerebral palsy
by BMI categories separately for full term, moderately pre-
term, very preterm, and extremely preterm infants. We tested
the cross-product interaction terms between BMI and length
of gestation categories with the use of a Wald χ2 test. Mater-
nal obesity is related to medically indicated preterm delivery
throughincreasedincidenceofobstetriccomplications(eg,pre-
eclampsia) and to spontaneous extremely preterm delivery.7,22
In addition, preterm delivery is a strong risk factor for cere-
bral palsy. Therefore, we assessed whether an association be-
tween maternal BMI and cerebral palsy was mediated by pre-
term delivery using a counterfactual approach. We laid out a
causal diagram29 (Figure, A) to represent the potential medi-
ating effect of preterm delivery in the presence of common
causes (cause set 1) of exposure (BMI), mediator (preterm de-
livery), and outcome (cerebral palsy); and common causes
(cause set 2) of mediator and outcome. We estimated the di-
rect association of BMI on cerebral palsy independent of pre-
termdelivery,theindirectassociationofBMImediatedthrough
preterm delivery, and the proportion of the total BMI associa-
tion mediated through preterm delivery using Valeri and
VanderWeele’
sformulas.30Theseformulasallowforexposure-
mediator interactions and have been extended to the context
of time-to-event analysis with Cox regression.31 The method
assumes no unmeasured confounding (common causes) in the
exposure-outcome, mediator-outcome, and exposure-
mediator relations, and no effect of the exposure on confound-
ers of the mediator-outcome relation (ie, no arrow from BMI
tocauseset2inFigure,A).BecausetheassociationofBMIwith
cerebral palsy was linear, for parsimony we used BMI as a con-
tinuous variable in mediation analyses. Also, because the pro-
portion of the total effect mediated varies according to the ex-
posurevalueatwhichitisestimated,31weusedastheexposure
the difference between the median BMI of women with obe-
sity (32.8) and those without obesity (23.1) , which was ap-
proximately10units.Themediator—pretermdelivery—wasde-
fined dichotomously as less than 37 or 37 or more gestational
weeks and the outcome as time to cerebral palsy diagnosis or
censoring. The exposure-mediator and exposure-outcome re-
lations were modeled with logistic and Cox regression, respec-
tively, adjusted for sets of confounders (cause set 1: maternal
age,countryoforigin,educationlevel,cohabitationwithapart-
ner, parity, height, year of delivery; cause set 2:smoking dur-
ing pregnancy and child’
s sex) as categorical variables, and in-
cludinganinteractiontermbetweenBMIandpretermdelivery.
Because most children with cerebral palsy are born
at full term, we conducted further mediation analyses of the

association between early pregnancy BMI and cerebral palsy
in full-term children. The mediators considered were known
consequences of maternal obesity that are also possible causes
of cerebral palsy, including instrumental (cesarean or vagi-
nal) delivery, traumatic delivery, macrosomia (birth weight
>4000 g), neonatal infections, asphyxia-related neonatal com-
plications (meconium aspiration, hypoxic ischemic encepha-
lopathy, or neonatal seizures), Apgar score less than 7 at 5 min-
utes, presence of any congenital malformation, and presence
of nervous system malformations. The causal diagram was
modified (Figure, B) to represent the restriction on gesta-
tional age (box enclosing preterm delivery), each potential me-
diator, and a set of possible common causes (cause set 3: in-
trauterine growth) of the mediator and the outcome (cerebral
palsy). To restrict to full-term children, we assumed that there
were no unmeasured common causes of length of gestation
and mediators or cerebral palsy.
All mediators were defined as dichotomous variables. One
set of models for each potential mediator was fitted to esti-
mate direct and indirect associations with BMI, following the
same counterfactual approach described above. A BMI-
mediator interaction term was included to estimate the asso-
ciation of BMI on cerebral palsy by levels of the mediator; this
term was retained in the estimation of effects when it was sta-
tistically significant. In addition to the cause sets 1 and 2 , all
butthemodelsforcongenitalmalformationsalsoincludedbirth
weight for gestational age (cause set 3). All mediation analy-
ses were conducted with use of the %mediation macro31 for
SAS, version 9.4.
A sizeable proportion (10.5%) of women were excluded
from the primary analysis due to missing data on BMI. Be-
causeexclusionsduetomissingdatamayleadtoselectionbias,
we conducted supplemental analyses using multiple imputa-
tion of missing values. Missing values on BMI and covariates
wereestimatedusingaMarkovChainMonteCarlomultipleim-
putation method before their inclusion in the multivariable
models.32Thevariablesenteredintheimputationmethodwere
maternal age, country of origin, education level, cohabita-
tion with a partner, parity, height, smoking during preg-
nancy, year of delivery, BMI, gestational age at delivery, and
cerebral palsy diagnosis of the offspring. Results from 10 mul-
tiple imputation cycles were combined with use of the
MIANALYZE procedure of SAS.
In additional supplemental analyses, we examined the as-
sociations of maternal BMI with cerebral palsy subtypes, as de-
fined by ICD-10 codes (eTable 1 in the Supplement). A 2-tailed
P value of <.05 was used as the threshold for statistical sig-
nificance in all tests.

tion for 1 441 623 live singleton births. After excluding 17 694

births in which either the mothers or the children had invalid
national registration numbers, 1 423 929 live singleton births
(98.8%) were included in the study. Mean gestational age at
deliverywas39.8(SD,1.8)weeksand51.4%ofthechildrenwere
male. Compared with women with data on BMI, those ex-
cludedhadhigherratesofcerebralpalsyandwereslightlyolder
and more likely to be of non-Nordic origin, had higher parity,
were less likely to cohabit with a partner, were taller, and
smoked more during pregnancy, and their children had higher
rates of preterm delivery, low birth weight, neonatal infec-
tions, low Apgar score, and congenital malformations (eTable
2 in the Supplement).
There were 3029 children diagnosed with cerebral palsy
over a median 7.8 years of follow-up (interquartile range, 4.3-
11.7). The risk of cerebral palsy was 2.13 per 1000 live births
and the incidence rate was 2.63 per 10 000 child-years. Rates
of cerebral palsy were positively associated with low mater-
nal education, non-Nordic origin, not cohabiting with a part-
ner, primiparity or multiparity (≥4), short maternal stature,
smoking during pregnancy, and maternal diabetic or hyper-
tensivediseases(Table1).Ratesofcerebralpalsyincreasedwith
male sex, decreasing length of gestation, instrumental or trau-
matic delivery, birth weight for-gestational age less than the
10th or more than the 97th percentile, neonatal infections, and
congenitalmalformations(includingchromosomalabnormali-
ties and circulatory malformations) (Table 2). Malformations
of the nervous system, asphyxia-related neonatal morbidi-
ties, and a low Apgar score (<7) at 5 minutes were associated
with the largest increases in cerebral palsy rates (Table 2).
Mean early pregnancy BMI was 24.5 (SD, 4.4). The per-
centages of women in BMI categories were 2.4% for under-
weight (n = 30 765), 61.8% for normal weight (n = 787 815),
24.8% for overweight (n = 316 011), 7.8% for obesity grade 1
(n = 99 950), 2.4% for obesity grade 2 (n = 29 933), and 0.8%
for obesity grade 3 (n = 10 413). Early pregnancy BMI was posi-
tively related to cerebral palsy rates. The number of cerebral
palsy cases in each BMI category was 64, 1487, 728, 239, 88,
and 38; and the rates per 10 000 child-years were 2.58, 2.35,
2.92, 3.15, 4.00, and 5.19, respectively. Compared with chil-
dren of normal weight mothers, the adjusted HR of cerebral
palsy for overweight was 1.22 (95% CI, 1.11-1.33) and 1.28 (95%
CI, 1.11, 1.47) for obesity grade 1, 1.54 (95% CI, 1.24-1.93) for
grade 2, and 2.02 (95% CI, 1.46-2.79) for grade 3 (Table 3). Re-
sults were essentially unchanged in supplemental analyses of
diagnoses made after 1 year of age only (eTable 3 in the Supple-
ment) or in analyses with multiple imputation of missing data
(eTable 4 in the Supplement).
Of all children with cerebral palsy, 71% were born at
full term, 13% moderately preterm, 10% very preterm, and
6% extremely preterm. Gestational length modified the asso-
ciation between maternal BMI and rates of cerebral palsy
(P for interaction = .003). The rates of cerebral palsy in-
creased with maternal overweight and obesity severity only
in children born at full term (Table 4). In children born at full

term, the numbers of cerebral palsy cases and rates per 10 000
child-years in maternal BMI categories were 1056 cases (rate,
1.75) for normal weight, 525 cases (rate, 2.22) for overweight,
165 cases (rate, 2.31) for obesity grade 1, 69 cases (rate, 3.36)
for grade 2, and 23 cases (rate, 3.41) for grade 3. Compared with
normal weight women, adjusted HR for overweight and obe-
sitycategorieswere1.26(95%CI,1.14-1.41)foroverweight,1.30
(95% CI, 1.10-1.54) for obesity grade 1, 1.78 (95% CI, 1.38-2.29)
forgrade2,and1.86(95%CI,1.23-2.81)forgrade3.Amongchil-
dren born moderately preterm, only obesity grade 3 was as-
sociated with increased rates of cerebral palsy, whereas among
those born very or extremely preterm there was generally no
association between maternal BMI and cerebral palsy rates.
Results did not change in analyses with multiple imputation
of missing data (eTable 5 in the Supplement). When preterm
birth (<37 weeks) was considered as a potential mediator
(Figure, A), the HR of a 10-unit BMI increase from the base-
line level (median BMI of women without obesity, 23.1) was
1.32 (95% CI, 1.22-1.43) for total association, 1.29 (95% CI, 1.19-
1.40) for direct association, and 1.02 (95% CI, 1.02-1.03) for in-
direct association. Only 9.5% of the association of BMI with
cerebral palsy was mediated through preterm delivery.
In mediation analyses for consequences of maternal obe-
sity that may in turn cause cerebral palsy among children born
at full term (Figure, B and Table 5), an estimated 45% of the
association between BMI and cerebral palsy was mediated
through asphyxia-related neonatal complications, whereas
30% was mediated through low Apgar score. Instrumental de-
livery and nervous system malformations mediated 17% and
13% of the association, respectively. Other conditions each me-
diated less than 10%.
Among children born at full term, the strongest associa-
tions between maternal BMI and cerebral palsy were with dys-
kineticcerebralpalsyandspasticdiplegiccerebralpalsy(eTable
6 in the Supplement).
Discussion
In this nationwide Swedish study, maternal overweight and in-
creasinggradesofobesitywereassociatedwithincreasingrates
ofcerebralpalsy.Theassociationwasrestrictedtochildrenborn
at full term and was partly mediated through asphyxia-
related neonatal complications.
More than 70% of cerebral palsy cases occur in children
born at full term; thus, elucidating the etiology and identify-
ing possible preventable factors for cerebral palsy in this group
is of high clinical relevance. In this study, the association of
maternal BMI with cerebral palsy in full-term children was
partly mediated through asphyxia-related neonatal compli-
cations and, to a lesser extent, through low Apgar score and
instrumental delivery, which are also associated with perina-
tal asphyxia.33,34 The relative contribution of asphyxia to the
etiology of cerebral palsy is a matter of debate. In a review of
23 studies,35 the proportion of cerebral palsy cases with as-
phyxia varied from 3% to 56%, probably due to differences in
operational definitions of asphyxia, cerebral palsy, or both;
small sample sizes; and selection problems. The conditions
commonly used to define asphyxia, including hypoxic ische-
micencephalopathy,seizures,andlowApgarscore,arenotnec-
essarily specific for fetal hypoxia, but could be the result of
other pathologies including chorioamnionitis, stroke, or
inflammation.35 For most cases, cerebral palsy is thought to
be caused by multiple, often interrelated factors that may ob-
scure a specific effect of neonatal asphyxia. However, mater-
nal overweight and obesity are associated with increased risks
of emergency cesarean deliveries and hypoxic ischemic en-
cephalopathy, seizures, meconium aspiration, and low Apgar
scores at 5 and 10 minutes in full-term newborns.8,36 The ef-
fects of maternal obesity on severe neonatal asphyxia may be
partly explained by traumatic labor,37 which often results from

macrosomia.6 Another consequence of maternal obesity is fe-
tal hyperinsulinemia, which may be related to chronic hy-
poxia even without diabetes.38 Other mechanisms proposed
to explain an effect of maternal obesity on neonatal asphyxia
include lipotoxicity, placental inflammation and vasculopa-
thy,andcordcoiling.8Evidencehasdemonstratedalteredgene

volvingdysregulationofbraindevelopment,inflammatoryand
immune signaling, glucose and lipid homeostasis, and oxida-
tive stress.39
The BMI-related increase in cerebral palsy rates in full-
term children was strongest for dyskinetic cerebral palsy, the
subtype most often attributed to perinatal asphyxia in chil-
dren born at full term and most strongly related to low Apgar
scores.40 Children with dyskinetic cerebral palsy exhibit neu-
roradiological alterations in the basal ganglia or the thala-
mus, brain structures that are particularly sensitive to as-
phyxia at full term.40,41
The study has several strengths. The nationwide design
providedinformationonapproximately1.5millionbirthslinked
to other nationwide registries, reducing the possibility of se-
lection bias. Exposure information was prospectively col-
lected, and weight was measured in early pregnancy, mini-
mizing recall bias and measurement error. In addition to
adjustment for confounding factors, the relative homogene-
ity of the Swedish population and the existence of a publicly
funded, standardized health care system should limit re-
sidualconfoundingandprovidehighinternalvalidity.Thelarge

a HRs and 95% CIs from multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards
models. One model was fitted with each potential mediator. BMI-mediator
associations were modeled with multivariable logistic regression. Covariates
included maternal age (4 indicator variables with 30-34 years as reference),
country of origin (1 indicator with Nordic as reference), education level
(4 indicators with �15 years as reference), cohabitation with a partner
(1 indicator with yes as reference), parity (3 indicators with 1 as reference),
height (3 indicators with �170 cm as reference), year of delivery (3 indicators
with 2000-2004 as reference), smoking during pregnancy (1 indicator with no
as reference), child’s sex (1 indicator with female as reference), and birth
weight for gestational age percentile (4 indicators with 10-90 as reference).
The models for congenital malformations were not adjusted for birth weight
for gestational age. A BMI-mediator interaction term was tested and retained
if statistically significant at P < .05. All effects on cerebral palsy are estimated
for a 10-unit BMI difference from a baseline level of 23.1, at the reference
category of each covariate.
bTotal effect estimates may vary between models for different mediators due
to differences in the number of missing values for each mediator and
exposure-mediator interactions. They may differ from estimates by
levels of the mediator, even in the absence of interaction, due to
noncollapsibility of the HR.
c Estimated at mediator level “no.”
dSum of percentages is not necessarily 100 because the effects of mediators
are not mutually exclusive, mediators could interact with one another, and not
all mediators may have been considered.

ternal BMI and subtypes of cerebral palsy, and possible path-
ways that could mediate an effect of maternal BMI on rates of
cerebral palsy.
Therearealsosomelimitations.Tenpercentofwomenhad
missing information on BMI or important covariates, which
could lead to selection bias. The use of a new cerebral palsy
subtype classification system in Europe42 and the adoption of
a new global definition and classification43 that are slightly dif-
ferent from the international version of ICD-1044 may have in-
troduced some misclassification of subtypes. Because this lack
of specificity is independent of maternal BMI, the associa-
tions between maternal BMI and specific cerebral palsy
subtypes could be attenuated. Statistical power was lower for
the analyses of cerebral palsy subtypes than for the main
analysis. Because the Swedish population is relatively homo-
geneous, the results may not be generalizable to more hetero-
geneous populations.
Although the effect of maternal obesity on cerebral palsy
may seem small compared with other risk factors, the asso-
ciation is of public health relevance due to the large propor-
tion of women with overweight or obesity worldwide. The
number of women with a BMI of 35 or more globally doubled
from approximately 50 to 100 million from 2000 through
2010.44 In the United States, approximately half of all preg-
nant women have overweight or obesity at the first prenatal
visit.45Consideringthehighprevalenceofobesityandthecon-
tinued rise of its most severe forms, the finding that maternal
overweight and obesity are related to rates of cerebral palsy
in a dose-response manner may have serious public health
implications.46
Conclusions
Among Swedish women with singleton children, maternal
overweight and obesity were significantly associated with the
rate of cerebral palsy. The association was limited to children
born at full term and was partly mediated through asphyxia-
related neonatal complications.
