Emotional events are often remembered better than neutral events, a
benefit that many studies have hypothesized to depend on the
amygdala’s interactions with memory systems. These studies have
indicated that the amygdala can modulate memory-consolidation pro-
cesses in other brain regions such as the hippocampus and perirhinal
cortex. Indeed, rodent studies have demonstrated that direct activa-
tion of the amygdala can enhance memory consolidation even during
nonemotional events. However, the premise that the amygdala caus-
ally enhances declarative memory has not been directly tested in hu-
mans. Here we tested whether brief electrical stimulation to the
amygdala could enhance declarative memory for specific images of
neutral objects without eliciting a subjective emotional response.
Fourteen epilepsy patients undergoing monitoring of seizures via in-
tracranial depth electrodes viewed a series of neutral object images,
half of which were immediately followed by brief, low-amplitude
electrical stimulation to the amygdala. Amygdala stimulation elicited
no subjective emotional response but led to reliably improved mem-
ory compared with control images when patients were given a
recognition-memory test the next day. Neuronal oscillations in the
amygdala, hippocampus, and perirhinal cortex during this next-day
memory test indicated that a neural correlate of the memory enhance-
ment was increased theta and gamma oscillatory interactions be-
tween these regions, consistent with the idea that the amygdala
prioritizes consolidation by engaging other memory regions. These
results show that the amygdala can initiate endogenous memory pri-
oritization processes in the absence of emotional input, addressing a
fundamental question and opening a path to future therapies.

E
motional events often stand out in one’s recollections, sug-
gesting that the brain prioritizes memories by affective salience
(1–6). Many studies have pointed to a key role for the amygdala in
prioritizing emotional memories (1–13). In particular, patients with
bilateral damage to the amygdala displayed good memory in gen-
eral but, relative to healthy participants, typically showed no addi-
tional improvement in declarative memory for emotional words,
pictures, or stories (14). Evidence from functional neuroimaging
studies of emotional memory in healthy participants has also sup-
ported the role of the amygdala in enhancing memory for emo-
tional material (8–13, 15). For example, during emotional memory
encoding, both activity in the amygdala and measures of functional
connectivity with other medial temporal lobe (MTL) structures
correlated with the extent of subsequent emotional memory en-
hancement (8, 9, 11–13, 15). Further, increases in stress hormones
during or after an emotional experience can facilitate memory
consolidation and often correlate with fMRI activation of the
amygdala (5, 6, 16–21). These results from studies in humans have
underscored the importance of the amygdala but have left questions
about its causal role in the prioritization of emotional memories.
A large body of work in experimental animals has sought to
address these questions and has led to the hypothesis that the
amygdala directly modulates memory consolidation in other brain
regions (5, 6, 16–18, 21–25). A key set of findings was that direct
activation of the basolateral complex of the amygdala (BLA) via
electrical stimulation or local norepinephrine microinfusions even
during nonemotional events improved memory when tested on
subsequent days (5, 6, 16, 18, 22–25). Further, direct activation of
the BLA modulated neuronal activity and markers of synaptic
plasticity in the hippocampus and perirhinal cortex (16–18, 21, 24),
two structures important for declarative memory that are directly
innervated by the BLA (26). For example, memory-enhancing BLA
stimulation during the study phase of an object-recognition memory
task elicited intrahippocampal gamma synchrony that was sug-
gested to be related to cellular memory consolidation by influencing
spike-timing–dependent plasticity in the hippocampus (24). In an-
other study, hippocampal inactivation eliminated the amygdala-
mediated enhancement of object-recognition memory (23). These
and other studies (6, 16, 18) have led to the view that an emotional
experience engages the amygdala, which in turn enhances memory
for that experience through modulation of synaptic plasticity-
related processes underlying memory consolidation in other brain
regions (6, 16, 18). This model predicts that direct stimulation of
the human amygdala could enhance memory in a manner analo-
gous to emotion’s enhancing effects on long-term memory.
Significance
Memories for emotional events tend to persist, raising a funda-
mental question about how the brain prioritizes significant
memories. Past studies have pointed to a central role for the
amygdala in mediating this endogenous memory enhancement.
However, the premise that the amygdala can causally enhance
declarative memory has not been directly tested in humans. Here
we show that brief electrical stimulation to the human amygdala
can enhance declarative memory for specific images of neutral
objects without eliciting a subjective emotional response, likely by
engaging other memory-related brain regions. The results show
the human amygdala has a general capacity to initiate enhance-
ment of specific declarative memories rather than a narrower role
limited to indirectly mediating emotional effects on memory.

 Although data from studies examining the role of the human
amygdala in memory and emotion have broadly agreed with
results from experimental animals, several recent reports have
questioned the extent to which the human amygdala plays a di-
rect role in modulating memory processes. For example, in
addition to its role in emotional memory enhancement, the
amygdala is also thought to contribute to emotional arousal and
the subjective experience of emotion (27, 28). Thus, it is possible
that activation of the amygdala may influence a memory by as-
sociating it with an emotional context (29) or indirectly by trig-
gering emotional arousal (30) rather than, or in combination
with, directly modulating memory processes (31). For instance, if
stimulation of the amygdala led to an emotional experience, it
could induce further rumination or reappraisal of the material
even after the stimulus was removed from view, thereby poten-
tially strengthening memory encoding for that material. More-
over, studies in humans that have manipulated postencoding
memory processes via noxious arousal (e.g., nociceptive shocks)
or cognitive factors (e.g., selective attention or distinctiveness)
have shown that each manipulation can potentially contribute to
emotional memory enhancement, although the strength of the
evidence linking the memory effects of each of these manipula-
tions specifically to the amygdala varies considerably (6, 30, 32,
33). Further, most of these postencoding memory-enhancement
effects have been demonstrated for stimuli that already have an
emotional meaning (30, 32, 33), making it difficult to dissociate
the possible roles of the amygdala in emotion and memory. Fi-
nally, none of these studies of emotional memory in humans has
involved directly stimulating the amygdala, and those that have
stimulated the amygdala apart from memory testing have found
that subjective emotional responses and autonomic responses are
elicited infrequently and only at relatively high levels of stimula-
tion (34–36). Thus, it remains unknown whether direct electrical
stimulation of the human amygdala would be sufficient to enhance
memory and whether any such modulation would depend upon
eliciting a subjective or physiological emotional response.
The present study therefore sought to test in humans whether
directly engaging the amygdala can prioritize memory processes.
We specifically asked whether brief electrical stimulation applied
directly to the human amygdala could enhance recognition mem-
ory for specific images of neutral objects without eliciting an
emotional experience. Fourteen patients with depth electrodes
placed in the amygdala for clinical purposes performed a yes/no
recognition memory task for neutral images of objects. During
encoding, half of the images were followed by a 1-s low-amplitude
(0.5 mA) electrical stimulation to the amygdala. In addition,
patients were subsequently presented with 10 trials of amyg-
dala stimulation and 10 trials of sham stimulation in a random
order and were asked to judge which trials included the amyg-
dala stimulation. Amygdala stimulation reliably improved later
object-recognition memory with no elicited emotional response,
and this memory enhancement was reflected by specific neu-
ronal oscillations between the amygdala and memory-related
regions. The results agree with past studies in experimental ani-
mals and show the human amygdala has a general capacity to
initiate enhancement of specific declarative memories rather
than a narrower role limited to indirectly mediating emotional
effects on memory.
Results
The influence of brief amygdala stimulation on recognition-
memory performance for neutral object images was assessed in
14 epileptic patients (see Figs. S1 and S2 and Tables S1–S3 for
information on patients and locations of electrodes). Fig. 1
summarizes the object-recognition memory procedure and de-
picts that 1 s of low-amplitude electrical stimulation (eight trains
of 50 Hz, 0.5 mA biphasic pulses) was delivered at the offset of
image presentation for a randomly selected half of the objects
during the study phase of the task (Materials and Methods).
Memory performance was tested immediately after the study
phase and one day later.
Fig. 2 shows the memory performance as a standard discrim-
inability index (d′) and indicates that brief stimulation of the
amygdala following some images during the study phase en-
hanced recognition memory relative to control (no-stimulation)
images on the following day [stimulation vs. no stimulation d′:
mean(SEM) = 1.60(0.16) vs. 1.37(0.19), t (13) = 3.69, P = 0.003,
Cohen’s d = 0.99]. By comparison, there was no reliable effect of
stimulation on the immediate test [stimulation vs. no stimulation
d′: mean(SEM) = 2.68(0.24) vs. 2.55(0.24), t (13) = 1.07, P =
0.30, Cohen’s d = 0.29]. A repeated-measures ANOVA revealed
an overall effect of test day [F(1,13) = 94.60, P < 0.001] and an
overall effect of stimulation [F(1,13) = 6.11, P = 0.03]. The
better overall performance on the immediate test raises the
possibility that any benefit of amygdala stimulation might not be
distinguishable at this time point in this particular task (i.e., a
ceiling effect). Nevertheless, the reliability of the observed
memory benefit on the one-day test is consistent with the pre-
sumed role for the amygdala in modulating long-term memory-
consolidation processes (6, 16, 18, 21, 37, 38). No differences
in yes/no reaction times during the immediate or one-day test
were observed between stimulation and unstimulated control

 conditions (Fig. S3). No carryover effects of stimulation on
memory were observed for control images that followed stimu-
lation trials during the study phase (Fig. S4). Thus, although
these results do not distinguish which putative psychological
processes of recognition memory were influenced by amygdala
stimulation (e.g., episodic-like recollection and/or item-specific
familiarity), the lack of carryover indicates that the memory
enhancement was temporally specific. That is, objects in the
stimulation condition were remembered better than control
objects initially viewed only seconds (3–5 s) apart.
Fig. 2 also shows the results of a subsequent awareness test in
which subjects were asked to decide if amygdala stimulation had
been administered across 10 amygdala-stimulation and 10 sham-
stimulation trials that were presented in random order. All 14 pa-
tients denied subjective awareness of the amygdala stimulation on
every trial. In addition, no patient reported emotional responses
associated with amygdala stimulation during the stimulation
awareness test or during recognition-memory testing. Moreover,
similar amygdala-stimulation parameters caused no detectable au-
tonomic changes in patients (n = 7) undergoing stimulation pa-
rameter screening (Fig. S5). Thus, the amygdala stimulation used in
the present study was capable of reliably enhancing one-day object-
recognition memory performance without eliciting a subjective or
objective emotional response. Indeed, the patients were unable to
discriminate if or when any stimulation was being delivered.
Patients with epilepsy often exhibit cognitive deficits as a con-
sequence of chronic seizures, antiepileptic medications, and asso-
ciated neuronal dysfunction (39–41). Thus, an important question
was whether the benefit of amygdala stimulation was attenuated in
patients with poorer baseline memory function. The patients with
weakest baseline memory performance actually tended to show the
greatest stimulation-mediated improvements in recognition mem-
ory on the one-day test, suggesting that the benefit was possibly
attenuated in patients with higher baseline memory scores (Fig.
S6). In particular, the magnitude of the one-day memory en-
hancement was negatively correlated with all three baseline neu-
ropsychological performance measures [Rey Auditory Verbal
Learning Test discrimination index, r (12) = −0.61, P = 0.02; Rey–
Osterrieth Complex Figure Delayed Recall, r (12) = −0.56, P =
0.04; and Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) IV Full-Scale
IQ, r (12) = −0.37, P = 0.18] (Fig. S4). As an example, the patient
with the greatest baseline memory deficits routinely failed to rec-
ognize researchers and physicians she had met on multiple prior
occasions, but she exhibited the greatest stimulation-induced
memory-enhancement effect. If this patient’s memory-enhance-
ment effect was treated as an outlier and excluded from analy-
sis (although statistically it was not considered an outlier; see SI
Materials and Methods), the group memory-enhancement effect
remained significant [t (11) = 4.24 P = 0.001, Cohen’s d = 1.17]. In
addition, individual memory-enhancement effects persisted for
several patients despite the occurrence of seizures between the
encoding phase and the one-day recognition test (Table S2). These
observations highlight the robustness of the amygdala-mediated
memory-enhancement effect and suggest that amygdala stimula-
tion could provide substantial memory benefits even for patients
with significant baseline cognitive deficits.
We next sought to identify neural correlates of the amygdala-
mediated memory enhancement within MTL structures. The
hippocampus and perirhinal cortex are both important for nor-
mal recognition memory (42–48). Each receives direct in-
nervation from the BLA (26), and amygdala-mediated memory
enhancement in rats requires intact hippocampal function (23).
Thus, for the entire subset of patients with electrodes localized
concurrently in the amygdala, hippocampus, and perirhinal
cortex (n = 5 patients), local field potentials (LFPs) from each
region were recorded simultaneously during the immediate and
one-day recognition-memory tests (Fig. S2); stimulation artifacts
precluded analysis of LFPs from the study session itself. The
enhancement effect on the one-day test across these five patients
(mean stimulation − control d′ difference = 0.22) was similar to
the mean (0.23) across all 14 patients (for patients S3, S6, S8,
S10, and S14: stimulation-control d′ differences on the one-day
test were 0.40, 0.00, 0.07, 0.44, and 0.19, respectively, and on the
immediate test were 0.06, 0.36, 0.31, 0.55, and 0.60, respectively).
An example of these recordings (Fig. 3A) illustrates that LFP os-
cillations were apparent in the theta (here 5–7 Hz) and gamma
(30–55 Hz) ranges, although the intermittent nature of the gamma
oscillations obscured peaks in the average spectrograms. Analyses
of neuronal oscillations during the first 0.5 s of recognition-
memory trials were used to investigate how prior amygdala stim-
ulation during the study phase affected subsequent oscillatory
interactions during retrieval within the MTL. Spectral power within
each region and coherence between each region-to-region pair
were baseline-normalized, and main results were calculated as the
difference between the oscillatory activity for remembered object
images in the stimulation condition vs. the no-stimulation condition
(Materials and Methods and Fig. 3 B–G). Recognition during the
one-day test but not during the immediate test exhibited increased
power in perirhinal cortex in the gamma frequency range for re-
membered objects previously followed by stimulation compared
with remembered objects without stimulation [t(4) = 5.01, P =
0.007, Cohen’s d = 2.24]. Furthermore, LFPs during the one-day
test, but not during the immediate test, revealed increased co-
herence of hippocampal–perirhinal oscillations in the theta fre-
quency range for remembered objects previously followed by
stimulation compared with remembered objects without stimula-
tion [t(4) = 3.62, P = 0.02, Cohen’s d = 1.67] (Fig. 3 D–G). These
results suggest that amygdala stimulation benefitted memory by
influencing neural activity in brain regions normally important for
recognition memory.
To examine the interactions between theta and gamma oscilla-
tions, we calculated a modulation index of cross-frequency (theta–
gamma) phase-amplitude coupling (see Materials and Methods for
details and refs. 49–51). Specifically, we calculated the extent to
which the phase of the BLA theta oscillations modulated the
amplitude of the perirhinal gamma oscillations during accurate
retrieval of images previously encoded with and without stimula-
tion. During both the immediate and one-day tests, the phase of
the amygdala theta oscillations indeed modulated the amplitude of
perirhinal gamma oscillations, particularly around 50 Hz, and did

 so to a significantly greater extent on the one-day test for re-
membered objects in the stimulated condition than for remem-
bered objects in the no-stimulation control condition [t(4) = 3.04,
P = 0.04, Cohen’s d = 1.36] (Fig. 4). Thus, accurately recognizing
objects from the stimulation condition during the one-day test was
accompanied by oscillatory patterns suggesting that network in-
teractions between the amygdala and other memory regions un-
derlie the memory enhancement.
Discussion
The present study demonstrates that brief electrical stimulation
to the human amygdala reliably improved long-term recognition
memory for images of neutral objects without eliciting an emo-
tional response. This memory enhancement was accompanied by
neuronal oscillations during retrieval that reflected increased
interactions between the amygdala, hippocampus, and perirhinal
cortex. The experiment was motivated by prior research in ex-
perimental animals in which activation of the amygdala by direct
electrical stimulation or local microinfusions of norepinephrine
improved subsequent memory and modulated neuronal activity
or synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus and perirhinal cortex
(5, 6, 16, 18, 22–25). Indeed, our approach was directly mod-
eled on recent studies in rats in which brief electrical amyg-
dala stimulation enhanced recognition memory of novel neutral
objects but in which direct assessment of subjective experience
was not possible (Fig. S7) (22–24). In rats, amygdala stimulation
elicited intrahippocampal gamma synchrony that was reflected
as coordinated timing of action potentials of hippocampal CA3
pyramidal neurons with membrane potentials in downstream
neurons in hippocampal region CA1 (24), and hippocampal in-
activation eliminated the amygdala-mediated memory enhance-
ment (23). The current results suggest fundamentally similar
mechanisms of memory enhancement across rats and humans
and indicate a causal role for the amygdala in memory that, in
humans, is dissociable from subjective emotional experience.
Although the amygdala’s role in emotional memory has been
well established, the current findings suggest that the amygdala
can play a discrete role in modulating memory consolidation
apart from emotional experience.
These results also suggest an important role for the hippo-
campus and perirhinal cortex in amygdala-mediated enhance-
ment of long-term memory, which is consistent with prior
evidence of the importance of these MTL regions for recognition
memory more generally (42–48). Moreover, the enhancement-
related patterns of oscillations observed during the one-day
memory test resembled the theta-modulated gamma burst pat-
tern of the amygdala stimulation delivered during the study
phase. This reappearance of theta-modulated gamma oscilla-
tions in the MTL during retrieval could possibly indicate a
reactivation of an amygdala-induced network state or could re-
flect the overall importance of theta and gamma oscillations for
appropriate medial temporal lobe function. In either case, it is
known that many of the cellular consolidation processes related
to long-term synaptic plasticity in memory networks unfold over
the course of hours (6, 16, 18, 21, 37, 38). Thus, it is possible that
amygdala stimulation initiated specific synaptic plasticity-related
molecular cascades, resulting in a cumulative benefit to memory
that emerged only over a protracted period as cellular processes
progressed. One notion is that increased glutamatergic release
from amygdala terminals in regions such as the hippocampus up-
regulates the induction of immediate but small molecular changes
at active synapses, which in turn increase the likelihood that those
synapses will undergo slower but more robust molecular and
structural changes over subsequent hours to days (17, 31). In this
view, plasticity in memory structures initiated by viewing of the
object images would be magnified by amygdala stimulation.
Our study raises several technical considerations. First, as in
any study examining the effects of direct electrical stimulation in
patients undergoing intracranial electrode monitoring, our study
necessarily consisted of patients with intractable epilepsy rather
than healthy individuals. Intracranial monitoring typically sam-
ples broad territories of brain representing putatively normal and
pathological tissue to accurately localize and define the bound-
aries of the patient’s specific seizure focus or network (52). Al-
though specific foci of each patient’s brain were presumed to be
functioning abnormally, we accounted for the clinical heteroge-
neity across patients by using a within-subject design, compar-
ing each patient’s performance and electrophysiological responses
in the stimulated vs. unstimulated conditions. Also, memory-
enhancement effects were observed regardless of anatomical
proximity to seizure onsets, and this specifically included several
subjects in whom the hippocampus ipsilateral to amygdala stim-
ulation was independently implicated in seizure onsets (Table S2).
Additionally, analogous memory-enhancement results resembled
those from three prior studies in rats without seizures, suggesting
that our findings are unrelated to epilepsy. Second, although we
examined whether brief, low-amplitude amygdala stimulation eli-
cited an explicit subjective emotional response, further studies of
the potential effects of low-amplitude amygdala stimulation on
subtler implicit evaluations of emotional valence and arousal are
needed. Third, this study did not examine the neurophysiologi-
cal effects of amygdala stimulation during the encoding phase due
to recorded signals being obscured by stimulation artifacts. Fu-
ture studies using recording techniques that eliminate or minimize
such stimulation artifacts are needed to determine the effects of

 amygdala stimulation on hippocampal and perirhinal oscillatory
activity during encoding. Finally, although the memory-enhance-
ment effect from amygdala stimulation was reliable and significant
across the majority of tested patients, it is possible that different
stimulation parameters (i.e., location, frequency, duration, and tim-
ing of stimulation) might induce more robust amygdala-mediated
memory enhancement. Future studies will calibrate amygdala
stimulation parameters to amplify memory-enhancement effects
in patients suffering from memory impairments.
Human brain stimulation not only reveals potential causal mech-
anisms of normal brain function but also has therapeutic implica-
tions. Although chronically implanted stimulation devices are used to
treat a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders safely and
effectively, effective means for improving cognitive disorders and
specifically enhancing memory remain elusive (39–41, 49, 53). Our
description of amygdala-mediated memory enhancement provides
unique results with respect to target and effects relative to prior ef-
forts in humans (39–41, 49, 53). For instance, alternative strategies
directly targeting the hippocampus or entorhinal cortex have yielded
inconsistent effects on memory among individuals and across studies
(39–41). Further, some recent reports suggest that real-time classi-
fication of the brain’s encoding state may be needed to produce
proper timing of stimulation and memory enhancement during poor
encoding states (39, 41). Although we found robust and reliable
memory enhancement without such closed-loop classification of the
memory-encoding state, knowledge of the memory-encoding state
with stimulation only for poorly encoded items could possibly
strengthen the enhancement of stimulated relative to unstimulated
memories. This potential closed-loop approach to memory en-
hancement is aided by our demonstration that amygdala stimulation
can produce reliable, temporally specific memory-enhancement ef-
fects even when delivered following an experience by allowing de-
termination of the memory-encoding state during an experience.
The consistent memory enhancement we observed may be
related to the proposed role for the amygdala as an overarching
modulator of downstream memory structures. Capitalizing upon
this endogenous capacity to engage memory networks may offer
therapeutic advantages. Indeed, to date no other invasive or
noninvasive human brain-stimulation studies have shown tem-
porally specific memory enhancement across periods longer than
a few minutes after initial stimulation and encoding (39–41, 49,
50, 53). Indeed, with amygdala-mediated memory enhancement,
we observe temporally specific learning that is robust after a
single trial and persists to the following day. Notably, memory
enhancement occurred broadly among the majority of subjects
tested, even in subjects with baseline memory deficits, and
likewise did not impair any individual subject’s memory the next
day. Finally, accurate memory retrieval related to clear electro-
physiological signatures of prior stimulation-enhanced consolida-
tion, providing evidence of amygdala stimulation’s impact upon
downstream memory structures.
In conclusion, our study constitutes direct evidence for a
causal role of the human amygdala in the initiation of temporally
specific memory enhancement and consequent functional changes
in the hippocampus and perirhinal cortex without eliciting a
subjective emotional response. By directly adapting an analogous
paradigm from object-recognition memory-enhancement exper-
iments in experimental animals, we extend previous knowledge
while making observations relevant to humans. Parallel efforts
across species will foster future studies of the network, cellular,
and molecular mechanisms of amygdala-mediated memory en-
hancement with relevance to normal and pathological memory.
Such work will reveal the basic mechanisms of endogenous
memory prioritization while also advancing translational inter-
ventions to treat human memory impairment.
Materials and Methods
Participants. Fourteen participants (five females) with drug-resistant epilepsy
volunteered and provided written informed consent (Tables S1–S3). The
study protocol was approved by the Emory University Institutional Review
Board. Standard stereotactic depth electrode arrays were implanted into the
brain parenchyma by a neurosurgeon (J.T.W. or R.E.G.) for the sole purpose
of clinical seizure investigation. The number of patients was predetermined
by a formal power (target = 0.8) analysis.
Brain Stimulation and Recording. Electrode contacts were localized manually
following coregistration of pre- and postoperation brain scans (Figs. S1 and
S2). Stimulation parameters were chosen to replicate those used in three
prior rat studies that demonstrated amygdala-mediated memory enhance-
ment (22–24). Specifically, stimulation was delivered to the BLA in current-
regulated, charge-balanced, biphasic rectangular pulses at 0.5 mA for 1 s in
eight trains of four pulses at 50 Hz. LFPs were recorded at a sampling rate of
either 500 or 1,000 Hz. No seizure activity or afterdischarges to stimulation
were detected during testing or in a thorough posttest review of all recorded
LFP channels by a clinical epileptologist (R.E.F.).
Behavioral Tasks.
Recognition-memory task procedure. During the study phase, each participant
viewed 160 images of neutral object images (51), one trial at a time, and was
asked to make an “indoor” vs. “outdoor” judgment with respect to the
image on each trial. A fixation screen was presented for a jittered duration
of 0.5–1.5 s immediately before each image onset. Each image was then
presented for 3 s, and in a randomly selected half of the trials (stimulation

 condition), offset of the image coincided with the onset of 1 s of stimulation
to the BLA. The intertrial interval was 5 s. Memory was tested via a self-
paced yes/no (i.e., repeated/new) recognition-memory test for half the im-
ages (40 from the stimulation condition and 40 from the no-stimulation
condition) immediately after the end of the study session; memory for the
remaining images (40 from the stimulation condition and 40 from the no-
stimulation condition) was tested approximately one day later (M = 22 h,
range = 20–25 h delay). Forty new images served as foils, and different foils
were used for each test. After making yes/no judgments, participants also
made sure/not sure certainty judgments. Analysis of certainty judgments
was not performed because some subjects did not seem to understand
the certainty judgment instructions (e.g., some participants paired sure
with all “yes” responses and not sure with all “no” responses). No elec-
trical stimulation was delivered during either recognition-memory test.
Stimulation awareness test procedure. After the one-day recognition test, par-
ticipants were administered 20 trials in which a button was pressed to deliver
either stimulation or sham stimulation (no current) and were asked “Did you
feel any stimulation?” Stimulation to the BLA using the same parameters as
during the memory task was delivered in only a randomly selected half of the
trials, and participants were not told which trials omitted the stimulation.
Electrophysiological Data Analysis. Analyses of electrophysiological data fo-
cused on oscillations in LFPs recorded simultaneously from the BLA, hippo-
campus, and perirhinal cortex in five patients with electrodes simultaneously
present in all three regions (Fig. S2). Data from the first 0.5 s of each correctly
answered trial (before yes/no judgments) in both the immediate and one-
day memory tests were analyzed. Analyses focused on the test sessions be-
cause electrical stimulation was delivered during the study session only after
object images were presented and because the electrical stimulation pro-
duced substantial electrical artifacts. In addition, for several of the five pa-
tients in the LFP analyses, there were relatively few incorrect images in the
stimulation condition on either test. Thus, comparing LFPs between correct
and incorrect trials was not feasible. Please see Supporting Information for a
detailed description of LFP analyses.
