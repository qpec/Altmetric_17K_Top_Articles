Abstract
Objectives
We report information about an unpublished 1970s study (“8-way” Bendectin Study) that
aimed to evaluate the relative therapeutic efficacy of doxylamine, pyridoxine, and dicyclo-
mine in the management of nausea and vomiting during pregnancy. We are publishing the
trial’s findings according to the restoring invisible and abandoned trials (RIAT) initiative
because the trial was never published.
Design
Double blinded, multi-centred, randomized placebo-controlled study.
Setting
14 clinics in the United States.
Participants
2308 patients in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy with complaints of nausea or vomiting were
enrolled.
Interventions
Each patient was randomized to one of eight arms: placebo, doxylamine/pyridoxine/dicylco-
mine, doxylamine/pyridoxine, dicylomine/pyridoxine, doxylamine, dicyclomine/pyridoxine,
pyridoxine and dicyclomine. Each patient was instructed to take 2 tablets at bedtime and 1
additional tablet in the afternoon or morning if needed, for 7 nights.

 Outcomes
Reported outcomes included the number of hours of nausea reported by patients, the fre-
quency of vomiting reported by patients and the overall efficacy of medication as judged by
physicians.
Results
Data from 1599 (69% of those randomized) participants were analyzed. Based on the avail-
able summary data of physician evaluation of symptoms and ignoring missing data and data
integrity issues, the proportion of participants who were “evaluated moderate or excellent”
was greater in each of the seven active treatment groups when compared with placebo
(57%): doxylamine/pyridoxine/dicylcomine (14% absolute difference versus placebo; 95%
CI: 4 to 24), doxylamine/pyridoxine (21; 95% CI 11 to 30), dicylomine/pyridoxine (21; 95%
CI 11 to 30), doxylamine (20; 95% CI 10 to 29), dicyclomine/pyridoxine (4; 95% CI -6 to 14),
pyridoxine (9; 95% CI -1 to 19) and dicyclomine (4; 95% CI -6 to 14). Based on incomplete
information, the most common adverse events were apparently drowsiness and fatigue.
There is a high risk of bias in these previously unpublished results given the high attrition
rate in a 7 day trial, the lack of prespecified outcomes or analyses, and the exclusion of
some data because of questionable data integrity.
Conclusion
The available information about this “8-way Bendectin” trial indicates it should not be used
to support the efficacy of doxylamine, pyridoxine or dicyclomine for the treatment of nausea
and vomiting during pregnancy because of a high risk of bias.

Introduction
Nausea and vomiting are common symptoms experienced during pregnancy and may affect
more than 80% of pregnant women [1, 2]. Nausea and vomiting during pregnancy (NVP) is
self-limited and often resolves abruptly without treatment around the start of the second tri-
mester [2]. Symptomatic treatments for NVP include dietary changes such as eating small
meals frequently, non-pharmacological treatments such as ginger and pharmacological treat-
ments including antiemetics that are used outside of pregnancy such as antihistamines and
metoclopramide [3].
Doxylamine-pyridoxine is the first-line pharmacological therapy for NVP according to the
current guideline by the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologist of Canada [4], Motherisk
[5], and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists [6]. One prescription for
doxylamine-pyridoxine is filled for every two live births in Canada [7]. In contrast, antihista-
mines as a class are recommended for NVP in the United Kingdom [8].
There is limited published evidence for the efficacy of doxylamine and pyridoxine accord-
ing to a recent Cochrane systematic review [3]. One unpublished study has been referred to
in support of the use of the combination of doxylamine and pyridoxine. The “Bendectin

 Antinauseant 8-way” study was conducted during the 1970s and the Cochrane review was crit-
icized for not including this study: “The Cochrane review did not provide complete informa-
tion on the fact that this combination was approved by the FDA for use in the United States
after a multi-arm RCT in the 1970s.” [9]. A narrative review of doxylamine-pyridoxine’s effi-
cacy and safety for NVP in 2000 cites the unpublished 8-way study’s result, which “confirmed
that the efficacy of Bendectin was greater than that of placebo but showed no contributions
from dicyclomine in the association. Doxylamine was the major component, but pyridoxine
had a clear effect on nausea but probably not vomiting” [10]. A 2014 article on the effectiveness
and fetal safety of delayed-release combination of doxylamine and pyridoxine for the treat-
ment of NVP references the unpublished study’s result: “Doxylamine most effective, dicyclo-
mine no effect, pyridoxine effective for nausea but not vomiting” [11]. The website Bendectin.
com (a website funded by Diclectin manufacturer Duchesnay Inc.) referenced the unpublished
study as a factor in the reformulation of Bendectin: “Following an 8-way study, Bendectin was
reformulated in 1976 to contain only the two active ingredients (doxylamine, pyridoxine) that
demonstrated efficacy to treat NVP.” [12]. The United States Food and Drug Administration’s
(US FDA’s) initial approval of Bendectin was apparently based on this trial: “The 1975 FDA
Review of the ‘8-way’ study confirms that doxylamine alone and the combination of doxyla-
mine and pyridoxine were effective in the control of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy” [12].
This 8-way trial was also considered in the US FDA’s recent approval of a new product con-
taining doxylamine and pyridoxine because approval of combination products require that
efficacy is demonstrated for each active ingredient [12]. The dose of doxylamine and pyridox-
ine used in the 8-way trial (10 mg each) is the same as that in the currently approved and rec-
ommended treatments.
Given the reliance on this unpublished trial and the current common usage of doxylamine
and pyridoxine, we are publishing information about this trial according to the restoring invis-
ible and abandoned trials (RIAT) initiative [13].
Methods
Restoring invisible and abandoned trials (RIAT) protocol
This paper adheres to the reporting standards that ensure accountability outlined in the RIAT
initiative methods [13]. In order to obtain information about this trial, we made freedom of
information requests to the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) (13 April
2015), Health Canada (6 September 2011) and the European Medicines Agencies (29 April
2015). We also contacted the Bendectin Peer Group as well as several other individuals with
experience obtaining unpublished data. We reviewed approximately 36 000 pages of informa-
tion received from the FDA and approximately 7 200 pages were related to this trial. (The
other pages were apparently about other studies, malformation reports and various correspon-
dences. Some pages contained information that was difficult to read as apparently the informa-
tion was stored on microfiches). After reviewing the information from the US FDA, we called
the FDA to ask if any higher quality reproductions were available or if any further information
(such as subsequent submissions) was available and we were told that we were sent all informa-
tion relevant to our broad request. We also obtained 359 pages of information from Health
Canada but 212 pages were redacted. The European Medicines Agency informed us that they
had no relevant records related to our request. We received no relevant information from
Duchesnay following our request.
We were unable to contact any of the site investigators listed in the report after searching
for their contact information online; we found some indications that many of the investigators
have since died. The Bendectin Peer Group, who were assembled to review the study for the
RCT of Doxylamine, Pyridoxine and Dicyclomine for Nausea and Vomiting during Pregnancy

 US FDA, were notified by the restorative authors via fax on August 3, 2013 and were asked to
respond in 30 days. None declared any intention to restore the record (appendix A). On 26
September 2013, as per the RIAT initiative methods [13], we posted to the BMJ website a rapid
response publicly declaring our intent to publish the trial’s findings: "Following the publication
of the Restoring invisible and abandoned trials (RIAT) paper, we notified 4 members of the
Bendectin Peer Group on 8 August 2013 that we intend to publish the results of the unpub-
lished 1970s study on the efficacy of doxylamine and pyridoxine (“8-way” Bendectin Study).
As of 25 September 2013, 3 did not respond to our letter and 1 responded but did not register
intent to publish the trial. We are now publicly declaring our intention to publish the findings
of this clinical trial." No response was received.
The original report of the Bendectin Peer Group study is included in appendix B. In addi-
tion, the RIAT audit record (RIATAR), which documents the sources of all information is also
included in appendix C.
The description of the design and conduct of the study below is based on the information
we reviewed.
Design
The study used a double blind, multi-centred, randomized controlled study design. 14 clinics
in the United States were involved. Factorial analyses were performed. No sample size calcula-
tion was reported.
Participants
Eligibility criteria included the following: women in the first trimester of pregnancy (first 12
weeks of gestation), complaining of nausea and/or vomiting, and “only those who, in the opin-
ion of the investigator, will be cooperative and complete the questionnaires”.
Interventions
Each patient in the study was randomized into 1 of the following 8 interventions: (1) 10 mg
dicyclomine hydrochloride (Bentyl), (2) 10 mg doxylamine succinate (Decapryn), (3) dicyclo-
minehydrocholride/doxylamine succinate combination (10 mg each), (4) placebo, (5) 10 mg
pyridoxine hydrochloride. (6) dicyclomine hydrochloride/ pyridoxine succinate combination
(10 mg each), (7) Doxylamine succinate/ pyridoxine succinate combination (10 mg each), (8)
dicyclomine hydrochloride/ doxylamine succinate/ pyridoxine hydrochloride combination
(10 mg each) (Bendectin). Each patient was instructed to take 2 tablets at bedtime and, if nec-
essary, 1 additional tablet in the morning and in the midafternoon, for 7 nights.
Outcomes
Reported outcomes included physician judgements of efficacy (excellent, moderate, slight, or
none), the number of hours of nausea reported on the patients’ daily diary cards, and the fre-
quency of vomiting reported on the patients’ daily diary cards. The protocol does not indicate
which outcome was the primary outcome and the trial was done before trials were registered
prospectively.
The data were collected from the patient’s “In Dr.’s Office” or baseline daily diary card,
7-day self-report and the investigator’s initial and final evaluations. During the initial visit, the
investigator completed and recorded the initial patient evaluation. Each patient was given the
baseline card to complete immediately and 7 daily report forms to be completed each day of
the intervention. The importance of completing the form promptly and not waiting until the

 end of the study to complete all forms was emphasized. At the end of the 7 days of interven-
tion, the patients returned to the investigator who checked the forms for completeness,
obtained any additional information and completed a final evaluation. The FDA- required
Drug Experience Form (FD-1639) was to be completed for every patient who experienced seri-
ous side effects. Adverse events were recorded by physicians when volunteered by participants.
“Study completed according to protocol” is defined as availability of 7 or 8 patient diary
cards (including the baseline card) with one or more check marks in each part of each diary
card.
Reasons for noncompliance were recorded. Adverse events were apparently recorded in the
physician evaluation form.
Randomization
During the initial visit, the investigator enrolled patients into the study and obtained consent.
To ensure allocation concealment, a centralised service at Merrell-National Laboratories was
used. Medications were identical in appearance and had the coating used for Bendectin. Each
medication was packaged in bottles of 30 tablets and each bottle was labeled with a tear-off
label. The sealed tear-off portion contained the identity of the contents. The randomized inter-
vention was to be revealed only after serious problem arose, and after contacting the project
monitor at Merrell-National Laboratories.
Statistical analysis
We report here the findings and one-sided p-values as they were originally reported.
The data were analysed by the Biostatisical Department of Merrell-National Laboratories.
The statistical methods were not reported. Wherever possible, we also present our estimate
of the same results. As original results were presented as percentages, without denominators
or numerical results, we used information available elsewhere in the trial report to estimate
denominators for each treatment arm and to calculate exact numbers of women with spe-
cific outcomes based on reported percentages. Where we have relied on estimates rather
than directly reported data, we have identified estimates as such in the relevant tables. We
assume p-values less than 0.05 are statistically significant and we did not correct for multiple
comparisons.
For our estimate of the difference between treatment groups based on available summary
information, we used an “N -1” chi-squared implemented by MedCalc (Belgium). [14, 15]
Complete individual participant level data were not available.
Risk of bias
We used the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool to assess the quality of the trial [16]. The two authors
each independently made assessments and discussed disagreements. Further changes were
made during the peer review process.
Registration
The trial was conducted before trial registration was routine. We were unable to retrospec-
tively register this trial because the available information collected was insufficient. The Insti-
tutional Review Board details were not available.

 Results
Information received
We obtained from the US FDA the original study report including the protocol and summary
results, completed data collection forms for less than 25% of participants and correspondences
regarding the trial and its review by the FDA (Appendix B).” We were unable to obtain the
final study findings as the report used in this publication is apparently an interim one: “This
submission contains information on case reports received through July 22 1974. Information
on case reports subsequent to this date will be supplied in a future submission.” We are not
aware of any subsequent submissions. We report here the findings from the study that is cur-
rently referenced in the literature.
We did not obtain any additional clearly relevant information from other sources; a large
portion of the information received from Health Canada was redacted.
Of the 32 initial clinician investigators of the study, 3 never started the study, 26 terminated
or completed their porting, and 3 were still actively collecting data at the time the report was
generated. The data for 30 patients recruited by one of the investigators (who was one of the
three recorded as actively collecting data) were excluded from the study following receipt of a
March 19, 1975 letter from the Commissioner of Food and Drugs: “We find instances of over-
statement of study duration; of data recording in absence of patient visits; instances where
doubt exists concerning the identification of the product under investigation; and instances of
non-reporting of the occurrence of ’pregnancies during the course of a contraceptive study.”
The results from the original study include the following information for each arm of treat-
ment: severity of nausea or vomiting, prevalence of side effects, overall effectiveness of medica-
tion, the number of patients allocated, lost to follow up and completed per protocol.
Trial results
The number assessed for eligibility is unknown. 2359 patients were initially enrolled and ran-
domized in the study. 51 patients had unspecified “incomplete data” and were excluded from
the study population after randomization. Of the remaining 2308 patients for whom some
baseline characteristics are available (Table 1), 132 (6%) participants did not complete the
study and were classified as “no return” or lost to follow up. 709 (30%) patients failed to meet
protocol criteria and were excluded from the study (see S1 Table for reasons), leaving 1599
(65.8% of allocated) participants. Data about adverse events were missing for an additional 18
participants. The number randomized to each group was not reported but allocation seems to
have been roughly even. (Fig 1) We could not find information about typical baseline charac-
teristics (age, parity, duration of pregnancy at enrollment). Baseline symptoms are shown in
Table 1.
We did not find information about adherence to trial interventions in the US FDA
documents.
The difference between groups in symptom improvements according to physician evalua-
tion (Table 2) and patient symptoms diaries (Table 3) were summarized in the review report.
The results are reproduced from the review report and show one-sided p-values and no
denominators. In Table 3, we could not determine how the “percent reduction from pre-treat-
ment” was calculated.
We estimated the differences between groups using the available summary information
about physician evaluations (Tables 4 and 5). We assumed that the number of participants in
each group was equal to those who completed the study per protocol and we assumed the

 reported percentage improvements shown in Tables 2 and 3. We disregarded the missing data
for the purposes of the calculation.
The results of some factorial analyses comparing the three combinations containing each
constitutent the combination not containing that constituent were reported: combinations
containing doxylamine were superior by both physician records and patient reports
(p < 0.01); combinations containing pyridoxine were superior according to patient reports
(p < 0.01) but the difference was not statistically significant based on physician records
(p = 0.08); and for dicyclomine factorial analyses were not reported although there was a com-
ment that “the contribution of dicyclomine to the efficacy of doxylamine when given in combi-
nation was not measurable in this study”.
Adverse effects
Adverse event information was reportedly available for 2158 participants (93%). No serious
adverse effects were reported for any of the medications used in the study. The total number of

 adverse events and the incidence of the most common adverse events reported are shown in

Risk of bias
The risk of bias was high in several domains (Table 7). The trial predated reporting guidelines
and information about several domains was incomplete.
Discussion
This previously unpublished 1970s trial of medications for NVP that has been cited as support-
ing the use of doxylamine-pyridoxine has several important limitations: the final results of the
study are not available, data from more than 30% of recruited individuals were not analyzed
although the follow up period was only one week, few details about outcome determination or
statistical analyses were provided. The integrity of the data is questionable because data from
at least one investigator were subsequently excluded for reasons including “data recording in
absence of patient visits”. The data known to be of questionable integrity was a small fraction

 of the data included in the available interim analysis and we do not know if problems with the
integrity of other data were identified, the reason the final results of the trial are not available
or the reason these results were not published previously. The risk of bias was high in several
domains. Also, limited baseline data is available, the number of tablets taken by each partici-
pant is not available and that number could have doubled based on as needed use, the method
by which physicians scored symptoms was not clear, outcome data is unavailable for 37% of
participants in the placebo arm that was used as the reference for comparisons, p-values were
one-sided and not corrected for the multiple comparisons made, the approach to accounting
for the effect of missing data is not described and some information about adverse events may
be missing.
The US FDA review report for the 8-way study concluded that the combination of doxyla-
mine, pyridoxine and dicyclomine is efficacious in the treatment of NVP and that the effica-
cious components are likely doxylamine and pyridoxine but not dicyclomine. Several sources
have cited this trial in support of doxylamine and pyridoxine for the treatment of nausea and

judgment
Support for judgment
Sequence Generation (selection bias)
Unclear
The investigators do not describe the sequence generation process. It is unclear from the
available information whether sequence generation was random.
Allocation Concealment (selection
bias)
Unclear
Participants and investigators enrolling participants could not foresee assignment because a
centralized service at Merrell-National Laboratories was used to allocate the study groups.
Typical baseline characteristics were not reported.
Blinding of participants and
researchers (performance bias)
Low
The medications and bottles were identical in appearance. Each medication was packaged
in bottles of 30 tablets and each bottle was labeled with a tear-off label. The sealed-off
portion contained the identity of the contents.
Blinding of outcome assessment
(detection bias)
Low
The outcome assessors (physicians from multiple centers and participants) were blinded to
the intervention. It is unclear if data analysts were blinded.
Incomplete outcome data (attrition
bias)
High
Apparently results were analyzed for 1599 (68%) of 2359. 51 of the 2359 participants were
initially excluded from the study due to “incomplete data”. Of the remaining participants, 6%
did not complete the study and were classified as lost to follow up and 30% failed to meet
protocol criteria and were excluded from the study. In addition, information about adverse
outcomes are missing for a small fraction of analysed participants.
Selective outcome reporting (reporting
bias)
High
No outcomes were prespecified. The trial was done before outcomes were registered.
Multiple outcomes are reported without identifying any as primary.
Other potential threats to validity
High
Important information about the study is not available. The FDA ordered that data from one
investigator be excluded because of concerns about data integrity. The trial was apparently
not completed. The results were never published.

 vomiting during pregnancy [9–12, 17]. In 2013, the US FDA referred to the results of this trial
in approving a product containing doxylamine and pyridoxine: “. . .this reviewer concurs that
the 1975 ‘8-way’ study supports the effectiveness of Diclegis in the treatment of NVP.” This
recent US FDA review quoted the results of this 8-way study (e.g. “The control of nausea by
doxylamine alone and by each of the 3 combination which contain doxylamine was consis-
tently statistically significantly (p<0.01) superior to placebo by both physician’s records and
patient’s records”) but did not mention any of the problems with the study described here, not
even the problem with data integrity that was originally identified by the US FDA. Some parts
of the US FDA’s recent review are redacted. Health Canada currently relies on this trial in sup-
port of the efficacy of doxylamine and pyridoxine [18]. A 2015 Cochrane review [3] concluded
there was insufficient evidence supporting the efficacy of any particular intervention including
doxylamine-pyridoxine. The information presented here including the risk of bias assessment
may be used to decide whether this trial should be included in future systematic reviews.
This manuscript and the supporting materials make information about this previously
unpublished trial easily available for consideration by regulators, researchers, clinicians and
patients. Despite our efforts over several years to obtain available information from regulators
and others who might have information about the study, the utility of publishing this informa-
tion is limited by the lack of some important information including individual participant
level data. Instead of using individual participant level data, we estimated differences between
groups using summary data and based on several assumptions. Other details of the protocol
such as how clinicians judged clinical response or the statistical tests performed could not be
obtained.
Conclusion
The information published here for the first time about this 1970s trial allow for an assessment
of the evidence base supporting the use of commonly used agents for nausea and vomiting of
pregnancy: doxylamine and pyridoxine. While the analyzed data indicate differences from pla-
cebo for several combinations, the questionable data integrity, high drop-out rate, and other
methodological concerns mean that the prescribing of this medication should not be based on
this trial. No firm conclusion about the efficacy or safety of doxylamine or pyridoxine can be
drawn from the limited available information. The claims about the efficacy of doxylamine
and pyridoxine and the clinical practice guidelines and regulatory decisions that are based on
this trial should be revisited. All of the available information about clinical trials of treatments
for nausea and vomiting during pregnancy should be made publicly available so that informed
decisions can be made by regulators, researchers, clinicians and patients.
Supporting Information
S1 Table. Primary reason for dropout for 425 participants (60% of 709 dropouts) provided
in US FDA documents. The source of the information is the US FDA fiche 353, page 4. For
the remaining 284 dropouts, the reasons included: (1) one or more diary cards missing, (2) no
study medication taken 1 or more days, (3) interval of 1 day or more between visit to physician
and starting medication or between diary dates, (4) anti-emetic other than study medication
taken at any time during the study, or (5) miscellaneous. Of these 284, 33 “could not definitely
be classes as dropouts; their status was questionable” (and these participants were “included
with the 251 patients who did not fulfill protocol criteria for other reasons”).
