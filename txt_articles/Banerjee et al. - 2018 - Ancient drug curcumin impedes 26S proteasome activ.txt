Curcumin, the active ingredient in Curcuma longa, has been in
medicinal use since ancient times. However, the therapeutic targets
and signaling cascades modulated by curcumin have been enigmatic
despite extensive research. Here we identify dual-specificity tyrosine-
regulated kinase 2 (DYRK2), a positive regulator of the 26S protea-
some, as a direct target of curcumin. Curcumin occupies the ATP-
binding pocket of DYRK2 in the cocrystal structure, and it potently
and specifically inhibits DYRK2 over 139 other kinases tested in vitro.
As a result, curcumin diminishes DYRK2-mediated 26S proteasome
phosphorylation in cells, leading to reduced proteasome activity and
impaired cell proliferation. Interestingly, curcumin synergizes with the
therapeutic proteasome inhibitor carfilzomib to induce apoptosis in a
variety of proteasome-addicted cancer cells, while this drug combina-
tion exhibits modest to no cytotoxicity to noncancerous cells. In a
breast cancer xenograft model, curcumin treatment significantly re-
duces tumor burden in immunocompromised mice, showing a similar
antitumor effect as CRISPR/Cas9-mediated DYRK2 depletion. These
results reveal an unexpected role of curcumin in DYRK2-proteasome
inhibition and provide a proof-of-concept that pharmacological ma-
nipulation of proteasome regulators may offer new opportunities for
anticancer treatment.

T
he medicinal effects of Curcuma longa or turmeric have been
known since ancient times with earliest reference found in
circa 600 BCE (1, 2). The primary active component of turmeric
is curcumin or diferuloylmethane, a hydrophobic polyphenol
extracted from the rhizomes (1). In more modern times, the
therapeutic potential of curcumin was first reported in 1748 (2, 3)
followed by a review article on the medicinal properties of Cur-
cuma in 1815 (2, 4). In 1937, Albert Oppenheimer carried out a
clinical study and reported a successful therapeutic application of
curcumin on patients with biliary disease (5). Since then, there has
been a growing body of literature (>11,500 publications) claiming
that curcumin has a myriad of therapeutic efficacies in various
diseases including cancer, neurological disorders, topical infec-
tions, etc. (6). Curcumin has been reported to induce anticancer
and antiproliferative activity via multiple pathways including, but
not limited to, induction of apoptosis by caspase activation, down-
regulation of essential transcription factors like NFκB, inhibition
of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and protein tyrosine kinases,
and down-regulation of growth factor receptors like Her2 and
EGFR (7). Traditionally curcumin has been implicated as a
serine-threonine kinase inhibitor by directly inhibiting IKK in the
NFκB pathway (8, 9) and also as a potent inhibitor of GSK3β with
an IC50 of 66 nM (10). Despite the widespread interest in the
therapeutic potential of curcumin, this body of often-controversial
literature has led researchers to term curcumin an improbable
metabolic panacea the exact biological function of which is very
difficult to dissect (6, 11). Although there are various concerns and
contradictions regarding curcumin’s mechanism(s) of action, there
is very strong evidence in general regarding the anticancer prop-
erties of curcumin (12–15). One mechanism of curcumin action
that has been reported is the inhibition of the proteasome (16–21).
Various groups have reported that curcumin acts as a proteasome
inhibitor, resulting in increased p53 levels and induction of apo-
ptosis via mitochondrial caspase activation (16, 17). Despite all
these known modes of action, the exact mechanism of curcumin-
mediated proteasome inhibition has not been convincingly
demonstrated.
The mature 26S proteasome is a complex of 33 distinct sub-
units that catalyzes 80% of eukaryotic protein degradation (22,
23). Recent studies have shown that both proteasome activity
and cellular abundance are dynamically regulated during physi-
ological and pathological processes such as cell differentiation,
aging, neurodegenerative diseases, and cancer (24–29). In fact,
addiction to the proteasome has been identified to be the
Significance
Curcumin is an ancient drug derived from turmeric and has been
found to exhibit potent anticancer properties albeit through
controversial mechanisms of action. Using a biochemical model,
mouse cancer model, and cellular models, we show that curcu-
min is a highly potent and selective inhibitor of dual-specificity
tyrosine-regulated kinase 2 (DYRK2), a positive regulator of the
26S proteasome. Curcumin perturbs 26S proteasome activity via
DYRK2 inhibition in various cancer cells and in the mouse cancer
model leading to impairment of cell proliferation and reduction
of cancer burden in mice. This novel mechanism of action of
curcumin opens up new avenues for potential preventative or
therapeutic strategies in proteasome-addicted cancers like triple-
negative breast cancer and multiple myeloma.

BIOCHEMISTRY
 “Achilles’ heel” of the aggressive basal-like triple-negative breast
cancer (TNBC) (30) and the devastating plasma cell malig-
nancy, multiple myeloma (31). Therapeutic proteasome inhib-
itors bortezomib (Velcade) (31, 32), carfilzomib (Kyprolis) (33),
and ixazomib (Ninlaro) (34) are Food and Drug Administration-
approved with proven clinical benefit in treating early stage and
refractory multiple myeloma.
Given the proteasome’s biological complexity coupled with the
normal cell toxicity of proteasome inhibitor drugs, recent work has
focused on inhibiting the proteasome indirectly by identifying and
targeting proteasome regulators (35, 36). Recently, our laboratory
reported a proteasome regulator, dual-specificity tyrosine-regulated
kinase 2 (DYRK2) that directly phosphorylates the conserved
Thr25 of the ATPase RPT3 subunit of the proteasome (37). In that
study we demonstrated that DYRK2 depletion impairs proteasome
activity and results in accumulation of numerous proteins involved
in diverse cellular processes (37). These DYRK2-depleted cells
exhibited a slower proliferation rate and significantly reduced tu-
mor burden in a mouse xenograft model (37). Taken together, we
established that DYRK2 is a molecular target with promising an-
ticancer potential not only for chemosensitive but also for protea-
some inhibitor-resistant/adapted cancers.
In the current study, we provide evidence that curcumin is a
specific and potent inhibitor of DYRK2 and regulates the pro-
teasome activity via DYRK2 inhibition. Cocrystal structure of
curcumin with DYRK2 reveals that curcumin binds potently to
the active site of DYRK2 via hydrophobic and hydrogen bonds.
Furthermore, curcumin was found to not effect the proteasome
activity of cells with DYRK2 deletion. Notably, curcumin treat-
ment significantly reduced tumor volume in a TNBC mouse
xenograft model, and the tumor volume was comparable to
DYRK2-depleted tumors. The results establish that the in-
hibition of the DYRK2–proteasome axis is the primary mode of
action of curcumin with expanded therapeutic utility in protea-
some inhibitor-resistant cancer burdens.
Results
Curcumin Is a Potent and Selective Inhibitor of DYRK2. The structure
of curcumin is shown in Fig. 1A. Curcumin inhibits DYRK2 with
an IC50 of 5 nM (Fig. 1B) in vitro. To evaluate whether curcumin
could suppress cellular DYRK2 activity, we treated HEK293T
cells with stable DYRK2-FLAG overexpressing with increasing
concentrations of curcumin and assessed curcumin-mediated
changes of RPT3 phosphorylation at Thr25, the major site of
DYRK2 phosphorylation on the proteasome. We observed that
curcumin treatment suppressed pT25 RPT3 phosphorylation in a
dose-dependent manner, with maximal effects observed at in-
hibitor concentrations of 3–10 μM (Fig. 1D). To evaluate the
specificity of curcumin, we also examined the activity of 140
protein kinases, including CMGC kinase family members that
are closely related to DYRKs (Fig. 1C and SI Appendix, Table
S1). Curcumin targeted DYRK2 specifically; curcumin treat-
ment was found to also inhibit DYRK1A, DYRK3, PIM, MLK,
and PHK kinases albeit to a lesser extent compared with
DYRK2. Curcumin had off-target effects on DYRK1A with an
IC50 of 190 nM (Fig. 1E) and on DYRK3 with an IC50 of 20 nM
(Fig. 1F). Contrary to previous literature, curcumin did not ex-
hibit potent inhibition of purified IKKβ (IC50 > 10 μM) (Fig. 1G)
or purified GSK3β (IC50 > 3 μM) (Fig. 1H) in vitro. The results
reveal that curcumin is a highly potent inhibitor of DYRK2 with
off-target effects on related DYRK isoforms.
Structure of DYRK2 in Complex with Curcumin. To elucidate how
curcumin specifically inhibits DYRK2, we crystallized DYRK2
in the presence of curcumin and determined the structure at 2.5 Å
(SI Appendix, Table S2) [Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID code:
5ZTN]. Strong electron densities are present for curcumin,

 allowing confident interpretation of its position (Fig. 2A). Cur-
cumin occupies the ATP-binding pocket of DYRK2 (Fig. 2B).
One of the 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl groups of curcumin
forms hydrogen bonds with the Lys251 (the ion pair Lys), Glu266
(the ion pair Glu), and Asp368 (the DFG Asp) of DYRK2 that
anchors curcumin deep within the ATP-binding pocket of
DYRK2 (Fig. 2C). Ile228, Ala249, Ile285, Phe301, Leu303,
Leu355, and Ile367 are involved in making hydrophobic inter-
actions with curcumin (Fig. 2C). The cocrystal structure of
DYRK2-curcumin clearly reveals that curcumin imparts its in-
hibitory effect on DYRK2 by directly binding to the DYRK2
ATP-binding pocket.
Curcumin Inhibits 26S Proteasome Activity. We reasoned that cur-
cumin, by inhibiting DYRK2, may reduce proteasome activity in
cells. Indeed, curcumin treatment of MDA-MB-231 and HaCaT
cells caused a 25–40% decrease of proteasome activity toward the
fluorogenic peptide substrate Suc-LLVY-AMC without altering
proteasome abundance as indicated by Western blotting (Fig. 3 A
and B). Notably, the same degree of proteasome inhibition was
observed with CRISPR/Cas9-mediated DYRK2 knockout (37),
and yet the DYRK2-null MDA-MB-231 (Fig. 3A) or HaCaT
(Fig. 3B) cells showed no further decrease of proteasome ac-
tivity with curcumin treatment. These results strongly support that
curcumin down-regulates proteasome activity via DYRK2 inhibi-
tion. Moreover, in 293T cells, curcumin treatment reduced all three
types of proteasome peptidase activities (Fig. 3C) and also stabi-
lized UBL-YFP-PEST (37), a short-lived reporter protein that
undergoes rapid ubiquitination and proteasome degradation (Fig.
3D). Remarkable accumulation and stabilization of two other
well-established proteasome substrates, p21Cip1 and IκBα, was also
evident in curcumin-treated cells compared with control (Fig. 3D).
Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of curcumin on proteasome
activity was observed across a panel of TNBC and multiple mye-
loma cell lines (Fig. 3F). Importantly, cotreatment of the TNBC
MDA-MB-231 cell line with curcumin and carfilzomib resulted in
a much stronger proteasome inhibition than either compound
alone (Fig. 3E). Together, these results demonstrate that the
antiproteasome activity of curcumin, due to DYRK2 inhibition,
is similar in different cancer cell types and exhibits synergistic
inhibition with carfilzomib.

mediated synergistic impairment of proteasome activity could
have an effect on cancer cell viability. Interestingly, a marked
synergistic cytotoxicity was observed across four different multiple
myeloma cell lines with a combination index (CI) of <1 (Fig. 4A
and SI Appendix, Table S3). However, noncancerous myeloid cell
AHH1 exhibited modest cytotoxicity toward the combination (Fig.
4A). Similar data were observed in four different triple-negative
breast cancer cell lines with a curcumin-carfilzomib CI <1 for
cytotoxicity in all cancer cells with modest to no effect in non-
cancerous mammary cell line MCF10A (Fig. 4B and SI Appendix,
Table S3). We next used bortezomib-resistant cell lines that were
generated by adaptation to continuous proteasome inhibition (38).
RPMI8226.BR and MM.1S.BR cells were treated with 10 μM
curcumin in parallel with their bortezomib-sensitive WT coun-
terparts. RPMI8226.BR and MM.1S.BR cells exhibited compa-
rable cytotoxicity to 10 μM of curcumin although these cells
were >20- to 100-fold more resistant to bortezomib than their
respective bortezomib-sensitive cells (Fig. 4C). Treatment with
curcumin induced apoptotic cell death with a significant increase
in caspase3/7 activity in multiple myeloma cell lysates (Fig. 4D).
DYRK2-mediated pT25-RPT3 phosphorylation is essential for
proteasomal degradation of cell-cycle regulators and timely progres-
sion of S-phase (37). Curcumin treatment clearly perturbs cell pro-
liferation that is consistent with DYRK2 inhibition. MDA-MB-231

 and 5TGM1-GFP cells treated with curcumin exhibited a markedly
slower rate of cell proliferation compared with DMSO-treated con-
trols (Fig. 4E). However, curcumin treatment of MDA-MB-231
DYRK2 KO cells did not exhibit a further decrease in cell pro-
liferation (Fig. 4E), suggesting that the curcumin-mediated impedi-
ment of cell proliferation is directly linked to DYRK2 inhibition.
Furthermore, curcumin treatment largely blocked the ability of
TNBC cells to migrate in transwell chemotaxis and 3D matrigel in-
vasion assays (Fig. 4F). These results support that curcumin-mediated
DYRK2-proteasome activity impairment has a direct effect on cyto-
toxicity, proliferation, and invasion of proteasome-dependent TNBC
and multiple myeloma cells. It has been previously shown that cur-
cumin shows synergism with proteasome inhibitors resulting in cyto-
toxicity in cancer cells (38); however, our data clearly indicate that
curcumin-mediated
cytotoxicity
is
predominantly
rendered
by
curcumin-mediated inhibition of DYRK2.
Curcumin Reduces Tumor Burden at a Rate Consistent with DYRK2
Inhibition. MDA-MB-231 is a basal-like TNBC cell line shown
to be resistant to proteasome inhibition-mediated cytotoxicity
(30). Our results on cell viability and biochemistry made us won-
der whether curcumin could inhibit the tumorigenic growth of
these cells in vivo. It was documented previously that curcumin
reduces tumor burden in various cancer models at 200 mg/kg–
1 gm/kg body weight (12–15). We have previously reported that
tumors derived from DYRK2 KO cells grow at a significantly
lower rate than those formed by the parental cells (37). To com-
pare the effect of curcumin on tumor growth to DYRK2-depleted
tumor growth, parental and DYRK2 KO MDA-MB-231 cells
were injected s.c. into NOD scid gamma (NSG) immunocom-
promised mice to induce tumor formation. Parental MDA-MB-
231 bearing mice with palpable tumors were randomized into two
groups of n = 5 each, and vehicle control or 300 mg/kg curcumin
was injected intraperitoneally every alternate day. Indeed, curcu-
min treatment significantly reduced tumor burden after 2 wk of
treatment (Fig. 5A), and curcumin-treated tumor weights (Fig.
5B) were comparable with tumors derived from MDA-MB-231
DYRK2 KO cells. Histological examination of the xenograft tu-
mors also showed greatly attenuated Ki-67 staining (a cellular
marker for proliferation) in both curcumin-treated and DYRK2
KO tumors (Fig. 5C). Furthermore, the total proteasome activity
in curcumin-treated tumor lysates were significantly reduced
compared with vehicle-treated tumor lysates (Fig. 5D), thus sug-
gesting the direct contribution of DYRK2 inhibition in tumor
regression. These data strongly support the role of curcumin-
mediated inhibition of the DYRK2–proteasome axis in regulat-
ing cell proliferation in vivo and suggest that targeting proteasome
regulators (such as DYRK2) in combination with proteasome
inhibitors may be a promising approach of anticancer therapy.
Discussion
This current study is a comprehensive report of a major mech-
anism of action of curcumin in alleviating proteasome-addicted
tumor burden. Results show that curcumin potently binds and
inhibits DYRK2 (Figs. 1 and 2), resulting in reduced 26S pro-
teasome activity, (Fig. 3) which leads to impaired cell pro-
liferation with induction of apoptotic cell death, and (Fig. 4)
culminating in reduced tumor growth (Fig. 5). We also report a
comprehensive kinase specificity profile of curcumin (Fig. 1D
and SI Appendix, Table S1), which clearly shows that curcumin is
a highly specific and potent inhibitor of DYRK2 with a >10-fold
higher potency for DYRK2 compared with other DYRK iso-
forms (Fig. 1 E and F). Higher concentrations of ATP had a
modest effect on the IC50 of curcumin for DYRK2 (SI Appendix,
Fig. S1). This suggests that binding of curcumin to DYRK2 is
potentially irreversible. Over the past three decades many groups
have reported that curcumin exhibits therapeutic efficacy in
mouse models for various cancers (12–15) and have shown cur-
cumin to exhibit anti-inflammatory activity via either IKK in-
hibition and down-regulation of NFκB (8, 9) or inhibition of
GSK3β (10). However, in our research, curcumin exhibited an
in vitro IC50 of >10 μM for IKKβ (Fig. 1G) and >3 μM for
GSK3β, which consequently requires >30-μM concentrations of
curcumin in cells to see activity. One possibility is that the down-
regulation of NFκB observed by the various groups is brought
about by the accumulation of IκBα in cells due to impairment of
the proteasome activity by curcumin (Fig. 3C). Moreover,
DYRK isoforms have been known to play a general role in
priming phosphorylation of GSK3 substrates (39), which is pos-
sibly why other researchers have observed changes in GSK3
substrate phosphorylation upon curcumin treatment (10). Vari-
ous other kinases have been reported as potential targets of
curcumin; however, in the absence of proper biochemical ki-
netics, kinase specificity, or target engagement analyses, the
credibility of the reports is dramatically reduced (6). Fig. 1D
shows that 1 μM of curcumin has modest to no effect on JNK
isoforms, HER isoforms, and VEGFR kinases, which were pre-
viously reported to be potential targets (7). In fact, curcumin

 does not inhibit 139 other kinases tested in vitro to the same
extent as DYRK2 (Fig. 1D). Furthermore, curcumin inhibits
DYRK2 in cells at 1–10 μM (Fig. 1C), which is much lower than
30–100 μM as reported previously for other targets. It has also
been convincingly shown that using curcumin at >20 μM leads to
aggregation and rapid degradation of curcumin in standard cell
culture and biochemical assay conditions (6).
To clear all doubts regarding the mechanism of target engage-
ment, we solved the cocrystal structure of DYRK2 with curcumin
bound at 2.5 Å (Fig. 2 and SI Appendix, Table S2) (PDB ID code:
5ZTN). This cocrystal structure of curcumin with a kinase target
reveals that curcumin binds the ATP-binding pocket of DYRK2
via hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions (Fig. 2). To
explain the selectivity of curcumin for DYRK2, we identified that
the essential curcumin-interacting residues in DYRK2, Ile285 and
Ile367, are replaced by valines in DYRK1A and DYRK1B. We
hypothesize that this Ile-Val replacement would result in a slightly
larger pocket in the DYRK1s and reduce the shape comple-
mentarity to curcumin, explaining the selectivity of curcumin for
DYRK2 (SI Appendix, Fig. S2). Alignment with representative
members of distant and closely related CMGC protein kinases (SI
Appendix, Fig. S3) echoes this conclusion. Substitutions of polar
residues, which alter the hydrophobicity of the pocket (e.g., see SI
Appendix, Fig. S3B, F301:Q), or less bulky hydrophobic residues,
which result in a more open pocket (e.g., see SI Appendix, Fig.
S3A, F301:L), are indicative of the resistance of a given kinase to
curcumin. Substitutions of the residues interacting via hydrogen
bonding (Lys251, Glu266, and D368) was not observed in these
alignments, but their conservation in even highly resistant kinases
(e.g., GSK3β) suggests that they are not major contributors to
curcumin specificity. Efforts to generate a curcumin-resistant
mutant of DYRK2 have failed, as the binding of curcumin to
DYRK2 was quite strong and most single mutations either did not
confer drug resistance or dramatically inhibited the kinase activity
of DYRK2. Collectively, these analyses demonstrate that the
majority of curcumin’s specificity toward DYRK2 is garnered by
tight hydrophobic interactions made uniquely possible at the
DYRK2 ATP-binding pocket.
We recently reported that DYRK2 directly phosphorylates the
26S proteasome on the Thr25 of the RPT3 subunit that impedes
the 26S proteasome activity (37). The Thr25 site on RPT3 is
thought to enhance substrate translocation into the 20S protea-
some core, leading to protein degradation (37). Various groups
have previously reported curcumin-mediated impairment of pro-
teasome in cells (16–21); however, the exact mechanism of curcumin
activity has not been not reported. Curcumin treatment inhibits all
three peptidase activities of the proteasome by 10–30% (Fig. 3A).
This effect, however, is not observed in DYRK2-depleted cells (Fig.
3B), clearly suggesting that curcumin targets the proteasome via in-
hibition of DYRK2. Interestingly, curcumin at 10 μM had no sig-
nificant effect in vitro on the activity of affinity-purified proteasome
to degrade BODIPY-casein substrate (SI Appendix, Fig. S4). Loss of
DYRK2 delays the cell cycle by possible accumulation of protea-
some substrates in the cell cycle (37). Consistent with DYRK2 de-
pletion phenotypes, curcumin treatment impedes cell proliferation
(Figs. 4E and 5C) and invasion (Fig. 4F) at concentrations <10 μM
and reduces tumor burden on a TNBC mouse xenograft model at
300 mg/kg body weight dose (Fig. 5 A and B).
Accumulation of proteins with short half-lives (UBL-YFP-
PEST, IκBα, p27Kip1, p21Cip1) (Figs. 3C and 5D) indicates that
curcumin treatment leads to a global reduction of proteasome
activity and that this activity is synergistic with the proteasome
inhibitor carfilzomib (Fig. 3D). The synergism between curcumin
and carfilzomib was observed not only at a biochemical level, but
also in apoptotic cell death in TNBC and multiple myeloma cells
lines (Fig. 4 A, B, and D). Recently, Allegra et al. (38) reported a
synergism between carfilzomib and curcumin toward induction
of cytotoxicity on U266 myeloma cells. Consistent with their
work, we report that eight different “proteasome-adapted” cell
lines exhibit strong synergistic cytotoxicity upon treatment with
carfilzomib and curcumin combination (Fig. 4 A and B and SI
Appendix, Table S3). However, noncancerous cells did not ex-
hibit the similar levels of cytotoxicity (Fig. 4 A and B), thus
conveying the fact that cancer cells with acquired proteasome
resistance could be selectively targeted by the curcumin–carfil-
zomib combination. An important point to note is that higher
concentrations of curcumin are equally fatal for all cells can-
cerous or noncancerous (HaCaT and MCF10A) (SI Appendix,
Fig. S5). Bortezomib-resistant myeloma cells did not exhibit any
significant resistance to curcumin (Fig. 4C). This was expected
since curcumin inhibits the upstream proteasome regulator
DYRK2 and does not dock into the 20S proteasome peptidase
active site that is often mutated in these cell lines (40). Consis-
tent with our cell-based data, we saw a major reduction in the
cell proliferation marker Ki67 in the sections of the curcumin-
treated tumors (Fig. 5C). Tumor reduction upon curcumin
treatment was observed comparable to the volume and weight of
DYRK2-depleted tumors (Fig. 5 A and B). Furthermore, pro-
teasome activity in the curcumin-treated mouse tumors was re-
duced by 30% along with accumulation of p21Cip1 and p27Kip1,
suggesting that curcumin-mediated DYRK2 inhibition success-
fully perturbed proteasome activity in the mouse xenograft
model (Fig. 5D). The phenotypic similarity between curcumin
treatment and DYRK2 depletion reinforces our hypothesis that
curcumin-mediated effects on cell viability, proliferation, in-
vasion, and tumor development are all a direct consequence of
DYRK2 inhibition and impairment of the proteasome activity.
Curcumin has been one of the most controversial yet exten-
sively studied natural products over the past three decades,
having been implicated in a wide range of diseases, often with
contradictory results reported by various groups worldwide (6).

BIOCHEMISTRY
 Considering the poor pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/
PD) of curcumin, there is an unresolved debate on curcumin
treatment as a viable therapeutic option (6). Our current work
establishes curcumin not only as an excellent research tool for
DYRK2 inhibition, but also as a potential therapeutic possibility.
Derivatives of curcumin with improved PK/PD could be viable
treatment options especially for proteasome-dependent highly re-
fractory TNBC or multiple myeloma in the future. With respect to
the vast body of literature on potential targets of curcumin, we do not
claim inhibition of the DYRK2–proteasome axis as the only possible
mechanism of action of curcumin; nevertheless, we have conclusively
established that impairment of proteasome activity by DYRK2 in-
hibition is a major mechanism of action for curcumin in the context
of the alleviation of proteasome-dependent neoplastic malignancies.
