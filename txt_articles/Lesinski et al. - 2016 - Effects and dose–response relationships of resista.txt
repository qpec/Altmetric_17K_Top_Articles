ABSTRACT
Objectives To quantify age, sex, sport and training
type-specific effects of resistance training on physical
performance, and to characterise dose–response
relationships of resistance training parameters that could
maximise gains in physical performance in youth
athletes.
Design Systematic review and meta-analysis of
intervention studies.
Data sources Studies were identified by systematic
literature search in the databases PubMed and Web of
Science (1985–2015). Weighted mean standardised
mean differences (SMDwm) were calculated using
random-effects models.
Eligibility criteria for selecting studies Only
studies with an active control group were included if
these investigated the effects of resistance training in
youth athletes (6–18 years) and tested at least one
physical performance measure.
Results 43 studies met the inclusion criteria. Our
analyses revealed moderate effects of resistance training
on muscle strength and vertical jump performance
(SMDwm 0.8–1.09), and small effects on linear sprint,
agility and sport-specific performance (SMDwm 0.58–
0.75). Effects were moderated by sex and resistance
training type. Independently computed dose–response
relationships for resistance training parameters revealed
that a training period of >23 weeks, 5 sets/exercise, 6–8
repetitions/set, a training intensity of 80–89% of 1
repetition maximum (RM), and 3–4 min rest between
sets were most effective to improve muscle strength
(SMDwm 2.09–3.40).
Summary/conclusions Resistance training is an
effective method to enhance muscle strength and jump
performance in youth athletes, moderated by sex and
resistance training type. Dose–response relationships for
key training parameters indicate that youth coaches
should primarily implement resistance training
programmes with fewer repetitions and higher intensities
to improve physical performance measures of youth
athletes.
INTRODUCTION
Resistance training (RT) is a safe and effective way
to improve proxies of physical performance in
healthy children and adolescents when appropri-
ately
prescribed
and
supervised.1–4
Several
meta-analyses have shown that RT has the potential
to improve muscle strength and motor skills (eg,
jump performance) in children and adolescents.1 5–7
However, youth athletes have different training cap-
acities, adherence, physical demands of activities,
physical conditions and injury risks compared with
their non-athlete peers; so the generalisability of
previous research on youth athletes is uncertain.8–10
To the best of our knowledge, there is only one
meta-analysis available that examined the effects of
RT on one specific proxy of physical performance
(ie, jump performance) and in one age group (ie,
youth aged 13–18 years).11 It is reasonable to
hypothesise that factors such as age, sex and sport
may influence the effects of RT
. Therefore, a sys-
tematic review with meta-analysis is needed to
aggregate findings from the literature in terms of
age, sex and sport-specific effects of RT on addi-
tional physical performance measures (eg, muscle
strength,
linear
sprint
performance,
agility,
sport-specific performance) in youth athletes.
There is also little evidence-based information
available regarding how to appropriately prescribe
exercise to optimise training effects and avoid over-
prescription or underprescription of RT in youth
athletes.12 The available guidelines for RT prescrip-
tion are primarily based on expert opinion, and
usually transfer study findings from the general
population (ie, healthy untrained children and ado-
lescents)
to
youth
athletes.
This
is
important
because the optimal dose to elicit a desired effect is
likely to be different for trained and untrained
youth.13
Therefore, the objectives of this systematic litera-
ture review and meta-analysis were (1) to analyse
the effectiveness of RT on proxies of physical per-
formance in youth athletes by considering potential
moderator variables, including age, sex, sport and
the type of RT
, and (2) to characterise dose–
response relationships of RT parameters (eg, train-
ing period, training frequency) by quantitative ana-
lyses of intervention studies in youth athletes. W
e
hypothesised that (1) RT would have a positive
effect on proxies of physical performance in youth
athletes, and (2) the effects would be moderated by
age, sex, sport and RT type.

and languages: English, German. The reference list of each
included study and relevant review article1

11
15–19 was
screened for title to identify any additional suitable studies for
inclusion in our review.
Selection criteria
Based on the defined inclusion and exclusion criteria (table 1),
two independent reviewers (ML and OP) screened potentially
relevant articles by analysing titles, abstracts and full texts of the
respective articles to elucidate their eligibility. In case ML and
OP did not reach an agreement concerning inclusion of an
article, UG was contacted.
Coding of studies
Each study was coded for certain variables listed in table 2. Our
analyses focused on different outcome categories. If studies
reported multiple variables within one of these outcome cat-
egories, only one representative outcome variable was included
in the analyses. The variable with the highest priority for each
outcome is mentioned in table 2.
If a study solely used other tests, we included those tests in
our quantitative analyses that were most similar with regard to
the ones described above in terms of their temporal/ spatial
structure.
Further, we coded RT according to the following training
parameters: training period, training frequency, and training
volume (ie, number of sets per exercise, number of repetitions
per set), training intensity, temporal distribution of muscle
action modes per repetition, and rest (ie, rest between sets and
repetitions). Training parameters were categorised according to
common classifications of RT protocols.21 If a study reported
exercise progression over the training period, the mean number
of sets per exercise, repetitions per sets, rest between sets and
training intensity were computed.
To obtain sufficient statistical power to calculate dose–
response relationships, we summarised RT types as conventional
RT (ie, machine based, free weights, combined machine based
and free weights, functional training) and plyometric training
(ie, jumping). As it is not possible to classify complex training as
either conventional RT nor plyometric training,22 we excluded
these studies23–27 from dose–response analyses. Our dose–
response analyses were computed independent of age, sex and
sport.
Assessment of risk of bias
The Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) scale was used
to quantify the risk of bias in eligible studies and to provide
information on the general methodological quality of studies.
The PEDro scale rates internal study validity and the presence
of statistical replicable information on a scale from 0 (high risk
of bias) to 10 (low risk of bias) with ≥6 representing a cut-off
score for studies with low risk of bias.28
Statistical analyses
To determine the effectiveness of RT on proxies of physical per-
formance and to establish dose–response relationships of RT in
youth athletes, we computed between-subject standardised mean
differences (SMD=(mean postvalue intervention group−mean
postvalue
control
group)/pooled
standard
deviation).
W
e
adjusted the SMD for the respective sample size by using the
term (1−(3/(4N-9))).29 Our meta-analysis on categoric variables
was computed using Review Manager V
.5.3.4 (Copenhagen:
The Nordic Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane Collaboration,
2008). Included studies were weighted according to the magni-
tude of the respective SE using a random-effects model.

 subgroup, aggregating SMDwm values of specific subgroups,
comparing subgroup effect sizes with respect to differences in
intervention effects across subgroups.31 To improve readability,
we reported positive SMDs if superiority of RT compared with
active control was found. Heterogeneity was assessed using I²
and χ2 statistics.
Owing to a low number of studies in each physical perform-
ance outcome category that completely reported information on
the applied RT parameters, metaregression was precluded.30
According to a scale for determining the magnitude of effect
sizes in strength training research for individuals who have been
consistently training for 1–5 years,32 we interpreted SMDwm as:
trivial (<0.35); small (0.35–0.79); moderate (0.80–1.50); large
(≥1.50). The level of significance was set at p<0.05.
RESULTS
Study characteristics
A total of 576 potentially relevant studies were identified in the
electronic
database
search
(figure
1).
Finally,
43
studies
remained for the quantitative analyses. A total of 1558 youth
athletes participated, and of these, 891 received RT in 62 RT
intervention groups. The sample size of the RT intervention
groups ranged from 5 to 54 participants (table 3).
There were 13 studies (21 RT intervention groups) that
included children, and 29 studies (36 RT intervention groups)
that included adolescents. In terms of biological maturation, only
15 studies reported Tanner stages. Three (5 RT intervention
groups) of those studies examined prepubertal and 12 (15 RT
intervention groups) postpubertal/pubertal youth athletes. Thirty
studies (44 RT intervention groups) included boys only, whereas
4 studies (4 RT intervention groups) included girls only.
Youth athletes were recruited from team sports (soccer (20
studies; 34 RT intervention groups), basketball (9 studies; 11
RT intervention groups), baseball (3 studies; 5 RT intervention
groups), handball (3 studies; 3 RT intervention groups), tennis
(2 studies; 3 RT intervention groups), volleyball (1 study; 1 RT
intervention group)), and strength-dominated sports (swimming
(3 studies; 3 RT intervention groups), track and field (1 study, 1
RT intervention group)). No included study investigated youth
athletes recruited from martial arts or technical/acrobatic sports.
Regarding the type of RT
, 4 studies performed RT using
machines, 4 studies using free weights, 4 studies using both
machines and free weights, 5 studies performed functional RT
, 5
studies performed complex training, and 19 studies applied
plyometric training. Classification of studies was not always feas-
ible due to missing information or group heterogeneity.
The RT interventions lasted between 4 and 80 weeks, with
training frequencies ranging from 1 to 3 sessions per week, 1–8
sets per exercise, 4–15 repetitions per set, and 20–220 s of rest
between sets. Training intensity ranged from 35% to 88% of the
1 repetition maximum (RM). Training parameters (eg, temporal
distribution of muscle action modes per repetition, and rest
in-between repetitions) which have gained attention in the lit-
erature71 were not quantified due to insufficient data.
A median PEDro score of 4 (95% CI 4 to 5) was detected
and only 4 out of 43 studies reached the predetermined cut-off
value of ≥6, which can be interpreted as an overall high risk of
bias of the included studies (table 3).

and
sport-specific
performance
(SMDwm=0.75;
I²=62%; χ2=67.81; df=26; p<0.001; figure 6). By considering
only the four studies with high quality (ie, low risk of bias), RT
had
moderate
effects
on
measures
of
muscle
strength
(SMD=1.07; 1 study), vertical jump (SMDwm=0.89; 3 studies)
and linear sprint performance (SMDwm=1.19; 2 studies); small
effects on agility (SMD=0.28; 1 study); and large effects on
sport-specific performance (SMDwm=1.73; 2 studies).
There was no statistically significant effect of chronological
and/or biological age on any proxy of physical performance.
However, a tendency (p=0.05) towards larger RT effects were
found for proxies of sport-specific performance in adolescents
(SMDwm=1.03)
compared
with
children
(SMDwm=0.50;
table 4). Subgroup analyses indicated that RT produced signifi-
cantly larger effects (p<0.05) on proxies of sport-specific per-
formance
in
girls
(SMDwm=1.81)
compared
with
boys
(SMDwm=0.72; table 4). Given that most included studies
(n=38) examined participants competing in team sports, our
subgroup analyses regarding the moderator variable ‘sport’ is
limited and did not show any significant subgroup differences
(table 4). Subgroup analyses demonstrated that different training
types of RT produced significantly different gains in muscle
strength (p<0.001), agility (p<0.05) and sport-specific per-
formance (p<0.05). Free weight RT showed the largest effects
on
muscle
strength
and
agility,
while
for
sport-specific
performance, complex training produced the largest effects
(table 4).
Dose–response relationships of RT
Training period
There was a significant difference for the effects of conventional
RT on measures of muscle strength (p<0.001), vertical jump
height (p<0.05) and agility (p<0.001; figure 7). The dose–
response curves indicated that long lasting conventional RT
(>23 training weeks) resulted in more pronounced improve-
ments in measures of muscle strength (SMDwm=3.40) and
agility (SMDwm=1.31), as compared with shorter training
periods (<23 weeks). In terms of vertical jump height, a training
period of 9–12 weeks appeared to be the most effective
(SMDwm=1.20).
Training frequency
There were no significant differences between the observed
training frequencies (ie, 1, 2, 3 times per week) for RT as well
as plyometric training (figure 8).
Training intensity
There was a significant difference with regard to the effects of
conventional RT on measures of muscle strength (p<0.01;
figure 9). High-intensity conventional RT (ie, 80–89% of 1
RM) resulted in more pronounced improvements in muscle
strength (SMDwm=2.52) compared with lower training inten-
sities (ie, 30–39%, 40–49%, 50–59%, 60–69%, 70–79% of the
1 RM).

There was a significant difference with regard to the effects of
conventional RT on muscle strength (p<0.01), and a tendency
towards significance for measures of vertical jump performance
(p=0.06; figure 10). Five sets per exercise resulted in more pro-

 performance (p=0.05) depending on the number of sets per
exercise. Four sets per exercise revealed the largest effects for
measures of muscle strength (SMDwm=0.79) and sport-specific
performance (SMDwm=1.84), while three or four sets appear to
be most effective for improving linear sprint performance
(SMDwm=0.95).
Training volume (number of repetitions per set)
There was a significant difference in terms of the effects of
conventional RT on measures of muscle strength (p<0.05;
figure 11). Six to eight repetitions per set produced the largest
effects on muscle strength (SMDwm=2.42). For plyometric
training, there was a tendency towards significance for proxies
of sport-specific performance (p=0.05). Six to 8 repetitions per
set were less effective (SMDwm=0.15), while 3–5 and 9–12
repetitions per set produced similar effects (SMDwm=0.89 and
0.93).
Rest between sets
There was a significant difference for the effects of conventional
RT on measures of muscle strength (p<0.05; figure 12). Three
to 4 min of rest between sets resulted in more pronounced
improvements in measures of muscle strength (SMDwm=2.09),
as compared with shorter durations of rest.
DISCUSSION
This
systematic
review
with
meta-analysis
examined
the
general effects as well as the age, sex, sport and training type-
specific impact of RT on proxies of physical performance in
healthy young athletes. In addition, dose–response relation-
ships of RT parameters were independently computed. The
main findings were: (1) RT has moderate effects on muscle
strength as well as on vertical jump performance, and small
effects on linear sprint, agility and sport-specific performance
in young athletes, (2) the effects of RT were moderated by
the variables sex and RT type, (3) most effective conventional
RT programmes to improve measures of muscle strength in
healthy young athletes comprised training periods of more
than 23 weeks, 5 sets per exercise, 6–8 repetition per set, a
training intensity of 80–89% of the 1 RM, and 3–4 min of
rest between sets.
Effects of RT on physical performance in youth athletes
In general, RT is an effective way to improve proxies of physical
performance
in
youth
athletes,
and
our
findings
support
recently published literature.4 17 72 73 W
e found that the main
effects of RT on measures of muscle strength and vertical jump
performance were moderate in magnitude, with small effects for
secondary outcomes, including linear sprint performance, agility
and sport-specific performance (eg, throwing velocity). The
lower RT effects on secondary outcomes might be explained by
the complex nature of these qualities, with various determinants
contributing to the performance level. For instance, agility
depends on perceptual factors and decision-making as well as
on changes in direction of speed, which is again influenced by
movement technique, leg muscle quality and straight sprinting
speed.74 Thus, muscle strength appears to be only one of several
factors contributing to agility.
W
e recommend the incorporation of RT as an important part
of youth athletes’ regular training routine to enhance muscle
strength and jump performance.
How age, sex, sport and training type moderate RT effects
Age-specific effects of RT in youth athletes
Biological maturity is related to chronological age, and has a
major impact on physical performance in youth athletes.75
However, unlike age, growth and maturation are not linear
factors.76 77 There is often a discrepancy between chronological
age and biological maturity among youth athletes.4 16 78
W
e found no significant differences in effect sizes for any
proxy of physical performance between prepubertal and postpu-
bertal athletes. Similarly, we did not find significant differences

 for the effects of RT on any physical performance measure with
respect to the moderator variable ‘chronological age’ (table 4).
Merely, a tendency (p=0.05) towards higher sport-specific per-
formance gains following RT in adolescents, compared with
children, was identified.
Although a minimum age has been defined at which children
are mentally and physically ready to comply with coaching
instructions,4 our subgroup analyses regarding biological and
chronological age suggest that youth athletes may benefit to the
same extent from RT
, irrespective of age. However, it is import-
ant to note that most studies did not report the biological
maturity status of the participants. Therefore, more research is
needed to elucidate biological age-specific RT effects on physical
performance in youth athletes and to verify our preliminary
findings.
Sex-specific effects of RT in youth athletes
Previous research on the effects of RTon proxies of physical per-
formance in youth athletes has primarily focused on boys.
However, findings from male youth athletes can only partially be
transferred to female youth athletes because the physiology of
boys and girls (eg, hormonal status during puberty) varies. W
e
found that male and female youth athletes show similar
RT-related gains in muscle strength and vertical jump perform-
ance,
but
girls

 improvements in sport-specific performance (SMDwm=1.81)
compared with boys (SMDwm=0.72). This suggests preliminary
evidence that the RT trainability of female adolescent athletes
may be at least similar or even higher compared with males.
Given that girls’ and boys’ physiology changes differently with

 studies only investigating female youth athletes. More research is
needed to elucidate sex-specific RT effects on physical perform-
ance in youth athletes and to verify our preliminary findings.
Sport-specific effects of RT in youth athletes
The effects of RT in elite adult athletes may be specifically mod-
erated by the respective athlete profile of the sport per-
formed.79 80 Whether this is also the case in youth athletes
remains unresolved. Given that most included studies (n=38)
investigated young athletes competing in team sports, our ana-
lyses with regard to the moderator variable ‘sport’ was limited
and did not reveal any significant differences between sports
disciplines (table 4). Therefore, further research has to be con-
ducted to examine if youth athletes respond differently to RT
programmes as per the sport practiced.
Training type-specific effects of RT in youth athletes
Various types of RT have been reported (eg, machine-based RT
,
free weight RT and functional RT). Each of these types has spe-
cific benefits and limitations.20 73 Machine-based RT may repre-
sent a safe environment for young athletes when supervision
cannot be ensured, whereas supervised RT using free weights
allows full range of motion that better mimics sports-specific
movements.20

 weights were most effective to enhance muscular strength and
agility. In addition, complex training produced the largest effect
sizes if the goal was to improve sport-specific performance.
Therefore, the choice of RT types should be variable and based
on
the
exercise
goal
(eg,
enhancing
muscle
strength
or
sport-specific performance).
Dose–response relationships of RT in youth athletes
Planning and designing RT programmes is a complex process
that requires sophisticated manipulation of different training
parameters. Owing to a lack of evidence-based information on
dose–response relationships following RT in youth athletes, it is
quite common for established and effective RT protocols for
healthy untrained children and adolescents to be transferred to
youth athletes. However, this may hinder to fully recruit the
adaptative potential of young athletes because the optimal dose
to elicit the desired effect appears to be different in trained
compared with untrained youth.13 Owing to the observed lim-
itations regarding female youth athletes and biological matur-
ation status in the present meta-analysis, the dose–response
relationships of RT in youth athletes were determined irrespect-
ive of sex and maturity.
In general, the specific configuration of RT parameters deter-
mines the underlying training stimulus and thus, the desired
physiological adaptations. However, significant effects were pre-
dominantly identified for conventional RT parameters for mea-
sures of muscle strength. Therefore, it appears that gains in
muscular strength may be more sensitive to the applied training
parameters of the conventional RT programmes, as compared
with the secondary performance outcomes (eg, linear sprint per-
formance, agility, sport-specific performance).
Training period
The effects of short-term (<24 weeks) RT peaked almost con-
sistently with training periods of 9–12 weeks for both conven-
tional RT and plyometric training. However, our subgroup
analyses indicated significant differences only for conventional
RT for measures of muscle strength and vertical jump perform-
ance. Nevertheless, with regard to strength gains, long-term
(≥24 weeks) conventional RT was more effective in youth ath-
letes (SMDwm=3.40), as compared with short-term conven-
tional RT (SMDwm=0.61–1.24). Thus, it can be postulated that
conventional RT programmes should be incorporated on a
regular basis in long-term athlete development.66 Given that
continuous performance improvements are difficult to achieve
particularly over long time periods, properly varying RT pro-
grammes may avert training plateaus, maximise performance
gains and reduce the likelihood of overtraining.
Regular basketball practice during a detraining/reduced train-
ing period was sufficient to maintain previously achieved muscu-
lar power gains due to its predominantly power-type training
drills.81 Therefore, it is reasonable to hypothesise that regular
training can maintain RT-based gains in muscular strength for
several weeks if similar physical demands are addressed during
regular training. Coaches may reduce the time spent on RT for
several weeks without impairing previously achieved strength
gains during competition periods when the training must
emphasise motor skills and competition demands.
Training frequency
The phase of periodisation, projected exercise loads and the
dose of additional physical training (ie, overall amount of phys-
ical stress) may influence training frequency.21 In order to avoid
overtraining and achieve maximal benefits of RT
, it is important
to allow the body sufficient time to recover from each RT
session. However, if the rest between RT sessions is too long,
adaptive processes from previous RT sessions may get lost.
Most studies performed RT two or three times per week
(figure 8), and there was no significant difference between the
observed training frequencies. To our knowledge, there is no
study available that directly compared the effects of two RT ses-
sions per week as opposed to three sessions for youth athletes.
Although a reduced RT frequency of one session per week may
be sufficient to maintain muscle strength gains following RT for
several weeks,41 82 training twice per week might be preferred
to achieve further gains in muscle strength in youth athletes.
Training volume and training intensity
Both volume and intensity have to be considered when prescrib-
ing RT to maximise physiological adaptations and minimise
injury risk.4 Different configurations of training volume and
intensity result in different forms of physiological stress, which
in turn induce different neural and muscular adaptations.71
Owing to the large methodological variety in dealing with
training intensity during plyometric training, we were not able
to consistently quantify the dose–response relationship for train-
ing intensity with regard to plyometric training.
Conventional RT programmes using average training inten-
sities of 80–89% of the 1 RM were most beneficial in terms of
improving muscle strength in youth athletes. These findings are
in accordance with the position stand of the American College
of Sports Medicine for strength training in adults.83 The
largest effect sizes for muscle strength gains in adults, trained
individuals and athletes were achieved at 80–85% of the 1
RM.8 12 However, it should be noted that the individual per-
centage of 1 RM is a stress rather than a strain factor. Several
studies have indicated that a given number of repetitions
cannot be associated with a specific percentage rate of the 1
RM.78 84 Thus, to individualise RT
, future studies should focus
on finding a valid strain-based method to quantify RT intensity
effectively.
In terms of the number of sets per conventional RT exercise,
our data show similar effect size magnitudes when comparing
single-set (SMDwm=2.41) versus multiple-set conventional RT
programmes (5 sets: SMDwm=2.76). The primary benefit of a
single-set conventional RT is time efficiency. Nevertheless, since
our results for single-set conventional RT are based on two
intervention groups from one study, this finding has to be inter-
preted with caution. Although there was no study that directly
compared the effects of single-set versus multiple-set conven-
tional RT in youth athletes, there is evidence from adult athletes
that single-set conventional RT may be appropriate during the
initial phase of RT
,85 whereas multiple-set conventional RT pro-
grammes should be used to promote further gains in muscle
strength, especially in athletes.86 Therefore, multiple-set conven-
tional RT may be necessary to elicit sufficient training stimuli
during long-term youth athlete development.
Regarding the applied plyometric training, 3 (for vertical
jump) or 4 sets per exercise (for muscle strength, sport-specific
performance) as well as 3–5 or 9–12 repetitions per set (for ver-
tical jump, sport-specific performance) might be beneficial for
youth athletes’ physical performance. However, the movement
quality of plyometric exercises is more important than the total
session volume.87 Therefore, we recommend the use of thresh-
olds for performance variables, such as ground contact time or
performance
indices,
to
determine
individualised
training
volume.87

 Rest between sets
The duration of rest between sets and repetitions depends on
parameters like training intensity and volume. The rest interval
significantly affects the biochemical responses following RT
.71
Owing to an insufficient number of studies that reported the
duration of rest between repetitions, we focused on dose–
response relationships for rest between sets. Long rest periods
(ie, 3–4 min of rest between sets) were most effective for
improving muscle strength following conventional RT in youth
athletes. This is most likely because long rest periods allow ath-
letes
to
withstand
higher
volumes
and
intensities
during
training.
Limitations of this meta-analysis
A major limitation is that we could not provide insights into the
interactions between the reported training parameters. Our ana-
lyses are based on a variety of studies using different combina-
tions of training parameters magnitudes (eg, training frequency,
number of sets, intensity). It remains unclear if performance
gains would still be maximal if, according to the present dose–
response relationships, the optimum of each parameter was
implemented in RT programmes.81 Thus, further research is
necessary to find an analytical method to provide insights into
the interactions between the investigated training parameters.
The modelling of training variables might help to address this
limitation. Holding a set of RT variables constant while chan-
ging the effects of one specific variable could determine the
unique effects of each training variable.
Further limitations of this systematic review and meta-analysis
are the high risk of bias of the included studies (only 4 out of
43 studies reached a PEDro score of ≥6), the considerable het-
erogeneity between studies (ie, I²=41–81%), and the uneven
distribution of SMDs calculated for the respective training para-
meters. In addition, the scale for determining the magnitude of
effect sizes32 is not specific for RT research in children and ado-
lescents. Another limitation is that almost all studies failed to
report RT parameters which had got recent research attention
(eg, temporal distribution of muscle action modes per repeti-
tion).71 Further, studies used traditional stress-based (ie, RM)
instead of recent strain-based (eg, OMNI resistance exercise
scale of perceived exertion88) methods to quantify RT inten-
sity.89 W
e were not able to aggregate the effects of moderator
variables, such as sex and maturation, for the dose–response
relationships due to an insufficient number of studies that specif-
ically addressed these issues.
SUMMARY
RT was effective for improving proxies of physical performance
in youth athletes. The magnitudes of RT effects were moderate
in terms of measures of muscle strength and vertical jump per-
formance, and small with regard to measures of linear sprint,
agility and sports-specific performance in youth athletes. Sex
and RT type appeared to moderate these effects. However, most
studies were at high risk of bias and therefore, the results should
be interpreted cautiously.
A training period of more than 23 weeks, 5 sets per exercise,
6–8 repetitions per set, a training intensity of 80–89% of 1 RM,
and 3–4 min rest between sets were most effective for conven-
tional RT programmes to improve muscle strength in youth ath-
letes. However, these evidence-based findings should be adapted
individually by considering individual abilities, skills and goals.
Specifically, youth coaches should not use high RT intensities
before the youth athlete developed technical skills to adequately
perform the RTexercises.
What is already known on this topic?
▸ Resistance training is safe for children and adolescents if
appropriately prescribed and supervised.
▸ Several meta-analyses have already shown that resistance
training has the potential to improve muscle strength and
motor skills (eg, jump performance) in healthy, untrained
children and adolescents.
What this study adds
▸ This is the first systematic review and meta-analysis to
examine age, sex, sport and training type-specific effects of
resistance training on physical performance measures in
youth athletes.
▸ The effect of resistance training was moderated by sex and
resistance training type. Girls had greater training-related
sport-specific performance gains compared with boys, and
resistance training programmes with free weights were most
effective for increasing muscle strength.
▸ Dose–response relationships for key training parameters
indicate that youth coaches should aim for resistance
training programmes with fewer repetitions and higher
intensities to improve physical performance measures.
