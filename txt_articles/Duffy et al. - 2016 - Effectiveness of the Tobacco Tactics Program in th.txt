Abstract
Introduction—This study determined the effectiveness of the Tobacco Tactics intervention.
Design/setting/participants—This was a pragmatic, quasi-experimental study conducted from 
2010 to 2013 and analyzed from 2014 to 2015 in five Michigan community hospitals; three 
received the Tobacco Tactics intervention, and two received usual care. Smokers (N=1,528) were 
identified during hospitalization, and sent surveys and cotinine tests after 6 months. Changes in 
pre- to post-intervention quit rates in the intervention sites were compared with usual care control 
sites.

 Intervention—The toolkit for nurses included: (1) 1 continuing education unit contact hour for 
training; (2) a PowerPoint presentation on behavioral and pharmaceutical interventions; (3) a 
pocket card entitled “Helping Smokers Quit: A Guide for Clinicians”; (4) behavioral and 
pharmaceutical protocols; and (5) a computerized template for documentation. The toolkit for 
patients included: (1) a brochure; (2) a cessation DVD; (3) the Tobacco Tactics manual; (4) a 1–
800-QUIT-NOW card; (5) nurse behavioral counseling and pharmaceuticals; (6) physician 
reminders to offer brief advice to quit coupled with medication sign-off; and (7) follow-up phone 
calls by trained hospital volunteers.
Main outcome measures—The effectiveness of the intervention was measured by 6-month 
30-day point prevalence, self-reported quit rates with NicAlert® urinary biochemical verification 
(48-hour detection period), and the use of electronic medical record data among non-responders.
Results—There were significant improvements in pre- to post-intervention self-reported quit 
rates (5.7% vs 16.5%, p<0.001) and cotinine-verified quit rates (4.3% vs 8.0%, p<0.05) in the 
intervention sites compared with no change in the control sites. Propensity-adjusted multivariable 
analyses showed a significant improvement in self-reported 6-month quit rates from the pre- to 
post-intervention time periods in the intervention sites compared to the control sites (p=0.04) and a 
non-statistically significant improvement in the cotinine-verified 6-month quit rate.
Conclusions—The Tobacco Tactics intervention, which meets the Joint Commission standards 
for inpatient smoking, has the potential to significantly decrease smoking among inpatient 
smokers.
Introduction
Numerous studies have shown that inpatient cessation programs, including those delivered 
by nurses, have the potential to reach a large number of smokers and are highly 
efficacious.1,2 Inpatient smoking programs capitalize on a teachable moment, take advantage 
of cessation induced by hospital smoking bans, and enroll a higher proportion of patients 
who smoke compared with quit lines.3–5 However, a wide gap exists between efficacious 
interventions and the implementation of such interventions in routine clinical practice.
To bridge the implementation gap, this pragmatic trial was designed to teach real-world 
inpatient nurses how to conduct tobacco-cessation interventions. Over the years, the authors 
have developed, tested, and refined the nurse-administered Tobacco Tactics intervention,6–10 
which is based on the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Guidelines for Smoking 
Cessation.11 As one of six NIH-supported Consortium of Hospitals Advancing Research on 
Tobacco studies, this study determined the effectiveness of the nurse-administered Tobacco 
Tactics intervention among five Trinity Health community hospitals (three intervention and 
two usual care control) using 6-month self-reported and biochemically confirmed smoking 
cessation as the primary outcome.

 Methods
Design
The protocol of the study has been previously described.12 In brief, this study, conducted 
from 2010 to 2013 and analyzed from 2014 to 2015, was a pragmatic, quasi-experimental 
trial initially conducted and analyzed in six Michigan Trinity Health community hospitals 
(matched on size and number of minority patients), of which three were to receive the nurse-
administered Tobacco Tactics intervention and three were to receive usual care, although 
data from one of the control hospitals was not useable owing to a protocol deviation. In 
order to eliminate investigator bias, a random number generator was used to assign the 
hospitals to experimental or control conditions. Although medical surgical units were the 
primary targeted units, the leaders at the hospitals were allowed to include additional units. 
However, nurses and patients on non-targeted units were not followed.
Committed to those who are poor and underserved in its communities, Trinity Health is one 
of the largest multi-institutional Catholic healthcare delivery systems in the nation, serving 
people and communities in 21 states from coast to coast with 91 hospitals and 124 
continuing care locations. Five Trinity Health hospitals in Michigan were included in the 
study. Inclusion criteria for the study were inpatients that:
1.
smoked a cigarette within 1 month prior to hospitalization;
2.
were aged ≥18 years; and
3.
had a projected hospital stay of ≥24 hours.
Excluded were smokers that were:
1.
involved in a concurrent smoking-cessation trial;
2.
non-English speaking; or
3.
not cognitively or physically able to participate.
This study was approved by the IRBs at the University of Michigan and the Trinity Health 
hospitals.
To obtain population quit rates throughout the study, all inpatient smokers were identified 
from the electronic medical record (EMR) and approached by a research assistant to provide 
written informed consent to surveys and a cotinine test. Using a modified Dillman et al. 
approach,13 patients were initially simultaneously mailed a survey and a NicAlert® cotinine 
test strip 6 months after discharge to determine current smoking status. During the pre-
intervention period, the authors learned that patients were “turned off” by the cotinine strips 
and only one person returned a cotinine test without a survey, so beginning in the transition 
period cotinine strips were sent to only those that first returned a survey. Participants were 
given $10 for each survey and $20 for return of a cotinine test. For those that did not return 
surveys or cotinine tests, research assistants (not blinded) made follow-up calls to obtain at 
the very least quit status. For those who could not be contacted by telephone, a programmer 
(blinded) downloaded smoking status and quit date from the EMR and a research nurse (not

 blinded) reviewed text notes for patients that were readmitted to the hospital during the 5 to 
8–month follow-up period to estimate participants’ 6-month cessation status.
Midway through the study in the intervention hospitals only, 76% (1,028/1,352) of targeted 
inpatient registered nurses and licensed practical nurses, along with 317 additional, non-
targeted providers (for a grand total of 1,345 providers) were provided a 1-hour training in 
the Tobacco Tactics intervention. The nurses were aware of the intervention status of their 
hospitals. Although usual care was standard of care in the control hospitals, the intervention 
was standard of care in the intervention hospitals and all smokers, regardless of whether they 
enrolled in the study, were eligible to receive the intervention. Because there was no actual 
intervention in the control hospitals, the pre-intervention patients were the first half of those 
enrolled, and the post-intervention were the second half of those enrolled. In this way, 
receipt of services and quit rates for all patients were determined pre-intervention, during 
training, and post-intervention in both intervention and control groups. At the end of the 
study, nurses in the usual care control hospitals were also trained to conduct the intervention.
The Tobacco Tactics toolkit for nurses included:
1.
1 continuing education unit contact hour for training;
2.
a PowerPoint presentation on behavioral and pharmaceutical interventions;
3.
a pocket card entitled “Helping Smokers Quit: A Guide for Clinicians” 
developed by U.S. DHHS, Public Health Service;
4.
behavioral and pharmaceutical protocols; and
5.
a computerized template for nurse documentation.
The Tobacco Tactics toolkit for patients included:
1.
a brochure;
2.
a cessation DVD;
3.
the Tobacco Tactics manual14;
4.
a 1–800-QUIT-NOW card;
5.
nurse behavioral counseling and pharmaceuticals;
6.
a physician reminder to offer brief advice to quit coupled with medication 
sign-off; and
7.
follow-up phone calls.
When the nurse charted on the documentation template that the patient was given the 
Tobacco Tactics manual, the EMR was programmed to add the patient’s name and phone 
number to a list that was forwarded to Voluntary Services twice weekly. Trained volunteers 
provided peer telephone cessation counseling to patients at 2, 7, 14, 21, and 30 days after 
discharge. The telephone counseling was guided by a script and focused on behavioral 
support,15 which included the 3R’s (Remind, Rehearse, Reward) and the 4D’s (Delay, Deep 
Breathing, Drink Water, and Distract).16,17

 In the Trinity Health system, all inpatients were screened for smoking on the nursing 
assessment. Nurses were instructed to give smokers brief advice to stop smoking. Qualitative 
comments from nurses indicated that smoking medications were rarely prescribed during 
hospitalization.
Measures
The effectiveness of the intervention was measured by two co-primary outcomes: 30-day 
point prevalence abstinence, self-reported quit rates (taken from either the 6-month follow-
up mail or phone surveys or the EMR), and biochemical verification of smoking cessation 
using urinary NicAlert® tests (48-hour detection period), both collected 5–8 months post-
discharge. The outcome measures were agreed upon by all investigators across the 
Consortium of Hospitals Advancing Research on Tobacco studies and were thought to be the 
most accurate and conservative.18 Covariates included demographic characteristics, 
discharge diagnosis and discharge comorbidities using standard ICD-9 code categories,19 the 
Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-C for alcohol use,20 self-rated functional health 
and well-being via the Short Form 36,21 and health status via the EuroQol-5D-5L.22
Statistical Analysis
Summary statistics based on means and SDs or frequencies and percentages were used to 
characterize the sample distribution for all variables. To compare differences in participant 
characteristics between the pre- and post-intervention time period, paired t-tests for 
continuous variables and McNemar’s tests for categorical variables were used. To compare 
the difference between sites at each time point, ANOVA for continuous variables and chi-
square test for categorical variables were used.
A time by site interaction term was the focus of the multivariable model, as this term 
represents the effect of the intervention at sites receiving the intervention relative to the 
control sites, controlling for covariates. A propensity score (commonly used in effectiveness 
studies)23,24 was calculated, which allowed for the aggregation of multiple covariates that 
could not be individually included in the model given the available sample size. Key 
demographic characteristics, including age, sex, and race, as well as all primary diagnoses 
and comorbid conditions were included a priori in the propensity score. Other variables 
included in the propensity score were those that were statistically significantly different 
between:
1.
intervention versus control sites;
2.
pre-intervention versus post-intervention within sites; or
3.
pre-intervention and control sites combined versus post-intervention in 
intervention sites only (those that did not have the propensity to receive 
the intervention compared with those that did not have the propensity to 
receive the intervention).
Based upon these criteria, the following variables (in addition to those named above) were 
included in the propensity score calculation: number of cigarettes smoked per day, number

 of times quit smoking, insurance status, use of other tobacco products, problematic alcohol 
use, ability to conduct self-care, ability to maintain usual activities, and self-rated health.
Generalized linear mixed models (PROC GLIMMIX) were used to estimate the association 
between self-reported smoking cessation and cotinine-validated cessation and intervention 
status, while accounting for the clustering of patients within hospital units. The predictors in 
the model were the propensity score, intervention site (versus control site), time (post- 
versus pre-implementation), and interaction between time and site. Penalized imputation 
(assuming subjects with missing data had not quit) was used for any subject who was 
missing post-intervention data. Given the fairly small number (n=34) and uneven sizes of 
hospital units, the Morel correction for generalized estimating equations was applied25 and 
the two units that had only recruited one participant were excluded. To ensure that the 
propensity score was used appropriately, the authors explored overlap in the distribution of 
the propensity scores among patients in the pre- versus post-intervention groups and whether 
its inclusion in the multivariable modeling decreased the Akaike information criterion fit 
statistic. All analyses were conducted using SAS/STAT, version 9.3.
The sample size was based on power analysis conducted with PASS 2008 software for 
logistic regression analyses to detect a difference of 10% in quit rates between the 
intervention and control sites, considering the uneven mix of sample sizes between those 
two groups, and then adjusted for a design effect to reflect the effect of clustering of the data 
within 34 hospital units. With an intraclass correlation of 0.03, the study needed 1,128 
subjects to obtain 80% power. Thus, with the actual analytic sample size of 1,336, the power 
would be sufficient for detecting the target effect.
Results
Figure 1 shows the recruitment and retention flowchart for the three intervention and two 
control hospitals. A total of 4,013 inpatients were approached, of which 2,136 were eligible. 
Of eligible patients, 1,528 were enrolled in the study between October 2011 and May 2013, 
resulting in a 71.5% participation rate. Of these, 158 were in the transition period and were 
not included in the final analyses. Of the remaining 1,370 (89.7%) enrolled participants, two 
were excluded from multivariable analysis because they were the only participants recruited 
on their unit, and 32 participants were excluded because of missing data necessary to 
calculate a propensity score. Thus, there were 1,336 participants in the final multivariable 
analyses.
The patients in the intervention and control sites were followed fairly concurrently, although 
differences in time to IRB approval, hiring staff, recruitment rates, training nurses, among 
other factors, resulted in some variations among the sites. The pre-intervention periods all 
started within about 3 months of one another (range, October 24, 2011 to February 8, 2012) 
and ended within 7 months of one another (range, February 20, 2012 to September 20, 
2012). The post-intervention periods all started with 5 months of one another (range, May 
31, 2012 to October 26, 2012) and all ended the same month (May 7, 2013, which was the 
study close), except one site that ended on January 30, 2013 because they met their pre-
specified quota early.

 Among the five sites, 175 (11.5%) patients were enrolled at Muskegon Mercy, 429 (28.1%) 
at Ann Arbor, 438 (28.7%) at Grand Rapids, 215 (14.1%) at Muskegon Hackley, and 271 
(17.7%) at Livonia. The first three of these hospitals were intervention sites that had 571 in 
the pre-intervention period and 313 in the post-intervention period. The latter two hospitals 
were control sites that had 242 in the pre-intervention period and 244 in the post-
intervention period.
Of the enrolled participants, 534 (34.9%) were lost to follow-up, 55 (3.6%) died, and 939 
(61.5%) returned follow-up surveys or had their smoking status downloaded/abstracted from 
the EMR. Of the entire sample of 1,528, there were 170 participants that had missing 
outcome data, were readmitted to the hospital during the 6-month follow-up period, and had 
smoking data available. Of these, 155 (92.2%) were identified as current smokers. Ten were 
identified as having quit for 30 days using a variable that indicated date of quit or EMR 
abstraction by the research nurse. The remaining five identified as quit without a quit date 
were imputed as quit, as four of five were either in the pre-intervention period or post-
intervention control; this was thought to be more accurate than classifying them as smokers, 
especially because it biased the results to the null.
Overall, non-responders were more likely to be male (p<0.001), employed (p<0.01), have a 
primary diagnosis of mental disorder (p=0.001), have a shorter length of stay (p<0.05), and 
have poorer self-rated health (p<0.05).
The average age of patients was 47.9 (SD=14.7) years, 49% were male, 77% were white, 
and 68% were unmarried. Less than half completed some college or higher (43%), and only 
29% were currently employed. Participants smoked an average of 15.4 (SD=12.0) cigarettes 
per day, had quit an average of 3.4 (SD=18.5) times prior to the research study, and 
approximately 10% used other tobacco products. The most common discharge diagnoses 
were diseases of the digestive system (13.1%), diseases of the circulatory system (13.1%), 
injury and poisoning (9.9%), and diseases of the respiratory system (8.9%). The most 
common comorbidities were endocrine, nutritional, and metabolic diseases and immunity 
disorders (60.2%); diseases of the circulatory system (53.3%); mental disorders (50.4%); 
diseases of the digestive system (35.5%); symptoms, signs, and ill-defined conditions 
(35.4%); and diseases of the respiratory system (34.3%). There were various differences 
among the five hospitals and also pre- and post-intervention patients within the hospitals; 
these variables were among those added to the propensity score (Table 1).
The propensity-adjusted quit rates by site and time period are shown in Table 2 and were 
very similar to the unadjusted quit rates (data not shown). When combining together all of 
the intervention sites, there was a significant increase in pre- to post-intervention 6-month 
self-reported quit rates (5.7% vs 16.5%, p<0.001), whereas there was no significant change 
in the control group (4.3% vs 5.3%, p=0.688). Cotinine tests were sent to 1,372 participants, 
but only 448 (33%) were returned, as patients commented on follow-up phone calls that they 
were “turned off” by the urinary cotinine strip. Nonetheless, the tests also showed 
significantly higher pre- to post-intervention quit rates in the intervention sites (4.3% vs 
8.0%, p=0.037) compared with the control sites (1.8% vs 2.5%, p=0.683).

 In terms of hospital-specific quit rates, there were significant improvements in pre- to post-
intervention self-reported quit rates in the Ann Arbor (6.8% vs 14.2%, p=0.032) and Grand 
Rapids (5.4% vs 21.6%, p<0.001) intervention sites, while results for the Muskegon Mercy 
smallest intervention site were in the expected direction (6.5% vs 14.8%, p=0.126). There 
were no significant changes in the self-reported quit rates in the control sites. The only 
increase in cotinine-verified quit rates were in the Grand Rapids largest intervention site 
(3.4% vs 10.2%, p=0.029).
Overall, the 448 cotinine tests had a sensitivity of 96% and a specificity of 86%, compared 
with self-reported 7-day point prevalence abstinence. Excluding the 147 cotinine tests 
returned in the transition period, there were no significant differences in cotinine strip return 
rates between quitters and non-quitters and no differential misreporting pre- versus post-
intervention or intervention versus control arm. Cotinine tests showed that 3.5% (7/200) and 
4.0% (4/101) misreported quitting in the pre- versus post-intervention periods, respectively, 
and 3.6% (7/193) and 3.7% (4/108) misreported quitting in the intervention versus control 
arms, respectively.
Analyses demonstrated considerable overlap in propensity score among those who did and 
did not receive the intervention. The propensity score improved the model fit (Akaike 
information criterion, 7418.11) in models without the propensity score as compared with 
(Akaike information criterion, 7218.40) models with the propensity score. Thus, the 
propensity score was retained in the final models.
As shown in Table 3, the propensity-adjusted multivariable analyses showed that there was 
significant improvement in self-reported 6-month quit rates from the pre- to post-
intervention time periods in the intervention sites as compared with the control sites 
(p=0.04). There was a non-significant improvement in cotinine-verified 6-month quit rate; 
the magnitude of the effect of the intervention time by site term was only about half of that 
for the self-reported model.
Discussion
This study is one of the few pragmatic trials that have evaluated the effectiveness of a 
smoking-cessation intervention for inpatient smokers in real-world hospital settings using 
real-world providers, primarily nurses. Both the intervention and usual care quit rates were 
slightly lower than other studies,26–30 where the ranges were 26%–41% for the intervention 
groups compared with 9%–20% in the usual care group across all studies. The reason for the 
lower rates in both groups in this study versus other published studies may be because the 
other studies were mostly (but not all) RCTs conducted in large academic centers and one 
was with cardiac patients known to have higher quit rates,31 whereas this study was a 
pragmatic trial conducted in community hospitals that included all smokers regardless of 
motivation to quit. In all the studies, including this one, quit rates nearly doubled in the 
intervention site and in some cases tripled. The Grand Rapids intervention site did 
particularly well, and although there were no noted differences in fidelity across sites, the 
Grand Rapids site did open the training up to outpatient nurses, which may have provided 
additional follow-up for some patients.

 The Tobacco Tactics intervention was found to be effective and meets the fairly new Joint 
Commission standards, which apply to all inpatient smokers and include tobacco use 
screening, treatment in the hospital, treatment at discharge, and follow-up telephone 
contact.32 Though this study trained staff nurses to integrate smoking-cessation services into 
their routine care, other inpatient studies have used dedicated cessation counselors to provide 
services.29,33 In the authors’ experience, it is unlikely that hospitals will hire dedicated 
smoking-cessation counselors.
Another way to employ dedicated smoking-cessation counselors is referral to telephone quit 
lines (albeit referral alone may not meet Joint Commission standards). Telephone quit lines 
have been shown to be highly effective, but reach only 6%–10% of smokers, primarily those 
most motivated to quit.5 The Tobacco Tactics intervention was offered to all inpatient 
smokers regardless of motivation to quit. Proactive outreach to smokers has been shown to 
improve quit rates.34
Nurses, the largest group of frontline providers, have the potential to reach a large number of 
captive inpatient smokers. Nurses have rapport with patients and can relate the patient’s 
smoking to their medical condition. In addition, nurses are educated in health education and 
can relate the patient’s smoking behavior to their medical comorbidities, thereby enhancing 
motivation to quit. Moreover, nurses can work with physicians to initiate medications and 
write nursing notes.
Smokers have an increased risk of morbidity and mortality, resulting in more hospital stays, 
longer hospital stays, and greater expenses per admission than non-smokers.35 A large 
number of participants had diseases of the circulatory and respiratory system, which are 
often smoking-related. Patients who have experienced health-related consequences from 
smoking have an increased interest in smoking cessation, especially within the first year of 
diagnosis.36 When a patient experiences a life-altering event related to their comorbidities, 
they may be frightened and willing to make changes in their life to prevent future 
reoccurrences.37
About half of the participants had mental health comorbidities and those with mental health 
comorbidities commonly smoke more heavily, have higher nicotine dependence, experience 
more withdrawal symptoms, and have lower quit rates than those without mental health 
disorders.38 Smoking rates have been shown to vary by demographic groups and the sample 
was fairly well represented with equal numbers of men and women, one-quarter being non-
white, and more than half having a high school education or less. Future papers from this 
study will evaluate the effects of the intervention on selected diagnostic and demographic 
subgroups enrolled in the study.
Limitations
Though real-world, non-randomized, effectiveness trials are more feasible and allow for 
implementation in real-world environments, the lack of randomization at the patient level 
may make interpretation of the results more difficult. Although data from one of the control 
hospitals were not useable, the patient sample size was large enough to allow clinically and 
statistically meaningful comparisons with the intervention hospitals. The research assistants

 and research nurse were not blinded, which could potentially introduce bias. The 
participation rate was high (71.5%), and although the follow-up rate was somewhat lower at 
61.5%, the follow-up rate was similar to other inpatient smoking-cessation trials.39,40 
Classifying surviving non-responders as smokers is common in smoking studies, but may 
bias the results.41 The lack of significant changes in the cotinine-verified quit rates in the 
multivariable model was likely due to the low return rate of cotinine strips, and subsequent 
potential overestimation of non-quitting in the case of unreturned strips.
Conclusions
This study showed that there were significant improvements in 6-month quit rates from the 
pre- to post-intervention time periods in the intervention sites compared with the control 
sites. Although hospitalization itself can be a catalyst for quitting, once trained, nurses are 
capable of improving quit rates beyond usual care. The Tobacco Tactics intervention meets 
the Joint Commission standards for treatment of inpatient smokers.
